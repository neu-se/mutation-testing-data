  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).delay
```
This would result in different behavior because `delay` is a different method than `timeout`, and it would not cause the promise to be rejected if it is not fulfilled before the timeout.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).fapply
```
This would result in different behavior because `fapply` is a different method than `timeout`, and it would not cause the promise to be rejected if it is not fulfilled before the timeout.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).fcall
```
This would result in different behavior because `fcall` is a different method than `timeout`, and it would not cause the promise to be rejected if it is not fulfilled before the timeout.

DONE.
