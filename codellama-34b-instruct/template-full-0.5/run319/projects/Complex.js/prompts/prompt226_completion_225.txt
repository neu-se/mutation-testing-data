  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a*a + b*b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` expects a single argument, but `a*a + b*b` would result in a different value than `a` or `b` individually.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp` expects a single argument, but `a*a + b*b` would result in a different value than `a` or `b` individually.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a*a - b*b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` expects a single argument, but `a*a - b*b` would result in a different value than `a` or `b` individually.

DONE.
