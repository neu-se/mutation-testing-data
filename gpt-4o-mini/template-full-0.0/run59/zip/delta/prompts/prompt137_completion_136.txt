Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther == null ||
      typeof firstOther.retain !== 'number' ||
      firstOther.attributes != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the conditions to check for `null` and the type of `retain`, as well as using the inequality operator for `attributes`, which could lead to the code executing the block when it shouldn't.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther != null &&
      typeof firstOther.retain === 'string' &&
      firstOther.attributes == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly checks if `retain` is a string instead of a number, which would cause the condition to fail even when `firstOther` is valid, potentially skipping important logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther != null &&
      typeof firstOther.retain === 'number' &&
      firstOther.attributes !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the check for `attributes` from `== null` to `!== undefined`, which would allow the condition to pass if `attributes` is set to
