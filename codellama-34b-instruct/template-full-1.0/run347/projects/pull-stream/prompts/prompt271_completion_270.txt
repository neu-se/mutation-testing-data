  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment expects a truthy value to indicate the end of the stream, while the value 0 would be falsy and would cause the code to continue reading from the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment expects a truthy value to indicate the end of the stream, while the value 1 would be truthy and would cause the code to immediately exit the loop without reading from the stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!values
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment expects a truthy value to indicate the end of the stream, while the value !values would be falsy and would cause the code to continue reading from the stream.

DONE.
