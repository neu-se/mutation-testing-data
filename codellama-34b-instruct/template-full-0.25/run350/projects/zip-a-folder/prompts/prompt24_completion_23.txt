  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
format: 'zip'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `format` option is set to `'zip'`, which is not the same as the original code fragment `format`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
format: 'tar'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `format` option is set to `'tar'`, which is not the same as the original code fragment `format`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
format: 'gzip'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `format` option is set to `'gzip'`, which is not the same as the original code fragment `format`.

DONE.
