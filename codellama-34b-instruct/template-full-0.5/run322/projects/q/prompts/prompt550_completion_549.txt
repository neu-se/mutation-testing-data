  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(result.value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved, which could cause errors in the code that uses the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(result.value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the value of `result.value` instead of the original value returned by the generator, which could cause errors in the code that uses the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all(result.value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with an array of all the values in `result.value` instead of the original value returned by the generator, which could cause errors in the code that uses the promise.

DONE.
