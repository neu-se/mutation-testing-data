  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if there are any tokens in the array, rather than checking if the array is null. If the array is empty, this condition would evaluate to `false`, whereas the original code fragment would evaluate to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[0] === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the first element of the array is an empty string, rather than checking if the array is null. If the array is empty, this condition would evaluate to `false`, whereas the original code fragment would evaluate to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!tokens.includes('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the array does not contain any empty strings, rather than checking if the array is null. If the array is empty, this condition would evaluate to `true`, whereas the original code fragment would evaluate to `false`.
