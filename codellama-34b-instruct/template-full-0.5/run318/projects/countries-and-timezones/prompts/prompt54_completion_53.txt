  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones.filter(tz => tz.deprecated)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the deprecated timezones, while the original code fragment returns all timezones.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones.map(tz => tz.name)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of timezone names, while the original code fragment returns an object with timezone names as keys and timezone objects as values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones.slice(0, 5)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return only the first 5 timezones, while the original code fragment returns all timezones.

DONE.
