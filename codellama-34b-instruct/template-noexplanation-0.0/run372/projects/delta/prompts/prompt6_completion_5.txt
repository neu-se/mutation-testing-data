  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This change will cause the `reduce` method to iterate over the values of the `attributes` object, rather than the keys. This will likely cause the `diff` function to produce incorrect results, as it relies on the keys of the `attributes` object to determine which attributes have changed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This change will cause the `reduce` method to iterate over the key-value pairs of the `attributes` object, rather than the keys. This will likely cause the `diff` function to produce incorrect results, as it relies on the keys of the `attributes` object to determine which attributes have changed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys.length
```
This change will cause the `reduce` method to iterate over the number of keys in the `attributes` object, rather than the keys themselves. This will likely cause the `diff` function to produce incorrect results, as it relies on
