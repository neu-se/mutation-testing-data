  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y,
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first element of the tuple, which is the bearing in the y direction, instead of the bearing in the x direction.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x,
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the second element of the tuple, which is the bearing in the x direction, instead of the bearing in the y direction.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x*y
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the product of the two elements of the tuple instead of the ratio of the two elements, which is what the original code fragment does.

DONE.
