  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListeners[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only call the first progress listener, rather than all of them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListeners.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call all but the first progress listener, rather than all of them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListeners.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the length of the progress listeners array, rather than the listeners themselves.

DONE.
