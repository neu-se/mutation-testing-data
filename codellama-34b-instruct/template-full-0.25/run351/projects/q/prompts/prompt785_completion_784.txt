  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected.then(function() { throw new Error("rejected"); })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the `rejected` promise, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a new error if it is fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected.then(function() { throw new Error("rejected"); }, function() { throw new Error("rejected"); })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the `rejected` promise with two callback functions, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a new error if it is fulfilled or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected.then(function() { throw new Error("rejected"); }, function() { throw new Error("rejected"); }, function() { throw new Error("rejected"); })
```
This would result in
