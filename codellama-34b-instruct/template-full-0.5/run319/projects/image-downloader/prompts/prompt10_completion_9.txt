  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path.extname()` method would be called on the URL string, rather than the `options.dest` string. This could potentially cause the function to return a different value, or to throw an error if the URL is not a valid path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path.extname()` method would be called on the string representation of the `options.dest` object, rather than the object itself. This could potentially cause the function to return a different value, or to throw an error if the string representation of the object is not a valid path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename(options.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path.basename()` method would be called on the URL string, rather than the `options.dest` string. This could potentially cause the
