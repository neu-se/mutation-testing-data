  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `err, cb` passes the error object to the callback, while the new code fragment `null, cb` passes `null` instead, which could cause the callback to be called with a different set of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `err, cb` passes the error object and the callback function to the `map` function, while the new code fragment `err, null` passes only the error object, which could cause the `map` function to be called with a different set of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `err, cb` passes the error object and the callback function to the `map` function, while the new code fragment `null, null` passes only `null` values, which could cause the `
