Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the context in which the `predicate` function is executed, potentially leading to unexpected results if `predicate` relies on `this` being a specific object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate.call(null, op, index)
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly sets the context of `predicate` to `null`, which may cause issues if `predicate` expects to access properties of `this`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(op, index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the index passed to `predicate`, potentially causing it to process the wrong element or produce incorrect results based on the altered index.

DONE.
