  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1, w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting substring would be one character shorter than the original.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1, w.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting substring would be one character longer than the original.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length, w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting substring would be empty, whereas the original substring would have a length of at least 1.

DONE.
