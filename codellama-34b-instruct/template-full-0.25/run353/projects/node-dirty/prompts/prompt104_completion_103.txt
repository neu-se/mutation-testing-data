  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete(row.key);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets the value of the key to `undefined`, while this new code fragment deletes the key from the data object entirely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(row.key, row.val + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets the value of the key to `row.val`, while this new code fragment sets the value of the key to `row.val + 1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(row.key, row.val * 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets the value of the key to `row.val`, while this new code fragment sets the value of the key to `row.val * 2`.

DONE.
