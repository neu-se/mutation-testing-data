  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b;
```
This would result in different behavior because the semicolon will cause the code to be interpreted as a statement, whereas the original code fragment was an expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the null keyword will cause the code to return null, whereas the original code fragment would return the value of the variable b.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this;
```
This would result in different behavior because the this keyword refers to the current object, whereas the original code fragment refers to the variable b.

DONE.
