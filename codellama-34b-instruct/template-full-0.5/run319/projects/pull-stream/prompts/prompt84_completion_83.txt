  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function would be called with `null` instead of `abort`, which could cause the stream to be read indefinitely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function would be called with `undefined` instead of `abort`, which could cause the stream to be read indefinitely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function would be called with `true` instead of `abort`, which could cause the stream to be read indefinitely.

DONE.
