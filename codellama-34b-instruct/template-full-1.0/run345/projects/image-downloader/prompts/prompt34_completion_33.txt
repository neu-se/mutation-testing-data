  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `res.resume(null);`
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the response data is empty before resuming, while the new code fragment blindly resumes regardless of the response data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `res.resume(undefined);`
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the response data is undefined before resuming, while the new code fragment blindly resumes regardless of the response data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `res.resume('');`
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the response data is a non-empty string before resuming, while the new code fragment blindly resumes regardless of the response data.

DONE.
