  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the orginal code expect "value" to be passed as an argument to resolve the deferred promise, but with "undefined", the promise will be rejected with an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the orginal code expect "value" to be passed as an argument to resolve the deferred promise, but with "null", the promise will be rejected with an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the orginal code expect "value" to be passed as an argument to resolve the deferred promise, but with "0", the promise will be resolved with "0" as the value, which is not the expected behavior.

DONE.
