  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `verb` variable as-is, while the mutated code converts it to uppercase first. This could cause the policy to behave differently for certain actions that have different uppercase and lowercase forms, such as "read" vs. "READ".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `verb` variable as-is, while the mutated code converts it to lowercase first. This could cause the policy to behave differently for certain actions that have different uppercase and lowercase forms, such as "write" vs. "WRITE".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb + "X"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `verb` variable as-is, while the mutated code appends the string "X" to it. This could cause the
