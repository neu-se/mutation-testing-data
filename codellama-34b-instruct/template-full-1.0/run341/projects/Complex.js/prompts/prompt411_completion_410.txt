  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 || b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider any value of `b` to be equal to 0, even if `a` is not 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider any value of `a` to be equal to `b`, even if the values are not equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider any value of `a` and `b` to be equal to 0, even if the values are not equal.

DONE.
