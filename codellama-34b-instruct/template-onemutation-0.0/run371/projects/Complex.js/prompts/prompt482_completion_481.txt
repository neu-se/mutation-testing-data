  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite` is a method that checks if the complex number is at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere, while `isFinite` is a method that checks if the complex number is not at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere. Using `isInfinite` instead of `isFinite` would cause the `isInfinite` method to return `true` for complex numbers that are not at the infinity pole, which would lead to incorrect results in the `isInfinite` method.

DONE.
