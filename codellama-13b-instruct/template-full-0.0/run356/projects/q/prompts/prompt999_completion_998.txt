  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `fail` method to handle errors, while the new code fragment uses the `fail` method to handle errors and also calls the `reject` method on the `deferred` object. This could potentially cause the promise to be rejected with a different error than the one that was originally thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).then(deferred.resolve, deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `fail` method to handle errors, while the new code fragment uses the `then` method to handle errors and also calls the `resolve` method on the `deferred` object. This could potentially cause the promise to be resolved with a different value than the one that was originally returned.
