  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, iter.next().attributes || {}, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the attributes of the next operation instead of the current operation to the predicate function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, iter.peek().attributes || {}, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the attributes of the current operation instead of the next operation to the predicate function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, {}, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an empty attributes object instead of the attributes of the current or next operation to the predicate function.

DONE.
