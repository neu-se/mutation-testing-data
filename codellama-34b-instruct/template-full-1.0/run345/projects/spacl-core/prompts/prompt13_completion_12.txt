  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^/]:|:\/|:+/
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches a wider range of characters after the colon than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^/]:|:\/|:?/
```
This would result in different behavior because it makes the presence of the colon and the slash after it optional.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^/]:|:\/*+|:\+\//
```
This would result in different behavior because it allows the presence of multiple slashes after the colon, which is not allowed by the original code fragment.

DONE.
