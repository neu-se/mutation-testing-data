  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(aborted)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `next` is a function that takes two arguments, `err` and `cb`, but the replacement code fragment `abortCb(aborted)` is a function call that takes only one argument, `aborted`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(aborted)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `next` is a function that takes two arguments, `err` and `cb`, but the replacement code fragment `cb(aborted)` is a function call that takes only one argument, `aborted`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(err, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `next` is a function that takes two arguments, `err` and `cb`, but the replacement code fragment `abortCb(err, cb)` is a function call that
