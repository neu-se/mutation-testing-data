  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > length; i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute in reverse order, starting with the last element in the array and ending with the first element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < length - 1; i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip every other element in the array, starting with the first element and ending with the second-to-last element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < length * 2; i += 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate over every third element in the array, starting with the first element and ending with the last element.

DONE.
