  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisOp.retain === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for `null` explicitly, while the new code fragment uses the `typeof` operator to check for any object type, including `null`. This could cause the code to behave differently if the `retain` property is `null`, as the `typeof` operator would return `'object'` in that case, while the original code fragment would return `false`.

DONE.
