  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the URL would be parsed as an HTTPS URL instead of an HTTP URL, which could cause issues with the URL parsing and normalization.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http://www.'
```
This would result in different behavior because the URL would be parsed as a URL with the "www." subdomain, which could cause issues with the URL parsing and normalization.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http://example.com'
```
This would result in different behavior because the URL would be parsed as a URL with the "example.com" domain, which could cause issues with the URL parsing and normalization.

DONE.
