  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNodeFrame || isInternalFrame
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also check if the stack line is an internal frame, which is not the intended behavior of the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNodeFrame && isInternalFrame
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if the stack line is both a node frame and an internal frame, which is not the intended behavior of the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNodeFrame ^ isInternalFrame
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the stack line is either a node frame or an internal frame, but not both, which is not the intended behavior of the original code fragment.

DONE.
