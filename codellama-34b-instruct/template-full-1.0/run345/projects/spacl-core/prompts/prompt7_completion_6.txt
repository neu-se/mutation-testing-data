  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\//) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement code would match any occurrence of "/" in the specification, instead of matching only the beginning of the specification.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/(\/+){2}/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement code would match any occurrence of two or more consecutive "/" characters in the specification, instead of matching only the beginning of the specification.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.indexOf('/') === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement code would check if the first character of the specification is a "/", instead of checking if the specification begins with "/".

DONE.
