  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseIndex + 1` would be skipped, potentially causing the `slice` function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex + 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseIndex + 1` and `baseIndex + 2` would be skipped, potentially causing the `slice` function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex + 4
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseIndex + 1`, `baseIndex + 2`, and `baseIndex + 3` would be skipped, potentially causing the `slice` function to return a different result.

DONE.
