  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(-1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate over the previous operation, rather than the next one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(length + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate over the next operation, rather than the current one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(length - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate over the previous operation, rather than the current one.

DONE.
