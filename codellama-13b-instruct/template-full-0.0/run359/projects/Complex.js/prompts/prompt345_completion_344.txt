  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinh` function is used instead of `cosh`, which would change the result of the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function is used instead of `sinh`, which would change the result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tanh
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tanh` function is used instead of `cosh`, which would change the result of the calculation.

DONE.
