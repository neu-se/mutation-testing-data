  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a method call on the `this` object, while the buggy code fragment is a method call on the `this` object with the same name as the method being called. This could result in different behavior if the method being called has side effects or if the method being called is overloaded.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a method call on the `this` object, while the buggy code fragment is a method call on the `this` object with the same name as the method being called, followed by an invocation of the method. This could result in different behavior if the method being called has side effects or if the method being called is overloaded.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment
