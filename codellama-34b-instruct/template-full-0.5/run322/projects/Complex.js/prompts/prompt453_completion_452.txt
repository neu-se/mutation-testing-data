  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] - this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the real parts of the two complex numbers instead of the imaginary parts.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] + this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the sum of the imaginary parts of the two complex numbers instead of the difference.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] * this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the product of the imaginary parts of the two complex numbers instead of the difference.

DONE.
