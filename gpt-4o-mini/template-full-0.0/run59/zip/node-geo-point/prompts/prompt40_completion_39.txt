Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly use the cosine function instead of the sine function, leading to an incorrect calculation of the distance between two geographical points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(point1Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly use the sine of `point1Rad` instead of the sine of `point2Rad`, which would yield an incorrect result in the distance calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(point1.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly use the sine of the longitude of `point1` instead of the sine of `point2Rad`, leading to a completely erroneous distance calculation.

DONE.
