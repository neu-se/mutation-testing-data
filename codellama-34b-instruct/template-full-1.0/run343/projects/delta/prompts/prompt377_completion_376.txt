  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength` returns the length of the current op in the iterator, whereas `peekType` returns the type of the current op. If `peekLength` is used instead of `peekType`, the comparison `otherIter.peekType() === 'insert'` will always be false, causing the program to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekAttributes
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekAttributes` returns the attributes of the current op in the iterator, whereas `peekType` returns the type of the current op. If `peekAttributes` is used instead of `peekType`, the comparison `otherIter.peekType() === 'insert'` will always be false, causing the program to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekOp
```
This would result in different behavior because `
