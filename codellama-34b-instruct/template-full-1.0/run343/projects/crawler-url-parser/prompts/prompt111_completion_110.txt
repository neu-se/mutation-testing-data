  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseUrlStr` is no longer a valid URL string, and the `parse()` function would return `null` instead of a parsed URL object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseUrlStr` is no longer a valid URL string, and the `parse()` function would return `null` instead of a parsed URL object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"example.com"
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseUrlStr` is no longer the original URL string, and the `parse()` function would return a parsed URL object for the new URL string "example.com".

DONE.
