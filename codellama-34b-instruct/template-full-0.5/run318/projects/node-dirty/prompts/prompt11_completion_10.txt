  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.delete(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` will remove the key from the map, whereas `get` will return the value associated with the key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, [])
```
This would result in different behavior because `set` will overwrite the existing value associated with the key, whereas `get` will return the existing value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.get(key).push(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` will add the callback to the end of the list of callbacks associated with the key, whereas `get` will return the existing list of callbacks.

DONE.
