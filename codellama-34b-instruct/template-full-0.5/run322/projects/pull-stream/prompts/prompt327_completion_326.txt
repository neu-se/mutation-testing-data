  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end` is a boolean value, while `end && true` is always `true`. This would cause the `once` function to be called with a different argument, potentially leading to different behavior in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end` is a boolean value, while `end || false` is always `false`. This would cause the `once` function to be called with a different argument, potentially leading to different behavior in the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end` is a boolean value, while `!end` is the opposite boolean value. This would cause the `once` function to be called with a different argument, potentially leading to different behavior in the program.

DONE.
