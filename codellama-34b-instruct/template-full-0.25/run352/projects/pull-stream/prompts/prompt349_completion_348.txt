  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test(data.prop)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would test the `prop` property of the `data` object, rather than the `data` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test(data + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would test the `data` object with a value of 1 added to it, rather than the `data` object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test(data.toString())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would test the string representation of the `data` object, rather than the `data` object itself.

DONE.
