  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function would not be called for rejected promises, while the `fulfilled` function would be called for both fulfilled and rejected promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (value) { return value; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function would not be called for rejected promises, while the anonymous function would be called for both fulfilled and rejected promises, and would return the rejection reason as the fulfillment value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (reason) { throw reason; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function would not be called for rejected promises, while the anonymous function would be called for both fulfilled and rejected promises, and would throw the rejection reason as an exception.

DONE.
