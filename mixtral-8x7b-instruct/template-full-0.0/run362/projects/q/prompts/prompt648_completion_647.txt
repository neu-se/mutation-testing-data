 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` array would be replaced with an empty array, causing the `post` method to not receive the intended arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method would receive `null` as the second argument instead of the `args` array, causing unexpected behavior in the method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method would receive `this` as the second argument instead of the `args` array, causing unexpected behavior in the method.

DONE.
