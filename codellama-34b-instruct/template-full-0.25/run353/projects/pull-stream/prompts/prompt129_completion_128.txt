  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i++)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `cb` function with a single argument, while this new code fragment calls it with two arguments. This change would cause the `cb` function to be called with a different set of arguments, which could potentially cause it to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(i++)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `cb` function with a single argument, while this new code fragment calls it with no arguments. This change would cause the `cb` function to be called with a different set of arguments, which could potentially cause it to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(i--)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `cb` function with a single argument, while this new code fragment calls it with a different argument. This change would cause the `cb` function to
