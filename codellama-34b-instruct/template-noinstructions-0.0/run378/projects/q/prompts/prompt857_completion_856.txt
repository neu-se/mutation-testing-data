  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clearInterval
```
This would result in different behavior because `clearInterval` is a different function than `clearTimeout`, and would not clear the timeout set by the `setTimeout` function in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clearTimeout(timeoutId, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `true` as the second argument to `clearTimeout` would also clear any pending timeouts that have been set by the `setTimeout` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clearTimeout(timeoutId, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `false` as the second argument to `clearTimeout` would not clear any pending timeouts that have been set by the `setTimeout` function.

DONE.
