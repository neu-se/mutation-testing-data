Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the sine function instead of the cosine function, leading to incorrect calculations for the secant, which relies on the cosine value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the tangent function instead of the cosine function, which would produce incorrect results for the secant calculation, as it fundamentally alters the mathematical relationship being computed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(a + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compute the cosine of `a + 1`, which is not equivalent to the cosine of `a`, thus leading to incorrect results in the secant calculation due to the added constant.

DONE.
