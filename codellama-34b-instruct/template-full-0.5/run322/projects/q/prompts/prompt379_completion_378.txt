  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function is not being passed the expected `value` argument, which could cause the function to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function is being passed an `undefined` value instead of the expected `value` argument, which could cause the function to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback(null, value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function is being passed an additional `null` argument, which could cause the function to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
