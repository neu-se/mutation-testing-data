  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` is a method that inserts an operation at a specific index in the delta, whereas `concat` is a method that appends a delta to the current delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` is a method that retains a portion of the document, whereas `concat` is a method that appends a delta to the current delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a method that deletes a portion of the document, whereas `concat` is a method that appends a delta to the current delta.

DONE.
