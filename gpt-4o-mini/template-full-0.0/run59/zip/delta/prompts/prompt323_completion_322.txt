Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first element in the slice, potentially causing the `inverted` Delta to miss the first operation that should be included.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to access an invalid index (before the start of the base), which could lead to unexpected results or errors when trying to retrieve operations from the base Delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly advance the base index by an extra position, potentially causing the `inverted` Delta to include operations that should not be included or to miss operations that should be processed.

DONE.
