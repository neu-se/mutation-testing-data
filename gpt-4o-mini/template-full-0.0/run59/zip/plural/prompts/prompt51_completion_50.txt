Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly removes the last two characters of the word before appending 'es', which is not the intended pluralization rule for words ending in 'o'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends 's' instead of 'es' to words ending in 'o', which is not the correct pluralization for those words.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace(/o$/, 'ies') }
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the last 'o' with 'ies', which is incorrect for pluralizing words that end in 'o', as it does not follow the standard pluralization rules.

DONE.
