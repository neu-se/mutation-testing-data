  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex + 1, baseIndex + length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the base Delta from the next index instead of the current index, potentially returning a different slice of the base Delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex, baseIndex + length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the base Delta from the current index to one less than the length, potentially returning a different slice of the base Delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex + length, baseIndex)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the base Delta from the length to the current index, potentially returning a different slice of the base Delta.

DONE.
