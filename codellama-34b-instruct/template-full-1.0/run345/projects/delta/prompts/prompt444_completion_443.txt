  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset - length
```
This would result in different behavior because the operator precedence and mathematics would be incorrect, leading to a different outcome.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.substr()` method is expecting a number as its argument, but `this.offset` is an object with a `length` property, which is not what the method expects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'0'
```
This would result in different behavior because the method is expecting a number, but a string with a value of '0' would be interpreted as a boolean true value, which would cause the method to return the wrong result.

DONE.
