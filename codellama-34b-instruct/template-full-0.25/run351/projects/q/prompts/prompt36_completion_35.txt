  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNodeJS
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `isNodeJS`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `isNodeJS` is `false`, and `false` when `isNodeJS` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNodeJS === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, and `isNodeJS` is a boolean value, so `isNodeJS === false` would evaluate to `true` when `isNodeJS` is `false`, and `false` when `isNodeJS` is `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof isNodeJS === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator checks the type of the variable `isNodeJS`, and `typeof isNodeJS` would evaluate to `"undefined"` when `isNodeJS
