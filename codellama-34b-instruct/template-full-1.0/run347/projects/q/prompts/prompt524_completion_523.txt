  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object + 1
```
This would result in a different behavior because the original code is comparing an object to itself, while with the replaced code, it would be comparing an object to its incremented version.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.length
```
This would result in a different behavior because the original code is comparing an object to itself, while with the replaced code, it would be comparing an object to its length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object[0]
```
This would result in a different behavior because the original code is comparing an object to itself, while with the replaced code, it would be comparing an object to its first element.

DONE.
