  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the queue is empty, while this replacement checks if the queue has at least one element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the queue is not empty, while this replacement checks if the queue is empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the queue is not empty, while this replacement checks if the queue is empty.

DONE.
