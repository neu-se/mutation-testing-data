  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > len
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute, as the condition would always be false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= len
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute one extra time, as the condition would be true one extra time.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i >= len
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute one extra time, as the condition would be true one extra time.

DONE.
