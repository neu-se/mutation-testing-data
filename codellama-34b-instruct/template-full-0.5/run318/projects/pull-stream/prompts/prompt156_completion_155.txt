  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `value` is not null, while this new code fragment checks if `value` is null. This change would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `value` is null, which would result in the `abortCb` function being called with `null` as the second argument, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `value` is not null, while this new code fragment checks if `value` is not null. This change would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` when `value` is null, which would result in the `cb` function being called with `true` as the first argument, which is not the intended behavior.
