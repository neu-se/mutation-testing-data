  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.replace(" ", "");
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would remove all spaces from the `stackLine` string, potentially changing its meaning and causing the `isInternalFrame` function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split(" ").join("");
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method would split the `stackLine` string into an array of substrings using spaces as the delimiter, and then the `join` method would join the substrings back together with no delimiter, potentially changing the `stackLine` string and causing the `isInternalFrame` function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.substring(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring` method would return a substring of the `stackLine` string starting from the second character, potentially changing the `stackLine` string and causing the `
