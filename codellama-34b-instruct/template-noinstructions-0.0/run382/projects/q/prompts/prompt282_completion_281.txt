  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would cause the `become` function to be called with a resolved promise, while `0` would cause it to be called with a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would cause the `become` function to be called with a resolved promise, while `2` would cause it to be called with a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would cause the `become` function to be called with a resolved promise, while `3` would cause it to be called with a rejected promise.

DONE.
