Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content instanceof Array
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `content` is an array instead of a buffer, which would cause the function to incorrectly handle buffer inputs, potentially leading to data loss or corruption.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `content` is strictly equal to `null`, which would bypass the conversion to a UTF-8 string for any non-null buffer, leading to incorrect handling of valid buffer inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof content === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `content` is a string, which would prevent the conversion of buffer inputs to UTF-8 strings, resulting in incorrect output when the input is a buffer.

DONE.
