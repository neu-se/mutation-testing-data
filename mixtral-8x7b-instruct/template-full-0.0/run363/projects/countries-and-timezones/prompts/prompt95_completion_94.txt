 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it specifically checks for the `null` value, whereas the original code checks for falsy values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'country' in window
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the existence of a global variable `country`, which is not related to the `country` object used in the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(countries).includes(countryId)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `countryId` exists as a key in the `countries` object, rather than checking if the `country` object has been initialized.

By introducing these changes, we can evaluate the effectiveness of the test suite in catching unintended behavior caused by mutations in the code. DONE.
