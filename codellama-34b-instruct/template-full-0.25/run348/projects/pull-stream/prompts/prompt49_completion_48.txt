  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i < length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from 0 instead of 1, which could cause the first element of the array to be skipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = length - 1; i >= 0; i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from the last element of the array instead of the first, and would iterate backwards instead of forwards.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = length; i > 0; i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from the length of the array instead of the first element, and would iterate backwards instead of forwards.

DONE.
