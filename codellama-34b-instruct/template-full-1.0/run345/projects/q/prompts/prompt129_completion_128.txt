  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keys.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unshift()` method adds an element to the beginning of an array, whereas the `push()` method adds an element to the end of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keys.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop()` method removes the last element of an array, whereas the `push()` method adds an element to the end of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keys.clear
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clear()` method removes all elements from an array, whereas the `push()` method adds an element to the end of an array.

DONE.
