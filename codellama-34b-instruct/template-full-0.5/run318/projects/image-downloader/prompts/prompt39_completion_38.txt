  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment resolves the promise with the `dest` object, while this new code fragment resolves it with `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(new Error('Request Failed'));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment rejects the promise with a `TimeoutError`, while this new code fragment rejects it with a different error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(res.statusCode);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment resolves the promise with the `dest` object, while this new code fragment resolves it with the status code of the HTTP response.

DONE.
