  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `attempt3[1]` would refer to the first capture group of the regular expression, which is the filename, whereas `attempt3[2]` refers to the second capture group, which is the line number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because `attempt3[3]` would refer to the third capture group of the regular expression, which is the column number, whereas `attempt3[2]` refers to the second capture group, which is the line number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[4]
```
This would result in different behavior because `attempt3[4]` would refer to the fourth capture group of the regular expression, which is the function name, whereas `attempt3[2]` refers to the second capture group, which is the line number.

DONE.
