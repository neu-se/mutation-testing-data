  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err)
```
This code fragment will cause the `cb` function to be called with the `err` argument, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, err)
```
This code fragment will cause the `cb` function to be called with `null` as the first argument and `err` as the second argument, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, null)
```
This code fragment will cause the `cb` function to be called with `err` as the first argument and `null` as the second argument, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

DONE.
