 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the '1' is being added to the imaginary part of the complex number regardless of the value of `tokens[i + 1]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
minus
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `minus` is being added to the imaginary part of the complex number, which is not the same as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because a random number is being added to the imaginary part of the complex number, which is not the same as the original code.

DONE.
