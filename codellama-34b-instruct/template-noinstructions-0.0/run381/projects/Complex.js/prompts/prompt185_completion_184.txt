  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.pow` and `Math.sqrt` have different mathematical properties and will produce different results for the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.pow` and `Math.log` have different mathematical properties and will produce different results for the same input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.pow` and `Math.sin` have different mathematical properties and will produce different results for the same input.

DONE.
