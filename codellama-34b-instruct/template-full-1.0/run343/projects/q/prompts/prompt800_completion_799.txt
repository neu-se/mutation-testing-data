  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.catch
```
This would result in different behavior because the catch() method catches mistakes during the promise chaining and handles them with a callback function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.finally
```
This would result in different behavior because it will continue to execute the function even after throw error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fin
```
This would result in different behavior as it will forward the resolution of the given promise when the callback is done.
