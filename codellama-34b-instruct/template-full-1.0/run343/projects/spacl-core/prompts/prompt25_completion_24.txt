  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
final || opt || min > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has lower precedence than the `&&` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(final || opt) || min > 0`, which would always evaluate to true if `opt` is true or `min` is greater than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
final ? opt : min > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `?` operator has higher precedence than the `&&` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `final ? opt : (min > 0)`, which would always evaluate to `final` if `opt` is true or `min` is greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
final && opt || min > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has lower precedence than the `&&` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as
