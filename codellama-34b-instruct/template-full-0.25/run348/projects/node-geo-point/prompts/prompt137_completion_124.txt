  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
adjust(this.longitude) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `adjust` function would be called with a different argument, which could potentially change the result of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
adjust(this.longitude) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `adjust` function would be called with a different argument, which could potentially change the result of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
adjust(this.longitude) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `adjust` function would be called with a different argument, which could potentially change the result of the function.

DONE.
