  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'load' event is never emitted, leading to potential errors in the code that depends on this event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'load' event would never be emitted, leading to potential errors in the code that depends on this event. Additionally, the 'error' event would be emitted instead, which could cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'_flush'
```
This would result in different behavior because the '_flush' method is not an event, it's a function that writes data to the file, and it would cause an error when called as an event.

DONE.
