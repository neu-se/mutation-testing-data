 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always insert the newOp at the end of the array, instead of considering the index variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an out-of-bounds error when accessing the lastOp variable, which would break the push method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would randomly insert the newOp at a different position in the array, instead of the intended position based on the index variable.

DONE.
