  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(this, point);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDistance` method is not being called, and the `this` and `point` arguments are not being passed to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return GeoPoint.calculateDistance(this, point) + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra 1 is being added to the result of the `calculateDistance` method, which would cause the distance calculation to be off by 1 meter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return GeoPoint.calculateDistance(this, point) * 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the result of the `calculateDistance` method is being multiplied by 2, which would cause the distance calculation to be off by a factor of 2.

DONE.
