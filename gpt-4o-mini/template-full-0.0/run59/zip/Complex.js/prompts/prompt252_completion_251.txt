Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the calculation from using the modified cosine function (cosm1) to the standard cosine function, which does not account for the subtraction of 1, potentially leading to incorrect results in the complex exponentiation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the cosine function with the sine function, which fundamentally alters the output of the complex exponential calculation, leading to incorrect results for the imaginary part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(a) * Math.cos(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a multiplication of the exponential of the real part with the cosine of the imaginary part, which changes the intended calculation of the complex exponential and does not reflect the original logic of the function.

DONE.
