  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when` returns a promise that is resolved with the given object, whereas `Q` returns a promise that is resolved with the given object wrapped in a `Q` instance.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.delay(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.delay` returns a promise that is resolved with the given object after a delay, whereas `Q` returns a promise that is resolved with the given object immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` returns a promise that is resolved with the given object, whereas `Q` returns a promise that is resolved with the given object wrapped in a `Q` instance.

DONE.
