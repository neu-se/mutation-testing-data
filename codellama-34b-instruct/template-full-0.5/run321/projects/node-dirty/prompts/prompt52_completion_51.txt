  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `update` method to always update the value stored at the given key, rather than the value stored at the key that is passed as an argument to the `updater` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(key + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `update` method to update the value stored at the key that is one greater than the key that is passed as an argument to the `updater` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(key - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `update` method to update the value stored at the key that is one less than the key that is passed as an argument to the `updater` function.

DONE.
