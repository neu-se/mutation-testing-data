  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a+b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the sum of `a` and `b` instead of just `a`. In the original code, `a` is just a scalar value, so the result of the calculation would be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a-b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the difference of `a` and `b` instead of just `a`. In the original code, `a` is just a scalar value, so the result of the calculation would be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b-a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the difference of `b` and `a` instead of just `a`. In the original code, `a` is just a scalar value, so the result of the calculation would be incorrect.

DONE.
