  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` callback would not be called with the expected `value` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` callback would not be called with the expected `value` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` callback would be called with the `value` argument set to `0`, which may not be the expected behavior.

DONE.
