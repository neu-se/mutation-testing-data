  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `+` operator, which is not commutative. The new code fragment would always return `2`, regardless of the value of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `*` operator, which is not commutative. The new code fragment would always return `a^2`, regardless of the value of `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `+` operator, which is not commutative. The new code fragment would always return `a + b`, regardless of the value of `a` and `b`.

DONE.
