  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-y
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `x` variable, while the replacement code fragment uses the `y` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + y
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `x` variable, while the replacement code fragment uses the `x + y` expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(x * x + y * y)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `x` and `y` variables, while the replacement code fragment uses the `x * x + y * y` expression.

DONE.
