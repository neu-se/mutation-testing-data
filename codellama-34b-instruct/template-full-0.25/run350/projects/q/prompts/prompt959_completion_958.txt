  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.bind(null)` is a function that returns a new function with the `this` value bound to `null`, whereas `array_slice` is a function that returns a new array with a subset of the elements from the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.call(null)` is a function that calls the `array_slice` function with the `this` value set to `null`, whereas `array_slice` is a function that returns a new array with a subset of the elements from the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.apply(null)` is a function that calls the `array_slice` function with the `this` value
