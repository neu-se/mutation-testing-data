  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'], this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, which would cause the function to calculate the wrong result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be calculating the sum of the real and imaginary parts instead of the product, which would cause the function to return an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be calculating the product of the real and imaginary parts instead of the sum, which would cause the function to return an incorrect result.

DONE.
