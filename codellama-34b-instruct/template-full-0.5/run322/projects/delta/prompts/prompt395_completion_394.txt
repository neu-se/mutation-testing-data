  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.retain` is a different value than `thisOp.delete` and would cause the code to behave differently in the context of the surrounding code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.delete` is a different value than `thisOp.delete` and would cause the code to behave differently in the context of the surrounding code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.length` is a different value than `thisOp.delete` and would cause the code to behave differently in the context of the surrounding code.

DONE.
