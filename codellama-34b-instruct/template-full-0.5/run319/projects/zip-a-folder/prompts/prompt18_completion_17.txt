  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.R_OK & fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the bitwise AND operator (`&`) will only return `true` if both `R_OK` and `W_OK` are true, whereas the bitwise OR operator (`|`) will return `true` if either `R_OK` or `W_OK` is true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.R_OK ^ fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the bitwise XOR operator (`^`) will return `true` if either `R_OK` or `W_OK` is true, but not both.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.R_OK << fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the left shift operator (`<<`) will shift the bits of `R_OK
