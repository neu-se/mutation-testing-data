  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a value of `1`, instead of `0`, which could cause the event listener to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a value of `null`, instead of `0`, which could cause the event listener to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a value of `undefined`, instead of `0`, which could cause the event listener to behave differently.

DONE.
