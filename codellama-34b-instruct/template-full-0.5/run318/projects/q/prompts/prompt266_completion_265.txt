  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the boolean value of `resolvedPromise`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `resolvedPromise` is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, so the `if` statement would only evaluate to `true` if `resolvedPromise` is both truthy and strictly equal to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof resolvedPromise === "boolean"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator checks for the type of the operand, so the `if` statement would only evaluate to `true` if `resolvedPromise` is a boolean value.

DONE.
