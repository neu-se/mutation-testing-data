  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was missing the parentheses, which would cause the `peekLength` method to not be called, resulting in a different value being used in the `Math.min` function.

DONE.
