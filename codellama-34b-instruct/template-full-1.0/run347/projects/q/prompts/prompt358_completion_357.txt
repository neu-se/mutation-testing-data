  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` method is not being called for the new code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` method is being called with a different argument, which could cause the `then` method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` method is being called with a rejection exception, which could cause the `then` method to behave differently.

DONE.
