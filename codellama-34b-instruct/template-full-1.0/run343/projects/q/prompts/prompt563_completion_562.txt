  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a promise to be returned, but `null` is not a promise and would trigger an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a promise to be returned, but `undefined` is not a promise and would trigger an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a promise to be returned, but `Q.reject(exception)` returns a rejected promise, which would trigger an error.

DONE.
