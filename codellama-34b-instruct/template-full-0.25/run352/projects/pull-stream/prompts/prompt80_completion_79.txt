  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbed
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbed` is always truthy, whereas `!cbed` checks if `cbed` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb` is a function, and `!cb` checks if `cb` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!read
```
This would result in different behavior because `read` is a function, and `!read` checks if `read` is falsy.

DONE.
