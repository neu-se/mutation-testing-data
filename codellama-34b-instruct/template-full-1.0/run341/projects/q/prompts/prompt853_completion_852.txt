  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clearInterval(timeoutId);
```
This would result in different behavior because `clearInterval` is a function that stops the repeated execution of a function at specified intervals, while `clearTimeout` is a function that cancels a previously set timeout, which is not what is intended in this context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var timeoutId = setTimeout(function () {
    deferred.reject("Timed out after " + ms + " ms");
}, ms);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new timeout that would reject the promise after the specified time, even if the original promise had already resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (Math.random() < 0.5) {
    clearTimeout(timeoutId);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would randomly decide whether to clear the timeout or not, which would cause the promise to be either resolved or rejected in a non-determ
