  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would start from the first argument instead of the second, which would cause the `nodeArgs` array to be populated with the wrong values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would start from the third argument instead of the second, which would cause the `nodeArgs` array to be populated with the wrong values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would start from the last argument instead of the second, which would cause the `nodeArgs` array to be populated with the wrong values.

DONE.
