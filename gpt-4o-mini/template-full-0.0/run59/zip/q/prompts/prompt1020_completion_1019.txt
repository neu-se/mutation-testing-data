Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because the method being dispatched would change from a "post" action to a "get" action, which may not be supported by the object, leading to unexpected results or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"send"
```
This would result in different behavior because the method name "send" may not exist on the object, causing the dispatch to fail or behave incorrectly compared to the intended "post" method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"undefinedMethod"
```
This would result in different behavior because attempting to dispatch to a non-existent method like "undefinedMethod" would throw an error, whereas the original "post" method is expected to exist and function correctly.

DONE.
