  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `lastOp` is an object, but this replacement checks if it is a string. This could cause the code to behave differently if `lastOp` is a string, as the replacement code would not consider it an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `lastOp` is an object, but this replacement checks if it is a number. This could cause the code to behave differently if `lastOp` is a number, as the replacement code would not consider it an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `lastOp` is an object, but this replacement checks if it is undefined. This could cause the code to behave differently if `lastOp` is undefined,
