  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fail
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fail` is a method that rejects a promise with a specified reason, whereas `Q.done` is a method that is called when a promise is resolved or rejected, and is used to notify the user of the promise's state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a method that rejects a promise with a specified reason, whereas `Q.done` is a method that is called when a promise is resolved or rejected, and is used to notify the user of the promise's state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.then` is a method that is used to specify a callback function to be called when a promise is resolved or rejected, whereas `Q.done` is a method that is called when a promise is resolved or rejected
