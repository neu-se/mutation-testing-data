  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinh` and `cosh` have different ranges and are used to calculate different parts of the complex number. Using `sin` instead of `sinh` would cause the function to calculate the sine of the input, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp1
```
This would result in different behavior because `exp1` is a non-standard function and `Math.exp` is a standard function. Using `exp1` instead of `exp` would cause the function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_b * _b
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` and `_b` are different variables. Using `b * b` instead of `_b * _b` would cause the function to use the wrong value for the square root calculation.

DONE.
