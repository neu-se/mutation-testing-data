  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ic$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches words that end with "ics", while the new code fragment matches words that end with "ic".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ic$|ics$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches words that end with "ics", while the new code fragment matches words that end with either "ic" or "ics".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches words that end with "ics" in a case-insensitive manner, while the new code fragment matches words that end with "ics" in a case-sensitive manner.

DONE.
