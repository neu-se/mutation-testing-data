  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.notOk()
```
This would result in different behavior because `ses.notOk()` is not a valid method in the SES library, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.isNotOk()
```
This would result in different behavior because `ses.isNotOk()` is not a valid method in the SES library, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.notOkay()
```
This would result in different behavior because `ses.notOkay()` is not a valid method in the SES library, and would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
