Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(index, 0, { insert: 'buggy' });
```
This would result in different behavior because it inserts a new operation with a fixed string 'buggy' instead of the intended `newOp`, which could lead to incorrect operations being performed on the `ops` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(index, 0, { delete: 1 });
```
This would result in different behavior because it inserts a delete operation with a fixed length of 1, regardless of the actual `newOp`, potentially altering the intended operations and their effects on the document.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(index, 0, { retain: 0 });
```
This would result in different behavior because it inserts a retain operation with a length of 0, which may not be meaningful in the context of the operations and could lead to unexpected results when processing the `ops` array.

DONE.
