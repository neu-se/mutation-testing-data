  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise.then(function() { return promise; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that resolves to the original promise, causing the loop to run indefinitely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise.then(function() { return null; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that resolves to null, causing the loop to exit immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise.then(function() { throw new Error(); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that rejects with an error, causing the loop to exit immediately and the error to be propagated to the next promise in the chain.

DONE.
