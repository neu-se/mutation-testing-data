  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thisOp` variable represents the current operation in the iterator, and replacing the `PLACEHOLDER` with it would cause the code to always evaluate to `true` if the current operation is not a delete operation, regardless of the value of `otherIter.peekType()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.hasNext()` checks if there are any more operations in the iterator, while `PLACEHOLDER` represents the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekLength()` returns the length of the current operation, while `PLACEHOLDER` represents the current operation itself.

DONE.
