  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!done
```
This would result in different behavior because `!done` is always truthy, whereas `done` is only truthy if the promise has been resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const isDone = true; done = isDone;
```
This would result in different behavior because the assignment `done = isDone` would always evaluate to true, while the original code only evaluates to true if the promise has been resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (done) { isResolved = true; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the assignment `isResolved = true;` would only be made if the promise has been resolved, whereas the original code would always make the assignment.

DONE.
