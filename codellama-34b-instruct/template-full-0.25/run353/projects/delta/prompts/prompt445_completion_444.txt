  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the next operation in the list instead of the current one, which could cause the iterator to skip over operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the previous operation in the list instead of the current one, which could cause the iterator to go back in time.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index + Math.random()]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a random operation from the list instead of the current one, which could cause the iterator to jump around unpredictably.

DONE.
