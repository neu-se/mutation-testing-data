  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value, args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.slice(1)` would return a new array containing all elements of `args` except the first one, whereas `args` would return the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value, [args]
```
This would result in different behavior because `[args]` would create a new array containing `args` as its only element, whereas `args` would return the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value, args.concat(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.concat(value)` would create a new array containing all elements of `args` followed by `value`, whereas `args` would return the original array.

DONE.
