Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the starting index for the arguments from the second argument to the first argument, potentially causing the wrong arguments to be passed to the function being called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it evaluates to `2`, which would skip the first two arguments instead of just the first one, leading to incorrect argument handling in the function call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the last argument's index instead of the second argument, which would cause the function to receive only the last argument instead of all subsequent arguments.

DONE.
