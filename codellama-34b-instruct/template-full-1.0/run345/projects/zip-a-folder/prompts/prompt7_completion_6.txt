  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src
```
This would result in different behavior because the target file path would be the same as the source file path, potentially causing the archive to include the archive file itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath + '.tmp'
```
This would result in different behavior because the target file path would include a temporary file extension, potentially causing the archive to be written to a different file than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath + '.bk'
```
This would result in different behavior because the target file path would include a backup file extension, potentially causing the archive to be written to a different file than expected.

DONE.
