Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String(attempt2[2])
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the line number to a string instead of keeping it as a number, which could lead to type-related issues in subsequent operations that expect a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseInt(attempt2[2], 10)
```
This would result in different behavior because it parses the line number as an integer, which could lead to unexpected results if the line number is not a valid integer string, potentially returning `NaN`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[2] * 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it coerces the line number to a number using multiplication, which may not handle non-numeric strings correctly, resulting in `0` for any non-numeric input instead of the intended line number.

DONE.
