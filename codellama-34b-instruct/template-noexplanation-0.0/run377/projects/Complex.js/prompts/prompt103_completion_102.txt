  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus > 1
```
This change will cause the code to enter the `if` block when there are more than one plus and minus signs in the input string, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus > 2
```
This change will cause the code to enter the `if` block when there are more than two plus and minus signs in the input string, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus > 3
```
This change will cause the code to enter the `if` block when there are more than three plus and minus signs in the input string, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
