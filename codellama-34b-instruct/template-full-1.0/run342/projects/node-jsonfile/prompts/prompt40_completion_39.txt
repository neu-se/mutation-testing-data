  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
writeFileSync: async function (file, obj, options = {}) {
  const fs = options.fs || _fs

  const str = stringify(obj, options)

  await fs.writeFileSync(file, str, options)
},
```
This would result in different behavior because the function is now asynchronous, which would cause the `writeFileSync` function to return a promise instead of a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
writeFileSync: (file, obj, options = {}) => {
  const fs = options.fs || _fs

  const str = stringify(obj, options)

  fs.writeFileSync(file, str, options)
  return null
},
```
This would result in different behavior because the function is now a concise function expression, and the `return null` statement will always be executed, even if the `writeFileSync` function throws an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can
