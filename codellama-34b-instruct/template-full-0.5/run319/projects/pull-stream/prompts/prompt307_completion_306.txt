  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `ended` is only set to `true` when the `read` function returns an error, but here it is set to `true` regardless of whether the `read` function returns an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && !cb
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `cb` is only called when `ended` is `true`, but here it is called when `ended` is `false` and `cb` is not `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || !cb
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `cb` is only called when `ended` is `true`, but here it is called when `ended` is `false` or `cb` is not `null`.

DONE.
