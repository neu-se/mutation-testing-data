  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function computes the sine of an angle, while the `cos` function computes the cosine of an angle.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function computes the sine of an angle, while the `tan` function computes the tangent of an angle.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acos
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function computes the sine of an angle, while the `acos` function computes the arccosine of a value.

DONE.
