  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would start at the third argument instead of the second, potentially including the `this` argument in the resulting array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would only include the first argument in the resulting array, potentially excluding the `this` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would only include the second argument in the resulting array, potentially excluding the `this` argument.

DONE.
