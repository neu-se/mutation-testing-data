  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseInt
```
This would result in different behavior because `parseInt` rounds the input to the nearest integer, whereas `parseFloat` returns the entire floating-point number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseFloat(a) + parseFloat(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds `a` and `b` together, whereas the original code fragment only adds `b` to `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a*b
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies `a` and `b` together, whereas the original code fragment only adds `b` to `a`.

DONE.
