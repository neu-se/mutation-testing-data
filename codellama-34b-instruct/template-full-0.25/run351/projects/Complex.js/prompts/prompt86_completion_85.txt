  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] !== ' ' && !isNaN(tokens[i + 1]) && tokens[i + 1] !== 'i'
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional condition `tokens[i + 1] !== 'i'` would prevent the parser from recognizing the imaginary unit "i" as a valid token.
