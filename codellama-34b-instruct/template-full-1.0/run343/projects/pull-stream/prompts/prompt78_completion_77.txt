  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` function would not be called again, causing the loop to exit after only one iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
break
```
This would result in different behavior because the `break` statement would exit the `while` loop immediately, regardless of whether `cbed` is true or false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be returned as the result of the `read` function, which would cause the `next` function to throw an error.

DONE.
