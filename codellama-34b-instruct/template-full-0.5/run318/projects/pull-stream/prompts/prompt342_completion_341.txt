  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `cb`, so if `cb` is truthy, it will become falsy, and if `cb` is falsy, it will become truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator adds 1 to the value of `cb`, which could change the value of `cb` and potentially cause the `onAbort` function to be called with a different argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of `cb` could be different from the value of `cb`, which could cause the `onAbort` function to be called with a different argument.

DONE.
