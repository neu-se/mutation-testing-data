  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify` method would not be called, which could cause issues with the promise chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify` method would be called with an error object, which could cause issues with the promise chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify` method would be called with `null`, which could cause issues with the promise chain.

DONE.
