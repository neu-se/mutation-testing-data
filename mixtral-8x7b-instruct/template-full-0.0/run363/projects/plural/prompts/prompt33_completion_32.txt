 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
''.concat(w.substr(0, w.length - 2))
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `concat` method instead of the `substr` method to concatenate substrings, which may have different performance characteristics and could potentially introduce subtle bugs if the behavior of `concat` differs from `substr` in edge cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
w.slice(0, w.length - 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `slice` method instead of the `substr` method to extract a substring, which may have different performance characteristics and could potentially introduce subtle bugs if the behavior of `slice` differs from `substr` in edge cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
w.substring(0, w.length - 2)
