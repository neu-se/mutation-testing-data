  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `opLength` variable to determine the length of the operation, but by adding 1 to it, the length of the operation would be increased by 1, which could cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `opLength` variable to determine the length of the operation, but by subtracting 1 from it, the length of the operation would be decreased by 1, which could cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `opLength` variable to determine the length of the operation, but by multiplying it by 2, the length of the operation would be doubled, which could cause the code to behave
