  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator will invert the truthiness of the `end` variable, resulting in the opposite behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator will increment the value of the `end` variable, which could cause the code to skip over a necessary operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operator will decrement the value of the `end` variable, which could cause the code to repeat an unnecessary operation.

DONE.
