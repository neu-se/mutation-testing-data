  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
``` 
currentUrl.baseurl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the base URL instead of the current URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the path component of the current URL, which may be different from the full URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodeURIComponent(currentUrl.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decode the current URL, which could potentially change the result of the comparison.

DONE.
