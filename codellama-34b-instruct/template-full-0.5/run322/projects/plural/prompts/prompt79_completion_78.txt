  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goat'
```
This would result in different behavior because the plural of "goat" is "goats", not "geese".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the plural of "goose" is "geese", not "gooses".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose' + 'es'
```
This would result in different behavior because the plural of "goose" is "geese", not "gooses".

DONE.
