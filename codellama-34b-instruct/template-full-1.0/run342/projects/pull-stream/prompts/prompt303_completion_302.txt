  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
> ended
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return `true`, regardless of the value of `ended`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"ended"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return the string `"ended"`, regardless of the value of `ended`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return `false`, regardless of the value of `ended`.

DONE.
