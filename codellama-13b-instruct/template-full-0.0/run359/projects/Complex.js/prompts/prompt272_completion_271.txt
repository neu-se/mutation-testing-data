  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arg` method would return the real part of the complex number instead of the angle.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arg` method would return the imaginary part of the complex number instead of the angle.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(this['im'], this['re'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arg` method would return the angle of the complex number in radians instead of the real part or imaginary part.

DONE.
