  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick(flush);
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` is a function that schedules `flush` to be called later, but `flush` is not a function that takes any arguments. Calling `flush` with an argument would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick(function() { flush(); });
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` is a function that schedules `flush` to be called later, but `flush` is not a function that takes any arguments. Calling `flush` with an argument would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick(function() { flush(undefined); });
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` is a function that schedules `flush` to be called later, but `flush` is not a function that takes any arguments. Calling `flush` with an argument would cause an
