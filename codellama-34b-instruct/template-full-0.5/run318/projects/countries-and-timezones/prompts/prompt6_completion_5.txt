  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code assumes that the `data` object is not null, but the mutated code would throw a `TypeError` if `data` is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code assumes that the `data` object is defined, but the mutated code would throw a `ReferenceError` if `data` is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code assumes that the `data` object has properties, but the mutated code would return an empty object if `data` is an empty object.

DONE.
