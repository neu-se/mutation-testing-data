  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort == true ? null : abort
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `===` operator is used which checks for both value and type equality, whereas in this replacement, the `==` operator is used which checks for only value equality. This could result in a bug where the code does not behave as expected when the `abort` value is not `null` or `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === false ? null : abort
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `===` operator is used to check for both value and type equality, whereas in this replacement, the `===` operator is used to check for only type equality. This could result in a bug where the code does not behave as expected when the `abort` value is not `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort ? null : abort
```
This would result in different behavior because in the
