  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value is not an array, and the `array_reduce` function would not work as expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty array would not be reduced, and the `array_reduce` function would not work as expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is not an array, and the `array_reduce` function would not work as expected.

DONE.
