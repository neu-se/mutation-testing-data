  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance by one element, potentially skipping over the next operation in the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(thisIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance by the length of the current operation, potentially skipping over multiple operations in the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance by the length of the next operation in the other delta, potentially skipping over multiple operations in the current delta.

DONE.
