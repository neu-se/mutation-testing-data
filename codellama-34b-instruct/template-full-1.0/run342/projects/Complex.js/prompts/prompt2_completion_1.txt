  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x--
```
This would result in different behavior because the `--` operator will decrement `x` by one, which would produce a different result than the original `x` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
--x
```
This would result in different behavior because the `--` operator will decrement `x` by one, which would produce a different result than the original `x` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + x
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add `x` to `x` twice, which would produce a different result than the original `x` value.

DONE.
