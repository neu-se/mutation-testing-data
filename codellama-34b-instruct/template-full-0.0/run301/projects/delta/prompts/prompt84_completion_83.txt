  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = newOp.attributes || {};
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `attributes` is an object and only then assigns it to `newOp.attributes`. However, this new code fragment would always assign an empty object to `newOp.attributes`, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the `attributes` property is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = Object.assign({}, newOp.attributes);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `attributes` is an object and only then assigns it to `newOp.attributes`. However, this new code fragment would always assign a shallow copy of `attributes` to `newOp.attributes`, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the `attributes` property is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = Array.isArray(newOp.attributes) ? newOp.attributes
