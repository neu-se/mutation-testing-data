  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(array.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isArray(array.length)` would always return `false`, since `array.length` is a number and not an array. This would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, and the `else` statement to always evaluate to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(array[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isArray(array[0])` would return `false` if `array[0]` is not an array, and `true` if it is an array. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if `array[0]` is an array, and `false` if it is not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(array[array.length - 1])
```
This would result in different behavior because `
