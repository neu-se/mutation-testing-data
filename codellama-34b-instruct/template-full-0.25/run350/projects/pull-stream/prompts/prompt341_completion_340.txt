  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!seen[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator inverts the truthiness of the expression, so the `if` statement would always evaluate to `true` if `seen[key]` is `false`, regardless of the value of `invert`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
seen[key] === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, so the `if` statement would only evaluate to `true` if `seen[key]` is strictly equal to `true`, regardless of the value of `invert`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
seen[key] && invert
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator short-circuits if the first operand is falsy, so the `if` statement would only evaluate to `true` if `seen[key]` is truthy and `invert` is truthy, regardless of
