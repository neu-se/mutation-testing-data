  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `2` would cause the `nodeArgs` array to have one extra element, which would be the callback function, but the replaced code fragment `1` would cause the `nodeArgs` array to have two extra elements, which would be the callback function and the `undefined` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `2` would cause the `nodeArgs` array to have one extra element, which would be the callback function, but the replaced code fragment `0` would cause the `nodeArgs` array to have no extra elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `2` would cause the `nodeArgs` array to have one extra element, which would be the callback function, but the replaced code fragment `-1` would cause the `nodeArgs` array
