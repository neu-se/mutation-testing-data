  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb of this.verbs
```
This would result in different behavior because `of` is a different operator than `in`, and it would cause the code to iterate over the keys of the `verbs` object rather than the values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb in this.verbs.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the values of the `verbs` object rather than the keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = this.verbs[verb]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the value of the `verb` property of the `verbs` object to the `verb` variable, rather than iterating over the keys of the object.

DONE.
