 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"/".split(linkurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because it splits the string "/" using the linkurl\_path as the separator, instead of splitting the linkurl\_path using "/" as the separator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
linkurl_path.split("")
```
This would result in different behavior because it splits the linkurl\_path into individual characters, instead of splitting it into an array of path segments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
linkurl_path.split(linkurl_parts)
