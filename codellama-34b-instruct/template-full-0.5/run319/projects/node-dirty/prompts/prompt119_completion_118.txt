  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `!this._queue.size` checks if the size of the queue is not 0, while `this._queue.size === 0` checks if the size of the queue is exactly 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `!this._queue.size` checks if the size of the queue is not 0, while `this._queue.length === 0` checks if the length of the queue is exactly 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.isEmpty()
```
This would result in different behavior because `!this._queue.size` checks if the size of the queue is not 0, while `this._queue.isEmpty()` checks if the queue is empty.

DONE.
