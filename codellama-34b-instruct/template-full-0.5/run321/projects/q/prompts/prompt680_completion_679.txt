  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` is now `2`, which means that the first argument of the function will be excluded from the resulting array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument to `array_slice` is now `2`, which means that only the first two arguments of the function will be included in the resulting array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1, -1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument to `array_slice` is now `-1`, which means that all arguments of the function except the last one will be included in the resulting array.

DONE.
