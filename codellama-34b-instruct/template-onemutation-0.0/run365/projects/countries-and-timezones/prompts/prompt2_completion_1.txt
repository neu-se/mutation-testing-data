  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezonesMap(data.timezones)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getTimezonesMap` function with the `data.timezones` object as an argument, which is different from the original code that called the function with the `data` object as an argument. This change would cause the `buildCountry` function to return a different set of timezones for the country, which could potentially cause issues in the application that uses this function.
