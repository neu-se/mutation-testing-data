  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"myKey"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the string "myKey" as the property key, rather than the variable `key` which is presumably intended to hold a dynamic property name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use a substring of the `key` variable, rather than the variable itself, which would change the behavior of the `get` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always pass `undefined` as the property key, rather than the variable `key` which is presumably intended to hold a specific property name.

DONE.
