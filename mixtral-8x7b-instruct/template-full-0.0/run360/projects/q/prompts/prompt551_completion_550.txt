 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would always resolve to `null`, regardless of the value of `result.value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would always resolve to `1`, regardless of the value of `result.value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would always resolve to `result.value + 1`, even if `result.value` is a rejected promise. This could cause confusion and unexpected behavior in the code that uses this function.

DONE.
