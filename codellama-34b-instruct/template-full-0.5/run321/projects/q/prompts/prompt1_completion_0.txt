  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof bootstrap !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code inside the if block would not be executed, as the condition would evaluate to false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof bootstrap === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code inside the if block would not be executed, as the condition would evaluate to false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof bootstrap === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code inside the if block would be executed, as the condition would evaluate to true.

DONE.
