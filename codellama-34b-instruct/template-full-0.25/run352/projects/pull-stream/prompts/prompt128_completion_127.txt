  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `true` always returns `null` as the first argument to `cb`, while the new code fragment `false` would return `end` as the first argument to `cb`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `true` always returns `null` as the first argument to `cb`, while the new code fragment `null` would return `end` as the first argument to `cb`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `true` always returns `null` as the first argument to `cb`, while the new code fragment `undefined` would return `end` as the first argument to `cb`.

DONE.
