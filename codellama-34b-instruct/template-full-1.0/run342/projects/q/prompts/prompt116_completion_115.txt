  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce()` method would start iterating from the second element of the array instead of the first.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.length - index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce()` method would iterate over the array in reverse order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() * this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce()` method would start the iteration at a random index within the array.

DONE.
