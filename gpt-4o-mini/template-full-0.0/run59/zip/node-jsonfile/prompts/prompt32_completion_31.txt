Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the first argument to `stringify`, which would likely cause an error or unexpected output when trying to serialize `null` instead of the intended `obj`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, { encoding: 'utf8' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would override the original `options` with a new object that only specifies the encoding, potentially losing other important options that were originally passed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, { throws: false }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the `throws` option to `false`, meaning that if an error occurs during the stringification process, it would not throw an error, which could lead to silent failures in the application.

DONE.
