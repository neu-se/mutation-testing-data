  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log` and `Math.exp` have different mathematical properties, and using `Math.log` instead of `Math.exp` in the expression would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` and `Math.exp` have different mathematical properties, and using `Math.sin` instead of `Math.exp` in the expression would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` and `Math.exp` have different mathematical properties, and using `Math.sqrt` instead of `Math.exp` in the expression would cause the function to return a different value.

DONE.
