  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { throw new Error("foo"); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with an error, whereas the original code would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return "bar"; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the value "bar", whereas the original code would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return "baz"; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the value "baz", whereas the original code would not.

DONE.
