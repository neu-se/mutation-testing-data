  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method returns a string representing the state of the promise, and the comparison would be case-sensitive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state !== "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method returns a string representing the state of the promise, and the comparison would be case-sensitive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method returns a string representing the state of the promise, and the comparison would be case-sensitive.

DONE.
