  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `reason` variable, which is likely to be an error object, and using `null` instead would cause the promise to be rejected with a `TypeError` instead of the original error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `reason` variable, which is likely to be an error object, and using `undefined` instead would cause the promise to be rejected with a `TypeError` instead of the original error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"reason"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `reason` variable, which is likely to be an error object, and using a string literal instead would cause the promise to be rejected with a `TypeError` instead of the original error.

DONE.
