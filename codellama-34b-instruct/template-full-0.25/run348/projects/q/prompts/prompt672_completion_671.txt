  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `Q` would cause the promise to be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(deferred.reject)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` would cause the promise to be resolved with the value of `deferred.reject`, whereas `Q` would cause the promise to be resolved with the value of `Q`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(deferred.resolve)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected with the value of `deferred.resolve`, whereas `Q` would cause the promise to be resolved with the value of `Q`.

DONE.
