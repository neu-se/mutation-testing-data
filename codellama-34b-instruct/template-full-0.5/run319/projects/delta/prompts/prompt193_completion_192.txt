  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the other iterator has a next operation, while this replacement checks if the other iterator has no next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() !== 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the other iterator's next operation is a delete operation, while this replacement checks if the other iterator's next operation is not a delete operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the other iterator's next operation has a length of 0, while this replacement checks if the other iterator's next operation has a non-zero length.

DONE.
