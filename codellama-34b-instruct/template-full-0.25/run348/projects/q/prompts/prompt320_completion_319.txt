  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op].call(promise, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the context of the function call to the promise object, which may have different properties and methods than the descriptor object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op].bind(promise)(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new function with the context of the promise object, which may have different properties and methods than the descriptor object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op].apply(promise, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the context of the function call to the promise object, which may have different properties and methods than the descriptor object.

DONE.
