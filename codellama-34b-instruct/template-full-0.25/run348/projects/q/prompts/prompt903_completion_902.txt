  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise instead of rejecting it, which could cause the test to pass even if the code is incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` would notify the promise instead of rejecting it, which could cause the test to pass even if the code is incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject("error")
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject("error")` would reject the promise with a specific error message, which could cause the test to fail even if the code is correct.

DONE.
