  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nextType` check is now checking for a "retain" operation, instead of a "delete" operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset < index || !priority
```
This would result in different behavior because the `offset` and `index` variables are now being checked against each other, instead of the `length` and `index` variables. Additionally, the `!priority` check is now being used to determine if the `offset` should be adjusted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'insert' && offset > index
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nextType` check is now checking for an "insert" operation, instead of a "delete" operation. Additionally, the `offset` variable is now being checked against the `index` variable to determine if the `offset` should be adjusted.

DONE.
