```
This would result in different behavior because the `pageurl.path` property is a string representing the path of the URL, while `pageurl` is an object representing the URL as a whole. Using `pageurl.path` would result in a different value being passed to the `gettype` function, which could potentially cause the function to return a different result.

```
This would result in different behavior because the `pageurl.host` property is a string representing the
