  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect()` method returns a promise that resolves to the value of the promise, whereas the original code fragment simply returns the promise. This would cause the `allResolved()` method to return a promise that resolves to an array of promises, rather than an array of values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.value()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `value()` method returns the value of the promise, whereas the original code fragment simply returns the promise. This would cause the `allResolved()` method to return an array of values, rather than an array of promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(value) { return value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then()` method returns a new promise that resolves to the value of the promise, whereas the original code fragment simply returns the promise. This would
