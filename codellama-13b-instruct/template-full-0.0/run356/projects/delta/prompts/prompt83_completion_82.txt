  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isEqual(newOp.attributes, lastOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isEqual` function is not defined in the code, and therefore the comparison would always return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes === lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator is used for strict equality comparison, which would return `true` if the two attributes are the same object, but `false` if they are different objects with the same properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes.equals(lastOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `equals` method is not defined for the `AttributeMap` class, and therefore the comparison would always return `false`.

DONE.
