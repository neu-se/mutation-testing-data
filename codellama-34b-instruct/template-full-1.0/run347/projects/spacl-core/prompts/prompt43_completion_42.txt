  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flatten(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because `flatten(false)` would cause the `parts` array to be flattened only once, regardless of the final segment of the path, whereas the original code would flatten `parts` multiple times if the final segment was a wildcard.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push('/(:[^/]+)')
```
This would result in different behavior because `parts.push('/(:[^/]+)')` would add a pattern to the `parts` array that matches a single character between `/` and `/`, whereas the original code would add a pattern that matches multiple characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push('/([^/+])')
```
This would result in different behavior because `parts.push('/([^/+])')` would add a pattern to the `parts` array that matches a single character between `/` and `/`, whereas the original code would add a pattern
