 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
prev, { [id]: { ...buildCountry(data, id) } }
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of the country object returned by `buildCountry` instead of directly assigning the result of `getCountry(id, options)`. This might cause issues if the original `getCountry` implementation modifies the returned object in some way, while the mutated version does not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
prev, { [id]: buildCountry(data, id) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly assigns the result of `buildCountry(data, id)` instead of using the `getCountry` function. This might cause issues if the `getCountry` implementation has side effects or additional logic that is not present in the `buildCountry` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
prev, { [id]: getCountry(id, { ...options, memoize
