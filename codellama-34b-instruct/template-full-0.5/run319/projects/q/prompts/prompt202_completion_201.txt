  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lines[1].indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the index of the second line instead of the first line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lines[lines.length - 1].indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the index of the last line instead of the first line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lines.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the length of the array instead of the index of the first line.

DONE.
