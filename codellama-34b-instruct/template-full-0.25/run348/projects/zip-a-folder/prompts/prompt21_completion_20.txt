  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `targetFilePath` to create a write stream, while the mutated code uses a hardcoded string "foo".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath + ".txt"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `targetFilePath` to create a write stream, while the mutated code appends ".txt" to the end of `targetFilePath` before creating a write stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.join(targetFilePath, "foo")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `targetFilePath` to create a write stream, while the mutated code uses `path.join()` to create a new path by concatenating `targetFilePath` with "foo".

DONE.
