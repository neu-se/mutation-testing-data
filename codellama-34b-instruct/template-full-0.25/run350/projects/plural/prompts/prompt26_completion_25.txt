  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method would return the first character of the word instead of the last two characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method would return the last character of the word instead of the first two characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(w.length / 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method would return the middle character of the word instead of the first two characters.

DONE.
