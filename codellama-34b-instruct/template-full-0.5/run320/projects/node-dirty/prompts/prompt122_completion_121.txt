  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is changed, causing the `drain` event to be emitted instead of the `error` event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is changed, causing the `drain` event to be emitted instead of the `end` event.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'read_close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is changed, causing the `drain` event to be emitted instead of the `read_close` event.

DONE.
