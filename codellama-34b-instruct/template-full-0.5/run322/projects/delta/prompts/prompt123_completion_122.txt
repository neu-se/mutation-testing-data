  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= end && iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<=` operator is used instead of `<`, which would cause the loop to run one extra time, potentially resulting in an out-of-bounds error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < end || iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is used instead of `&&`, which would cause the loop to run indefinitely if `iter.hasNext()` is always true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < end - 1 && iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end - 1` expression is used instead of `end`, which would cause the loop to terminate one iteration earlier.

DONE.
