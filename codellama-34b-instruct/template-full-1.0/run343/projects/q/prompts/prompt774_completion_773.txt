  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(promises)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` returns a rejected promise, while `promises` returns an array of promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(promises, function() {
    throw new Error("Test error");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when` returns a promise that is fulfilled when all the input promises are resolved, while the above code throws an error immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.allSettled(promises)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.allSettled` returns a promise that is fulfilled when all the input promises are settled, while the original code uses `Q.when` which returns a promise that is fulfilled when all the input promises are resolved.

DONE.
