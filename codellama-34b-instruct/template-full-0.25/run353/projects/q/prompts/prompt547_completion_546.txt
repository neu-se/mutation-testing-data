  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a function that resolves a promise with a value or the result of another promise, whereas `reject` is a function that rejects a promise with a reason or the result of another promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("reject")
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` throws an exception, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the thrown value as the reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` returns a rejected promise with the given reason, whereas `reject` is a function that rejects a promise with a reason or the result of another promise.

DONE.
