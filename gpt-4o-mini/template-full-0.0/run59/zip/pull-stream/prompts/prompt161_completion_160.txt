Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(new Error('Abort called'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces an error into the callback, which changes the expected flow of execution and may cause the tests to fail if they do not handle errors properly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the second argument of the callback from the expected value to a boolean `false`, which may lead to incorrect handling of the response in the calling code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(undefined, value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes `undefined` as the first argument instead of `null`, which could lead to different error handling or assumptions in the consuming code about the nature of the response.

DONE.
