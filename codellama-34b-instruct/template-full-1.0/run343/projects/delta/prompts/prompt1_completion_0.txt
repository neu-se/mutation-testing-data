  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `a` is not an object, while this new code checks if `a` is an object. The code that follows the check assumes that `a` is not an object, so it would not work correctly if `a` actually is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `a` is not the `null` object, while this new code checks if `a` is not the empty object. The code that follows the check assumes that `a` is not `null`, so it would not work correctly if `a` actually is `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `a` is not `true`, while this new code checks if `a` is not truthy. The code that follows
