 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve.apply(deferred, [null].concat(nodeArgs))
```
This would result in different behavior because the Node.js callback would be called synchronously with a null value instead of being called asynchronously with the result or error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject(new Error('Artificial error'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the Node.js callback would always be rejected with an artificial error, regardless of the actual result or error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve(nodeArgs)
```
This would result in different behavior because the Node.js callback would be called with the `nodeArgs` array as the result instead of the actual result or error.

DONE.
