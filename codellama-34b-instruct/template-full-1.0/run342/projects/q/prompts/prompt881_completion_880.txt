  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.notify()` method is not a function of the `deferred` object, and it would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.reject()` method would be called immediately after the `deferred` object is created, which would cause the promise to be rejected and not to be resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.fapply([null]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.fapply()` method is not a function of the `deferred` object, and it would cause an error.

DONE.
