  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that is not a function, and attempting to call it as a function would result in a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'hello'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a number (specifically, zero), and attempting to generate a random number using the `Math.random()` function with a string argument would result in a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return 'hello' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a number (specifically, zero), and attempting to generate a random number using a function that always returns the same string would result in a different outcome than the original code.

DONE.
