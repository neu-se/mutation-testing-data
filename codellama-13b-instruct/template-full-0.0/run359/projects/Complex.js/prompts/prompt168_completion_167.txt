  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method would be called with a different argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method would be called with a different argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `re` property would be accessed with a different argument.

DONE.
