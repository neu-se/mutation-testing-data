  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.name === "StopIteration"
```
This would result in different behavior because `isStopIteration(exception)` checks if the exception is an instance of the `StopIteration` class, while `exception.name === "StopIteration"` checks if the exception's `name` property is "StopIteration".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.constructor === StopIteration
```
This would result in different behavior because `isStopIteration(exception)` checks if the exception is an instance of the `StopIteration` class, while `exception.constructor === StopIteration` checks if the exception's constructor is the `StopIteration` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception instanceof StopIteration
```
This would result in different behavior because `isStopIteration(exception)` checks if the exception is an instance of the `StopIteration` class, while `exception instanceof StopIteration` checks if the exception is an instance
