  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'function' && a.length === 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment checks if the `a` function has a length of 2, whereas the original code fragment checks if it has a length of 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'object' && a.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment checks if `a` is an object and has a length of 1, whereas the original code fragment checks if `a` is a function and has a length of 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'function' && a.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment checks if the `a` function has a length of 0, whereas the original code fragment checks if it has a length of 1.

DONE.
