  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by 1 step, which could cause the code to skip over some operations in the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(Infinity)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator to the end of the delta, which could cause the code to skip over all operations in the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(Math.random())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by a random number of steps, which could cause the code to skip over some operations in the delta.

DONE.
