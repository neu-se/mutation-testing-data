  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` will remove the last element of the queue (as opposed to `length` which simply returns the queue's length).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift()` will remove the first element of the queue (as opposed to `length` which simply returns the queue's length).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `reverse()` will reverse the order of the elements in the queue (as opposed to `length` which simply returns the queue's length).

DONE.
