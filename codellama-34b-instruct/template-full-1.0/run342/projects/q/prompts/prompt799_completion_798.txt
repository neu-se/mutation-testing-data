  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of `object`, whereas replacing it with `undefined` would return `undefined` instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of `object`, whereas replacing it with `null` would return `null` instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
blue
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of `object`, whereas replacing it with a string like "blue" would return the string "blue" instead.

DONE.
