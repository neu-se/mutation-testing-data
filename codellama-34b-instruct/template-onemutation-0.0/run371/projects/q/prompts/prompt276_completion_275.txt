  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.message
```
This would result in different behavior because `error.message` is a string, while `error` is an object. In the original code, `error` is passed as an argument to `self.reject()`, which is likely expecting an object. By replacing it with `error.message`, we are passing a string instead, which could cause issues with the code that handles the rejected promise.
