  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.valueOf(), onFulfilled, onRejected, onProgress
```
This would result in different behavior because `valueOf()` would create a new object and the callbacks would be called on that object instead of the original promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise, onRejected, onFulfilled, onProgress
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the callbacks would be reversed, giving different results in case of both fulfillment and rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise, onFulfilled, onRejected, onProgress
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be calling `onFulfilled` instead of `onRejected`, which would give a different result in case of rejection.

DONE.
