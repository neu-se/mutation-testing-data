  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` returns the square root of a number, while `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number. In the context of the code, `Math.sqrt` would cause the function to return the square root of the absolute value of `b`, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
