 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.pow(E, a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it raises the constant `E` (the base of the natural logarithm) to the power of `a` instead of calculating the exponential function of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(2 * a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the exponential function of twice the value of `a` instead of the original value of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(Math.random())
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the exponential function of a random number instead of the original value of `a`. This would introduce unpredictable results and inconsistencies in the code.

DONE.
