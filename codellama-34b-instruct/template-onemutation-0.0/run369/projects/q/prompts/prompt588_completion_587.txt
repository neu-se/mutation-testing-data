  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("Something went wrong"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise returned by `Q.async` to be rejected, rather than resolved with the value returned by the generator. This would cause any code that is waiting on the promise to be notified of the rejection, rather than the resolution.

DONE.
