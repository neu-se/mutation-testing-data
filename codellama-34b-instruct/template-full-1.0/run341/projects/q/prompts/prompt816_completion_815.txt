  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q().done
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(object)` is transformed into `Q()` which would return an empty promise that is already resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(object).done
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve(object)` creates a resolved promise with the value of `object`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(object).done
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject(object)` creates a rejected promise with the reason of `object`.

DONE.
