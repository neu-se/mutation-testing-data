  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(Δλ)
```
This would result in different behavior because `rad2deg` is the inverse of `deg2rad`, so the result would be in degrees instead of radians.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ * Math.PI / 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the longitude difference by a constant factor, which would change the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ * Math.PI / 180 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the result of the multiplication, which would change the final result.

DONE.
