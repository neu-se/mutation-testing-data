  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a) - Math.sqrt(b)
```
This would result in a different behavior because `Math.pow` is used to calculate the power of two complex numbers, while `Math.sqrt` calculates the square root of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b - a - b
```
This would result in a different behavior because `Math.pow` is used to calculate the power of two complex numbers, while `a * b - a - b` calculates the difference between two numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / b
```
This would result in a different behavior because `Math.pow` is used to calculate the power of two complex numbers, while `a / b` calculates the quotient of two numbers.

DONE.
