Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"at filename:lineNumber"
```
This would result in different behavior because it does not include the column number, which may lead to incorrect parsing of the stack line and potentially cause the function to return undefined instead of the expected file name and line number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because converting the stack line to uppercase would change the format of the string, causing the regular expressions used to extract the file name and line number to fail, resulting in incorrect or missing output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"@filename:lineNumber:columnNumber"
```
This would result in different behavior because the presence of the "@" symbol at the beginning of the string would cause the first regex attempt to fail, as it expects a function name before the "@" symbol, leading to incorrect parsing of the stack line.

DONE.
