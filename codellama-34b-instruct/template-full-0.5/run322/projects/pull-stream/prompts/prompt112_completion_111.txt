  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc + data
```
This would result in different behavior because `acc + data` would be a different value than `acc, data`, which would change the behavior of the `reducer` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc - data
```
This would result in different behavior because `acc - data` would be a different value than `acc, data`, which would change the behavior of the `reducer` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data
```
This would result in different behavior because `data` would be passed as the second argument to the `reducer` function, whereas `acc, data` would pass `acc` as the first argument and `data` as the second argument.

DONE.
