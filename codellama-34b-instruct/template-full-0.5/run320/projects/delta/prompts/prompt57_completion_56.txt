  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops != null && ops.ops.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ops` is an array, while this replacement only checks if the `length` property of `ops.ops` is greater than 0, which may not be the same thing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops != null && typeof ops.ops === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ops` is an array, while this replacement only checks if `ops.ops` is an object, which may not be the same thing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops != null && ops.ops.length > 0 && typeof ops.ops[0] === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ops` is an array, while this replacement only checks if the `length` property of `ops.ops
