  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 b[key], b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the same value for both `a` and `b`, even if they were different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 a[key], null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `null` as the second value, even if `b[key]` was not null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 a[key], undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `undefined` as the second value, even if `b[key]` was defined.

DONE.
