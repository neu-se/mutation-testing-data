  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider any string with length greater than 1 to be truthy, while the original code fragment considers any string as truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider any string with length equal to 0 to be truthy, while the original code fragment considers any string as truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.indexOf('key') !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider any string that contains the word "key" to be truthy, while the original code fragment considers any string as truthy.

DONE.
