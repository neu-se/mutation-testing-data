  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof setImmediate !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `setImmediate` is a function, while this replacement checks if it is not a function. This would cause the `else if` block to be executed, which sets `requestTick` to a function that uses `setTimeout` instead of `setImmediate`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof setImmediate === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `setImmediate` is a function, while this replacement checks if it is not defined. This would cause the `else if` block to be executed, which sets `requestTick` to a function that uses `setTimeout` instead of `setImmediate`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof setImmediate === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `setImmediate` is a function
