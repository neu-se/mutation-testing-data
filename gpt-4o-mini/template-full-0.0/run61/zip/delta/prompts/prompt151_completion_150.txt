Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain + firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly adds `firstLeft` to `firstOther.retain`, which could lead to an incorrect calculation of how many operations to skip from the `other` delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies `firstOther.retain` by 2, which would cause the algorithm to skip twice as many operations as intended, potentially leading to incorrect composition of the deltas.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `firstLeft` directly instead of subtracting it from `firstOther.retain`, which would cause the algorithm to not account for how many operations have already been processed, leading to incorrect delta composition.

DONE.
