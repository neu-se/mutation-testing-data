  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because using void 0 instead of arguments would mean that the resulting promise from calling `Q.denodeify` would always be called with no arguments, regardless of the arguments passed to the original function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using undefined instead of arguments would mean that the resulting promise from calling `Q.denodeify` would always be called with no arguments, regardless of the arguments passed to the original function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because using null instead of arguments would mean that the resulting promise from calling `Q.denodeify` would always be called with a single null argument, regardless of the arguments passed to the original function.

DONE.
