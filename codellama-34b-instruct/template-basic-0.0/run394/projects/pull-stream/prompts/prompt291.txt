Consider the following code fragment:
```
'use strict'

var unique = require('./unique')

//passes an item through when you see it for the second time.
module.exports = function nonUnique (field) {
  return unique(field, <PLACEHOLDER>)
}

```

Please provide a code fragment that PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with.  

Provide your answer as a fenced code block containing a single line of code,
using the following template:

The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```

Please conclude your response with "DONE."
