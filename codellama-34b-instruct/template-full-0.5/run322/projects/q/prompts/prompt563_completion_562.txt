  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception
```
This would result in different behavior because the `exception` object would be returned instead of the `exception.value` property, which could cause issues in the code that uses the returned value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be returned instead of the `exception.value` property, which could cause issues in the code that uses the returned value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be returned instead of the `exception.value` property, which could cause issues in the code that uses the returned value.

DONE.
