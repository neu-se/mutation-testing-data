Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.catch
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only handle rejected promises instead of both fulfilled and rejected promises, potentially leading to unhandled fulfilled promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would effectively ignore both fulfillment and rejection handlers, causing the promise to remain unresolved without any action taken on either outcome.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.finally
```
This would result in different behavior because it would execute the callback regardless of whether the promise was fulfilled or rejected, which is not the intended behavior of inspecting the promise's state.

DONE.
