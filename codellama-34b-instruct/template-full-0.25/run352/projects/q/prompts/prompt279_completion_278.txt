  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` is now `2`, which means the first argument will be excluded from the resulting array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument to `array_slice` is now `1`, which means only the first argument will be included in the resulting array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument to `array_slice` is now `2`, which means only the second argument will be included in the resulting array.

DONE.
