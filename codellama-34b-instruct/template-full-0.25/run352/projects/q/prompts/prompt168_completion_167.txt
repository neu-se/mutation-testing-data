  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isInternalFrame(line) && line
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not filter out internal frames, which could cause the stack trace to become too long.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNodeFrame(line) && line
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not filter out Node frames, which could cause the stack trace to become too long.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not filter out any frames, which could cause the stack trace to become too long.

DONE.
