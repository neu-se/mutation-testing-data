  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deprecate2
```
This would result in different behavior because `deprecate2` is not a valid method, which would cause an error when calling `allResolved()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deprecate('New method name')
```
This would result in different behavior because `deprecate('New method name')` would log a warning message to the console with the new method name, but would still return the correct result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
not recommended
```
This would result in different behavior because `not recommended` is not a valid method, which would cause an error when calling `allResolved()`.

DONE.
