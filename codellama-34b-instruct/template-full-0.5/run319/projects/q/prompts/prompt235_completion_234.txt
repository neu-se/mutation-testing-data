  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first argument to the `promiseDispatch` method, whereas the original code fragment passes all arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass all arguments except the first one to the `promiseDispatch` method, whereas the original code fragment passes all arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0] + args[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a concatenation of the first two arguments to the `promiseDispatch` method, whereas the original code fragment passes all arguments.

DONE.
