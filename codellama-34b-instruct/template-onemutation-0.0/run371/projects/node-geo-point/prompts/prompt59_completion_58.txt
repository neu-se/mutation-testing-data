  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `φ1` variable is the latitude of the first point, while `φ2` is the latitude of the second point. Using `φ1` instead of `φ2` would cause the bearing calculation to use the latitude of the first point instead of the second point, which would result in an incorrect bearing value.

DONE.
