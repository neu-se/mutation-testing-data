  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeTimezone
```
This would result in different behavior because `memoizeCountry` and `memoizeTimezone` are different functions with different purposes. `memoizeCountry` is used to memoize the `getCountry` function, while `memoizeTimezone` is used to memoize the `getTimezone` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeTimezone(timezones[name])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would memoize the timezone object instead of the country object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeTimezone(timezones[name], options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would memoize the timezone object with the `options` argument, which could affect the behavior of the `getTimezone` function.

DONE.
