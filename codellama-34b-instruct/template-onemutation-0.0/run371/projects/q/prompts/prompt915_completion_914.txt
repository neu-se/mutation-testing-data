  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is a function that returns a new deferred object, but `defer(null)` would return a new deferred object with a null value, which would cause the promise to be resolved with a null value instead of the expected value.
