 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the onRejected function is replaced with an empty function, which means rejected promises will not be handled and the error will propagate silently, potentially causing unexpected behavior in other parts of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onRejected = function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the onRejected function is overwritten, which means rejected promises will not be handled and the error will propagate silently, potentially causing unexpected behavior in other parts of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function onRejected() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the onRejected function is redefined in the same scope, which means rejected promises will not be handled and the error will propagate silently, potentially causing unexpected behavior in other parts of the code.

DONE.
