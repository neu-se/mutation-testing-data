  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would decrement `i` instead of incrementing it, causing the loop to run indefinitely or until an error is thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip over every other element in the array, potentially causing the loop to terminate prematurely or to access out-of-bounds indices.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would reset `i` to 0 on each iteration, causing the loop to run indefinitely or until an error is thrown.

DONE.
