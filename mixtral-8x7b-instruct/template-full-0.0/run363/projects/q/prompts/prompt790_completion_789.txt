 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method expects a function as the second argument, and null is not a function. This would cause an exception to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
42
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method expects a function as the second argument, and an integer is not a function. This would cause an exception to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return 42; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method expects a function that takes a single argument (the resolved value of the promise) and returns a value. The function provided here always returns 42, regardless of the input, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
