  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"UTC"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the "UTC" timezone, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"GMT"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the "GMT" timezone, regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"EST"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the "EST" timezone, regardless of the input.

DONE.
