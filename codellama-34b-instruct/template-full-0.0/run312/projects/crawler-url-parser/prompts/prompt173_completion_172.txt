  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.error
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.error` would log the message to the console with a higher level of severity, indicating that the message is an error, whereas `console.log` would log the message with a lower level of severity, indicating that the message is informational.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.warn
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.warn` would log the message to the console with a higher level of severity than `console.log`, indicating that the message is a warning.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.info
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.info` would log the message to the console with a lower level of severity than `console.log`, indicating that the message is informational.

DONE.
