  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `abortCb`, which is a function that takes three arguments, but the replacement code fragment only takes two arguments. This would cause the `onAbort` callback to be ignored, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the program.

DONE.
