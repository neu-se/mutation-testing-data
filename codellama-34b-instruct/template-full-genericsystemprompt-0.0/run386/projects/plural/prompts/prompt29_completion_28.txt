  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/thesis|crisis/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'is' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the word "es" instead of "is" in the returned string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
