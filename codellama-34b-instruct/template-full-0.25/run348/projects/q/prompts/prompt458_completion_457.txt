  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.then()` would create a new promise that resolves with the original promise's fulfillment value or rejection reason, whereas `promise` would simply return the original promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.catch()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.catch()` would create a new promise that resolves with the original promise's fulfillment value or rejection reason, whereas `promise` would simply return the original promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.finally()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.finally()` would create a new promise that resolves with the original promise's fulfillment value or rejection reason, whereas `promise` would simply return the original promise.

DONE.
