  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.message
```
This would result in different behavior because the `message` property of the `exception` object is a string, whereas `exception` is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `toString()` method of the `exception` object returns a string representation of the object, whereas `exception` is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stack` property of the `exception` object is a string that represents the stack trace at the point where the exception was thrown, whereas `exception` is an object.

DONE.
