  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(name).name
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the name of the timezone instead of the timezone object, which is what the original code fragment returns.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(name).timezones
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the timezones property of the timezone object instead of the timezone object itself, which is what the original code fragment returns.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(name).countries
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the countries property of the timezone object instead of the timezone object itself, which is what the original code fragment returns.

DONE.
