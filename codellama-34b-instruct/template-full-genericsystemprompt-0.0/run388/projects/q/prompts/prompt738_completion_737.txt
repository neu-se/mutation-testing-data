  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `Q.resolve` would cause it to be fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer` would create a new deferred object, whereas `Q.resolve` would fulfill the promise with the given value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when` would create a new promise that is resolved with the given value, whereas `Q.resolve` would fulfill the promise with the given value.

DONE.
