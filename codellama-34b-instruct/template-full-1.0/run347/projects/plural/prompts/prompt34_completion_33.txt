  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the same word instead of the plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the plural form instead of the same word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1 - w.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a substring of the original word instead of the plural form.

DONE.
