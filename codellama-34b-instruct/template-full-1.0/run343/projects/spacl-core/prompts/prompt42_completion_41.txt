  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `part.length > 1` condition would always evaluate to `true`, even if `part` is an empty string. In the original code, the condition is `part.length > 0`, which would catch both non-empty strings and empty strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the new condition `part.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/) !== null` checks if `part` matches the regular expression `/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/`, which matches any string that only contains alphanumeric characters, underscores, forward slashes, and tildes. In the original code, the condition is `spec.match(version === '1
