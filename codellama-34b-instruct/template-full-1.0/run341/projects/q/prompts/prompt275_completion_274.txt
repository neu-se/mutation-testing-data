  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.reject(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because self.reject() is not the same as reject() and it would pass the error to the reject function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the error to the reject function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(error)
```
This would result in different behavior since the error would be resolved as a success instead of rejected as an error.

DONE.
