  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the comparison from absolute value to relative value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(a) <= Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the comparison from strict inequality to non-strict inequality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(a) > Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the comparison from less than to greater than.

DONE.
