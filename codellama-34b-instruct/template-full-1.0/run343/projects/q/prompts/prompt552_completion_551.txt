  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` returns a rejected promise, whereas `Q.when` returns a promise for the fulfilled value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.allSettled
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.allSettled` returns a promise for the array of results, whereas `Q.when` returns a promise for the value of the first promise that fulfills.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.race
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.race` returns a promise for the value of the first promise that fulfills or rejects, whereas `Q.when` returns a promise for the value of the first promise that fulfills.

DONE.
