  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spaces + 1
```
This change will cause the `stringify` function to add an extra space to the output, which may cause issues with the JSON parsing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spaces - 1
```
This change will cause the `stringify` function to remove a space from the output, which may also cause issues with the JSON parsing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spaces * 2
```
This change will cause the `stringify` function to double the number of spaces in the output, which may also cause issues with the JSON parsing.

DONE.
