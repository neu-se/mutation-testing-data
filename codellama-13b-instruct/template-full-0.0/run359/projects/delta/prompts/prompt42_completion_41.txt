  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.fromCharCode(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `String.fromCharCode` function returns an empty string when passed a null character, whereas the original code fragment returns a string containing a null character. This could potentially cause issues in the code that uses the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function, as it relies on the `typeof` operator to determine the type of the `a` and `b` parameters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.fromCharCode(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `String.fromCharCode` function returns a string containing a single character, whereas the original code fragment returns a string containing a null character. This could potentially cause issues in the code that uses the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function, as it relies on the `typeof` operator to determine the type of the `a` and `b` parameters.
