  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the length of the `promises` array is equal to 0, while this replacement checks if the length is less than 0, which is always false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the length of the `promises` array is equal to 0, while this replacement checks if the length is greater than 0, which is always true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the length of the `promises` array is equal to 0, while this replacement checks if the length is equal to 1, which is always false if the array is empty.

DONE.
