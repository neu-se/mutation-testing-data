  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `makeNodeResolver()` on the wrong `this` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(deferred.makeNodeResolver())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the `makeNodeResolver()` function to a string, which would cause the `nsend()` method to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
eval("deferred.makeNodeResolver()")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would execute the `makeNodeResolver()` function in the global scope, which would cause the `nsend()` method to fail.

DONE.
