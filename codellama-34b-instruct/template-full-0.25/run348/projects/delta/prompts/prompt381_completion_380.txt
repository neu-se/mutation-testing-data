  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to advance to the next operation, which may not be intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to return the next operation without advancing the iterator, which may not be intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to return the type of the next operation without advancing the iterator, which may not be intended.

DONE.
