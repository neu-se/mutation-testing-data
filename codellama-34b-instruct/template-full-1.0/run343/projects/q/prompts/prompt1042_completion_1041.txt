  Certainly! Here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different behavior than the original code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `.get()`, which retrieves the value of a property, while the mutated code uses `.resolve`, which sets the value of a property. This could cause the function to behave differently if the property is being used in a different way in the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `.get()`, which retrieves the value of a property, while the mutated code uses `.reject`, which sets the value of a property to an error. This could cause the function to behave differently if the property is being used in a different way in the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.then
```
