  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` checks if a value is a finite number, whereas `isNaN` checks if a value is Not a Number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isInfinity
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinity` checks if a value is Infinity, whereas `isNaN` checks if a value is Not a Number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNaN(this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` checks if a value is Not a Number, but `this['im']` is the imaginary part of the complex number, which may not be a number.

DONE.
