  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the operation `callback.apply(<PLACEHOLDER>, args)` would fail with a `TypeError` if `self` is null or undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the operation `callback.apply(<PLACEHOLDER>, args)` would pass 0 as the `this` value to the `callback` function, which may result in unintended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the operation `callback.apply(<PLACEHOLDER>, args)` would pass an empty object as the `this` value to the `callback` function, which may result in unintended behavior.

DONE.
