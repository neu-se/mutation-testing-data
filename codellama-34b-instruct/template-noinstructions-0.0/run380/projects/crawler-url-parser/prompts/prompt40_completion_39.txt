  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `host` property is `null` and the `baseUrlStr` is not `null`, while this new code fragment only checks if the `host` property is `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `host` property is `null` and the `baseUrlStr` is not `null`, while this new code fragment only checks if the `baseUrlStr` is `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host == null && baseUrlStr == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `host` property is `null` and the `baseUrlStr` is not `null`, while this new code fragment checks if both the `host` property and the `baseUrlStr`
