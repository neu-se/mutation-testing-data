  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) {
    return promise.inspect();
}, function (reason) {
    throw reason;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the reason from the original promise, rather than the resolved value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) {
    return promise.inspect();
}, function (reason) {
    return reason;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the reason from the original promise, rather than being rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) {
    return promise.inspect();
}, function (reason) {
    return promise.inspect();
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the result of `promise.inspect()`,
