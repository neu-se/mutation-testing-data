  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the value of the `value` variable, while this replacement would result in the promise being resolved with a value of `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the value of the `value` variable, while this replacement would result in the promise being resolved with a value of `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the value of the `value` variable, while this replacement would result in the promise being resolved with a value of `0`.

DONE.
