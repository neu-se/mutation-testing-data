  No problem; here are three options:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to move to the next position, which may not be the desired behavior in this situation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.previous
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to move to the previous position, which may not be the desired behavior in this situation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the other iterator to move to the next position, which may not be the desired behavior in this situation.

DONE.
