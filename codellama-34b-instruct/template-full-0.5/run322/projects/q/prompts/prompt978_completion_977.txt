  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushes the node resolver to the `nodeArgs` array, which is used to call the `post` method on the `this` object. However, the replaced code pushes the node resolver to the `nodeArgs` array, which is not used in the `post` method call. This would cause the `post` method to be called with the wrong arguments, resulting in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.unshift(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushes the node resolver to the end of the `nodeArgs` array, which is used to call the `post` method on the `this` object. However, the replaced code unshifts the node resolver to the beginning of the `nodeArgs` array, which would cause the `post` method to be called with the wrong arguments, resulting in different behavior
