  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `other.ops.length` would be a negative number, which would be an invalid length for an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `other.ops.length` would be a non-zero number, which would be an invalid length for an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `other.ops.length` would be a single number, which would be an invalid length for an array.

DONE.
