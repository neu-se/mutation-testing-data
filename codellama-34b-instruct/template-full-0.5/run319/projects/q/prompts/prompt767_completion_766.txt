  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `noop` function is not defined, so the code would throw a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (err) { throw err; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onRejected` function would throw an error, causing the promise to be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (err) { return err; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onRejected` function would return the error, causing the promise to be fulfilled with the error value.

DONE.
