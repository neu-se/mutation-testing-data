 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|[^aeiou]ch$|s$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a negative character class to the `ch` part of the regular expression, which would exclude words ending in `eCH` or `iCH` from being matched.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the global flag `g` to the regular expression, which would make it match all occurrences of the pattern in the input string instead of stopping after the first match.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/.test
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `i` flag with the `test` method, which would make the regular expression case-sensitive and only check if the pattern matches the input string, but not replace it.
