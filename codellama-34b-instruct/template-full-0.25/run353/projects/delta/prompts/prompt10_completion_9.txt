  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a && b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than the `==` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(a && b) == undefined`, which would always be false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a || b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has a lower precedence than the `==` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `a == (undefined || b)`, which would always be true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a != b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!=` operator has a higher precedence than the `==` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(a != b) == undefined`, which would always be false.

DONE.
