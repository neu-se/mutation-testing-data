  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trackUnhandledRejections` variable is set to `true` in the original code, so the `if` statement would always be executed. In the mutated code, the `if` statement would only be executed if `trackUnhandledRejections` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trackUnhandledRejections` variable is set to `true` in the original code, so the `if` statement would always be executed. In the mutated code, the `if` statement would only be executed if `trackUnhandledRejections` is not `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trackUnhandledRejections` variable is set to `true`
