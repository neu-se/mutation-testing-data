  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, while the `===` operator checks for strict equality. In this case, the `query` method would always return `null` if the `res` variable is not strictly equal to `true`, even if it is equal to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, while the `===` operator checks for strict equality. In this case, the `query` method would always return `null` if the `res` variable is not strictly equal to `false`, even if it is equal to `false`.
