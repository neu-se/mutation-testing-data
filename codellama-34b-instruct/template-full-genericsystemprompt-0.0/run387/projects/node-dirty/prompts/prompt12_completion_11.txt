  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the key would be incremented by 1, which would cause the code to store the value at the wrong key in the cache.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the key would be decremented by 1, which would cause the code to store the value at the wrong key in the cache.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the key would be multiplied by 2, which would cause the code to store the value at the wrong key in the cache.

DONE.
