  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (err === true) nextStream(null)
```
This change will cause the `nextStream` function to be called with `null` as an argument, which is not the intended behavior. The original code fragment checks if `err` is equal to `true`, and if so, it calls `nextStream` with `err` as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (err === true) nextStream(err)
```
This change will cause the `nextStream` function to be called with `err` as an argument, which is not the intended behavior. The original code fragment checks if `err` is equal to `true`, and if so, it calls `nextStream` with `null` as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (err === true) nextStream(undefined)
```
This change will cause the `nextStream` function to be called with `undefined` as an argument, which is not the intended behavior
