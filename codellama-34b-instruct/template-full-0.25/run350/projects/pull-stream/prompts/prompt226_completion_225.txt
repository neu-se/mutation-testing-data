  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return test(data) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is missing, which would cause the function to return the opposite result of what it is supposed to.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return test(data) + 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different value than what it is supposed to, which would cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return test(data) * 2 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different value than what it is supposed to, which would cause the test to fail.

DONE.
