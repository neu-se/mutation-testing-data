Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
''
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty string would always be found in any string, causing the `isDynamicPattern` function to incorrectly identify all patterns as dynamic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
GLOBSTAR
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isDynamicPattern` function to return true for patterns containing the globstar character, even if they are not actually dynamic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
ESCAPE_SYMBOL + ESCAPE_SYMBOL
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isDynamicPattern` function to return true for patterns containing double escape symbols, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
