  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof options !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `options` argument is a string, while the new code fragment checks if it is not a string. This change would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `options` is a string, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the `readFileSync` function.

DONE.
