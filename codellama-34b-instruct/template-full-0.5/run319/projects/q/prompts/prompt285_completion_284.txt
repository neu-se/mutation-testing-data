  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the promise is resolved with the value of `value`, but in this modified version, the promise is resolved with `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the promise is resolved with the value of `value`, but in this modified version, the promise is resolved with `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the promise is resolved with the value of `value`, but in this modified version, the promise is resolved with `0`.

DONE.
