  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This would result in different behavior because `x` is not a function and would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(flush)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would log the `flush` function to the console instead of executing it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would bind the `flush` function to a different `this` context, potentially altering its behavior.

DONE.
