  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `verb` would be incremented, potentially causing a different property to be accessed on the `generator` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `result.value` would be `null`, causing a different return value for the `Q` promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("foo")
```
This would result in different behavior because an error would be thrown, potentially causing the `Q` promise to reject.

DONE.
