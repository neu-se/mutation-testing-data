  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT operator, which returns the opposite boolean value of its operand. In this case, if `test` is a function, it would return the opposite boolean value of the function's return value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test()
```
This would result in different behavior because `test()` is a function call, which would execute the function and return its return value. In this case, if `test` is a function, it would return the function's return value, which may be different from the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `test.call(this)` is a function call with a specific context, which would execute the function with the context of the current object. In this case, if `test` is a function, it would return the function's return value,
