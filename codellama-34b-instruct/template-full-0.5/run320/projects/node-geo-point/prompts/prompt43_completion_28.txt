  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because the `point1Rad` variable is not defined in the code snippet provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `point2Rad` variable is being multiplied by 2, which would change the final result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad - point1Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because the `point2Rad` variable is being subtracted from the `point1Rad` variable, which would change the final result of the calculation.

DONE.
