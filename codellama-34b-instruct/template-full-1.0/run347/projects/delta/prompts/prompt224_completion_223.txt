  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
들inese:_none: of
```
This would result in different behavior because the `lodash` library is being referenced as `들inese` instead of `lodash`, which would cause a type error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bidden:_none: of
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bitten` library is being referenced as `bidden`, which is a typo and would cause a type error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
estica:_none: of
```
This would result in different behavior because the ` университета ` library is being referenced as `estica`, which is a misspelling and would cause a type error.

DONE.
