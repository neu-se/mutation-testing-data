  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read(abort, function(err) {
  cb(err, null)
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only passed the `err` object to the `cb` function, while this new fragment passes both `err` and `null` as arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read(abort, function(err) {
  cb(err, undefined)
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only passed the `err` object to the `cb` function, while this new fragment passes both `err` and `undefined` as arguments.
