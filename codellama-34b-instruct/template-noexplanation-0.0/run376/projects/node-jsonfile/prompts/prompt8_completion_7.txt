  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data = data.replace(/^\ufeff/, '')
```
This code fragment replaces the Unicode Byte Order Mark (BOM) at the beginning of the data string with an empty string. The BOM is a non-printing character that can be used to indicate the endianness of a file. In this case, the code is removing the BOM from the data string before parsing it as JSON.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data = data.replace(/^\ufeff/, '').trim()
```
This code fragment is similar to the previous option, but it also trims any whitespace characters from the beginning and end of the data string before parsing it as JSON.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data = data.replace(/^\ufeff/, '').replace(/\s+$/, '')
```
This code fragment is similar to the previous option, but it uses a regular expression to remove any whitespace characters from the beginning and end of the data string, rather than just
