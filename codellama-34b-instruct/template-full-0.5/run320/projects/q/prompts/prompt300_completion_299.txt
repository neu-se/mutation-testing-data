  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all([this, that])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all` returns a promise that is fulfilled when all of the promises in the input array are fulfilled, whereas `Q(this).join(that)` returns a promise that is fulfilled when `this` and `that` are the same value, but otherwise rejects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.race([this, that])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.race` returns a promise that is fulfilled when any of the promises in the input array are fulfilled, whereas `Q(this).join(that)` returns a promise that is fulfilled when `this` and `that` are the same value, but otherwise rejects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(this).then(function (value) {
    return Q(that).then(function (otherValue) {
        if (value === otherValue)
