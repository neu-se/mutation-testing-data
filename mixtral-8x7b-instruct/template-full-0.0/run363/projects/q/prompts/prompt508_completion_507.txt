 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
value.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` changes the value of `this` in the function being called, while `apply` uses an array of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
value.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with the `this` value and arguments specified, while `apply` invokes the function with the provided `this` value and arguments provided as an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Function.prototype.apply.call(value, thisp, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly calls the `apply` method of the `Function` prototype on the `value` object, instead of using the `apply` method of the `value` object directly.

DONE.
