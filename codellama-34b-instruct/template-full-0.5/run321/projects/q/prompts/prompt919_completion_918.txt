  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver` is a function that returns a node-style callback, while `deferred.resolve` is a function that resolves a promise with a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is a function that rejects a promise with a reason, while `deferred.makeNodeResolver` is a function that returns a node-style callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` is a function that notifies the progress of a promise, while `deferred.makeNodeResolver` is a function that returns a node-style callback.

DONE.
