Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._loadData
```
This would result in different behavior because it refers to a non-existent method `_loadData`, which would cause a runtime error when trying to call it, instead of correctly invoking the `_load` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._load()
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces an additional set of parentheses, which would invoke the `_load` method immediately instead of just referencing it, potentially leading to unexpected behavior if the context of the call is not appropriate.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._load = null
```
This would result in different behavior because it assigns `null` to the `_load` method, effectively removing the functionality to load data, which would lead to errors when the code attempts to call `_load` later on.

DONE.
