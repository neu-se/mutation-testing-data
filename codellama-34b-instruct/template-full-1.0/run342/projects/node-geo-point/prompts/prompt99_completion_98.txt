  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x, y
```
This would result in different behavior because the `x` and `y` variables are swapped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y * x
```
This would result in different behavior because the `y` and `x` values are multiplied instead of being used as separate arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + y
```
This would result in different behavior because the `x` and `y` values are added together instead of being used as separate arguments.

DONE.
