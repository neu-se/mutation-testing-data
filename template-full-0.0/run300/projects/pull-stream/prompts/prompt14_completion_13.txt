  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1; i <= length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one more time than the original code, potentially causing the `args` array to be populated with an extra `undefined` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i < length - 1; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one fewer time than the original code, potentially causing the `args` array to be populated with one fewer value than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i < length; i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate over every other element in the `arguments` array, potentially causing the `args` array to be populated with the wrong values.

DONE.
