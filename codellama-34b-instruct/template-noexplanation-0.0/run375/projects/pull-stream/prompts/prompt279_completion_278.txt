  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.foo
```
This change will cause the `map` function to return a different value than the original code, which could potentially cause issues in the code that uses the `map` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.bar
```
This change will also cause the `map` function to return a different value than the original code, and could potentially cause issues in the code that uses the `map` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.baz
```
This change will cause the `map` function to return a different value than the original code, and could potentially cause issues in the code that uses the `map` function.

DONE.
