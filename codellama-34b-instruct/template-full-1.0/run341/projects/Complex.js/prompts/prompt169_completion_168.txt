  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] !== 0 && z['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `isZero` method is called on `this` and `z`, which are both objects of type `Complex`. In the modified code, the `re` property is accessed directly and compared to zero, which may not be equivalent to the `isZero` method's implementation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `isInfinite` method is called on `z`, which is an object of type `Complex`. In the modified code, the `im` property is accessed directly and compared to zero, which may not be equivalent to the `isInfinite` method's implementation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code
