  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter.next()` method to be called with a different argument, which could potentially return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter.next()` method to be called with a different argument, which could potentially return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter.next()` method to be called with a different argument, which could potentially return a different value.

DONE.
