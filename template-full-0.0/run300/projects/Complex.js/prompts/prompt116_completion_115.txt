  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the first argument passed to the `Complex` constructor, regardless of whether it is a valid complex number or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the second argument passed to the `Complex` constructor, regardless of whether it is a valid complex number or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the sum of the first and second arguments passed to the `Complex` constructor, regardless of whether they are valid complex numbers or not.

DONE.
