Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.unshift(args);
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the `args` to the beginning of the `messages` array instead of the end, which would change the order in which messages are processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.push(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes a `null` value into the `messages` array instead of the actual `args`, which would lead to incorrect or missing data when processing the messages.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.push(args[0]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it only pushes the first element of `args` into the `messages` array, potentially losing other important arguments that were meant to be dispatched.

DONE.
