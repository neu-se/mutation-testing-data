  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` is a method that removes and replaces elements in an array, whereas `slice` is a method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array. In this case, the `concat` method is expecting an array of operations, but if `splice` is used instead of `slice`, it will return a new array with the same elements as `other.ops`, but with some of the elements potentially removed or replaced. This could cause the `concat` method to behave unexpectedly and produce incorrect results.

DONE.
