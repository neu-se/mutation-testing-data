  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `onRejected` would be called for progress notifications instead of `onProgress`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
noop
```
This would result in different behavior because `noop` would be called for progress notifications instead of `onProgress`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (progress) {
    deferred.notify({
        index: index,
        value: progress
    });
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be called for progress notifications instead of `onProgress`.

DONE.
