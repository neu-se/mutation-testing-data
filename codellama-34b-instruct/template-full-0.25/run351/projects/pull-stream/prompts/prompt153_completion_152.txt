  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `abort` variable, causing the `abortCb` function to be called with a different value than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator returns the first truthy value, so if `abort` is falsy, the `abortCb` function will be called with `true` instead of `abort`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator returns the first falsy value, so if `abort` is truthy, the `abortCb` function will be called with `false` instead of `abort`.

DONE.
