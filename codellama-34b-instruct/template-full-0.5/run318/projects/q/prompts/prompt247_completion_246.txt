  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first character of the stack trace, which could potentially change the line number that is displayed in the stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.substring(0, 10)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only include the first 10 characters of the stack trace, which could potentially change the line number that is displayed in the stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.split("\n")[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only include the second line of the stack trace, which could potentially change the line number that is displayed in the stack trace.

DONE.
