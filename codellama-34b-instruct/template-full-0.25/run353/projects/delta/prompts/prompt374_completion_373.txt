  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.next()` would return the next operation in the iterator, whereas `thisIter.next` would return the `next` method itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.peek()` would return the next operation in the iterator without advancing the iterator, whereas `thisIter.next` would return the `next` method itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.hasNext()` would return a boolean indicating whether there are more operations in the iterator, whereas `thisIter.next` would return the `next` method itself.

DONE.
