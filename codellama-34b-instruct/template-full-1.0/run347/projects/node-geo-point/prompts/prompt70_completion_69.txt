  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(θ + Math.PI) % (2 * Math.PI)
```
This would result in different behavior because the modulo operation would return different values for the same input angles.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(θ + Math.PI / 2) % Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the modulo operation would return different values for the same input angles.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(θ + Math.PI / 4) % (2 * Math.PI)
```
This would result in different behavior because the modulo operation would return different values for the same input angles.

DONE.
