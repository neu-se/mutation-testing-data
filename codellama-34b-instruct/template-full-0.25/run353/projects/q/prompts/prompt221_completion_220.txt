  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_create(Promise.prototype)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise with the `Promise.prototype` as its prototype, which is not the same as the original code that used `object_create` with no arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_create(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise with a null prototype, which is not the same as the original code that used `object_create` with `Promise.prototype` as its prototype.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that is already resolved, which is not the same as the original code that created a new promise that was not yet resolved.

DONE.
