  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` will always return a rejected promise, whereas `Q.when` will return a promise that is resolved with the value of the first argument if it is a promise, or a promise that is resolved with the first argument if it is not a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all` will return a promise that is resolved with an array of values if all of the promises in the array are resolved, or rejected with the reason of the first promise that is rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.race
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.race` will return a promise that is resolved with the value of the first promise in the array that is resolved, or rejected with the reason of the first promise that is rejected.

DONE.
