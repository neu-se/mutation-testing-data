  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return
```
This would result in different behavior because the `return` statement would cause the function to exit immediately, without executing any further code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throw` statement would cause an error to be thrown, which would be caught by the `try` block and passed to the `done` callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(null, function (end, data) {
  if (end) {
    loop = false
    if (done) done(end === true ? null : end)
    else if (end && end !== true) {
      console.warn(doneLackingErr)
      throw end
    }
  }
  else if (op && false === op(data) || abort) {
    loop = false
    read(abort || true, done || function () {})
  }
