  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clearInterval(timeoutId)
```
This would result in different behavior because `clearInterval` is used to stop the execution of a function at specified intervals, while `clearTimeout` is used to stop the execution of a function after a specified number of milliseconds.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
func()
```
This would result in different behavior because `func` is a user-defined function that may have a different implementation than `clearTimeout`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.clear()
```
This would result in different behavior because `clear` is not a method of the Promise class, and may not have the same effect as `clearTimeout`.

DONE.
