  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const key in a) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the properties of the `a` object, but it would not check if the property is defined in the `b` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const key in b) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the properties of the `b` object, but it would not check if the property is defined in the `a` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const key in a || b) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the properties of the `a` object if it exists, or the `b` object if it doesn't, but it would not check if the property is defined in both objects.

DONE.
