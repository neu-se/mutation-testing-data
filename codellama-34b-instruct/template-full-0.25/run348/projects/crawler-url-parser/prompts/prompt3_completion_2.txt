  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `currentUrlStr` is undefined, while this new code fragment checks if it is null. If `currentUrlStr` is null, the new code fragment will return null, while the original code fragment would continue executing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `currentUrlStr` is undefined, while this new code fragment checks if it is an empty string. If `currentUrlStr` is an empty string, the new code fragment will return null, while the original code fragment would continue executing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `currentUrlStr` is undefined, while this new code fragment checks if its length is 0. If `currentUrlStr` has a length of
