  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.compose
```
This would result in different behavior because `AttributeMap.compose` is a different function from `AttributeMap.invert`, and it may not have the same behavior when called with the same arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.transform
```
This would result in different behavior because `AttributeMap.transform` is a different function from `AttributeMap.invert`, and it may not have the same behavior when called with the same arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.invert
```
This would result in different behavior because `AttributeMap.invert` is a different function from `AttributeMap.invert`, and it may not have the same behavior when called with the same arguments.

DONE.
