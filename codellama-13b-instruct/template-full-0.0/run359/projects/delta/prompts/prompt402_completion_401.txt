  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType === Object.keys(otherData)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `embedType` is equal to the first key of the `otherData` object, while the buggy code fragment checks if the `embedType` is equal to the `Object.keys(otherData)[0]` expression, which is always `true`. This would cause the `transform` method to always retain the `otherData` object, regardless of the `priority` flag.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType === Object.keys(thisData)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `embedType` is equal to the first key of the `otherData` object, while the buggy code fragment checks if the `embedType` is equal to the `Object.keys(thisData)[0]` expression, which is always `true`. This would cause the `transform` method to always retain the `thisData` object, regardless of
