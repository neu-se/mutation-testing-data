  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked for `null` or `undefined` before calling the `cb` function. If the PLACEHOLDER is replaced with `undefined`, the function may not be called even if the input stream is `null` or `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked for `null` or `undefined` before calling the `cb` function. If the PLACEHOLDER is replaced with `false`, the function may still be called even if the input stream is `null` or `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked for `null` or `undefined` before calling the `cb` function. If the PLACEHOLDER is replaced with an error object, the function may not be called even if the input stream is `null`
