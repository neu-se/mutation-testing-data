  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{
  return null;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns an empty object, while this new code fragment returns null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{
  return undefined;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns an empty object, while this new code fragment returns undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{
  return {};
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns an empty object, while this new code fragment returns a new empty object.

DONE.
