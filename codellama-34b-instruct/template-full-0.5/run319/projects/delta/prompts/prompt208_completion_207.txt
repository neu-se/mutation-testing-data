  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.chop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `chop()` is a method that removes leading and trailing empty operations from a delta, but it does not return a value, so the code would not compile.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat()` is a method that concatenates two deltas, but it does not return a value, so the code would not compile.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.compose()
```
This would result in different behavior because `compose()` is a method that composes two deltas, but it does not return a value, so the code would not compile.

DONE.
