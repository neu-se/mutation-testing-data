  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.post
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch` is a function that dispatches an event, while `this.post` is a property that returns a URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch` is a function that dispatches an event, while `this.get` is a function that retrieves a resource from a URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch` is a function that dispatches an event, while `this.set` is a function that sets the value of a property.

DONE.
