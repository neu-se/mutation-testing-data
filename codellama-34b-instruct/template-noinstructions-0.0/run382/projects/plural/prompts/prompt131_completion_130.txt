  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].test(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` method is called on the regular expression object directly, rather than on the `type` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type(rule[0]) === 'RegExp' && rule[0].test(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` method is called on the regular expression object directly, rather than on the `type` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type(rule[0]) === 'RegExp' && rule[0].test(word)

DONE.
