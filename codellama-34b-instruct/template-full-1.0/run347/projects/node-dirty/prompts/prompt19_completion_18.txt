  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key: cbs
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the order of the arguments passed to the `_queue.set()` method, which could potentially cause the method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs: key
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the data type of the `cbs` variable, which could potentially cause the method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs: key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the `key` variable, which could potentially cause the method to behave differently.

DONE.
