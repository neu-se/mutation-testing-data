  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__maximumStackCounter__"
```
This would result in different behavior because the new property name is different from the original one, and it would not be able to access the same value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__stackCounter__"
```
This would result in different behavior because the new property name is different from the original one, and it would not be able to access the same value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__stackCounter__" + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the new property name is different from the original one, and it would not be able to access the same value.

DONE.
