  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
createWriteStream(dest, { flags: 'w' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flags` option is set to `'w'` instead of `'a'`, which means that the file will be overwritten instead of appended to.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
createWriteStream(dest, { encoding: 'utf8' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `encoding` option is set to `'utf8'` instead of `'binary'`, which means that the file will be written in UTF-8 encoding instead of binary.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
createWriteStream(dest, { mode: '0666' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `mode` option is set to `'0666'` instead of `'0644'`, which means that the file will have read and write permissions for the owner, and read permissions for group and others instead of read and write permissions
