  Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
args.concat(array_slice(arguments, 2))
```
This would result in different behavior because it omits the first argument of the `array_slice()` method, which would result in a different array being passed to the `dispatch()` method.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it excludes the first and last arguments of the `arguments` object, which would result in a different array being passed to the `dispatch()` method.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
args.reduce(function(acc, arg) {
    acc.push(arg);
    return acc;
}, [])
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `.reduce()` instead of `.concat()` and `.slice()` to create a new array with all the arguments, which would result in a different array being passed to the `dispatch()` method.
