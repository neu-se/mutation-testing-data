  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.notOk()
```
This would result in different behavior because "notOk" is not a valid method of the "ses" object, so it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ses.notOk()
```
This would result in different behavior because "notOk" is not a valid method of the "ses" object, so it would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.ok()
```
This would result in different behavior because "ok" is a valid method of the "ses" object, but it would always return "true", which would change the behavior of the "if" statement to always execute the branch that is currently only executed if "ses.ok()" returns "false".

DONE.
