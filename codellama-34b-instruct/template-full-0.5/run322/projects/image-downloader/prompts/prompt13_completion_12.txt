  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodeURI
```
This would result in different behavior because `decodeURI` only decodes the URI component, whereas `decodeURIComponent` decodes both the URI component and the query string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodeURIComponent(pathname)
```
This would result in different behavior because `decodeURIComponent` is called on the `pathname` variable, which is not defined in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodeURIComponent(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because `decodeURIComponent` is called on the `options.dest` variable, which is not defined in the original code.

DONE.
