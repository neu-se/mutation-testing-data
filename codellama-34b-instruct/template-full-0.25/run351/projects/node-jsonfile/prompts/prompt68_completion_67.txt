  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\u0000/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is now matching a null character instead of a byte order mark (BOM), which could lead to unexpected results when parsing JSON data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\u0000/g, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is now matching a null character globally instead of just once, which could lead to unexpected results when parsing JSON data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\u0000/g, ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is now matching a null character globally and replacing it with a space character, which could lead to unexpected results when parsing JSON data.

DONE.
