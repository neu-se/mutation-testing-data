  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^a-z0-9\:\/\?\#\[\]\@\!\$\&\'\(\)\*\+\,\;\=\.\-\_\~\%]/i.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression now includes additional characters that were not present in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
![isNaN()]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN()` function checks for the presence of the `NAN` value, which would not be caught by the regular expression in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fasstst()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fasstst()` function is not defined in the original code fragment, and would therefore throw an error.

DONE.
