  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/appendix|index/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ices' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a regular expression to match the words "appendix" and "index" and then applies the pluralization rule to them, while this code fragment uses a different regular expression to match the same words and applies a different pluralization rule to them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/appendix|index/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'es' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a regular expression to match the words "appendix" and "index" and then applies the pluralization rule to them, while this code fragment uses a different regular expression to match the same words and applies a different pluralization rule to them.
