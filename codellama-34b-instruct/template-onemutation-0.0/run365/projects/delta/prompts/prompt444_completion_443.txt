  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset + length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `offset` and `length` variables as separate arguments, while the new code fragment combines them into a single argument. This could potentially cause the `substr` method to behave differently, depending on the values of `offset` and `length`.

DONE.
