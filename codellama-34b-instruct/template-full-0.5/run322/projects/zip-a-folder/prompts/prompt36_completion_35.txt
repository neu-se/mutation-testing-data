  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.end()` would cause the output stream to close immediately, whereas `output` would continue to be open and allow further data to be written to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.write('hello')
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.write('hello')` would write the string 'hello' to the output stream, whereas `output` would not write anything.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.pipe(process.stdout)
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.pipe(process.stdout)` would pipe the output stream to the standard output stream, whereas `output` would not be piped to anything.

DONE.
