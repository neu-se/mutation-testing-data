  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'function' && a.length === 2
```
This change will cause the `pull` function to return a different value when the `a` argument is a function with two arguments, which may cause the test suite to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'function' && a.length === 0
```
This change will cause the `pull` function to return a different value when the `a` argument is a function with no arguments, which may cause the test suite to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'object' && a.length === 1
```
This change will cause the `pull` function to return a different value when the `a` argument is an object with one property, which may cause the test suite to fail.

DONE.
