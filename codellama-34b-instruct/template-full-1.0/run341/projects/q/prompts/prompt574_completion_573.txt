  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `this` keyword, which refers to the function's context, while `null` would not provide any context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `arguments` object, which contains the values of the function's arguments, while `undefined` is a special value that indicates the absence of any defined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `this` keyword and the `arguments` object, while `0` is a numerical value that would not provide any context or arguments.

DONE.
