  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes.length
```
This code fragment will return the length of the `attributes` object, which may be different from the original code fragment `attributes` which returns the object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes[0]
```
This code fragment will return the first element of the `attributes` object, which may be different from the original code fragment `attributes` which returns the object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes.pop()
```
This code fragment will remove and return the last element of the `attributes` object, which may be different from the original code fragment `attributes` which returns the object itself.

DONE.
