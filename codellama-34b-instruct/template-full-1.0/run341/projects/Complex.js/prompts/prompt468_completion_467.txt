  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the variable `b` is compared to 0, while in the mutated code, the negated version of `b` is compared to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(b) > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the variable `b` is compared to 0, while in the mutated code, the absolute value of `b` is compared to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the variable `b` is compared to 0, while in the mutated code, the variable `b` is checked to see if it is NaN.

DONE.
