  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[1] > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only concatenate stacks that were created before the rejection if the line number of the stack is greater than 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[1] === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only concatenate stacks that were created before the rejection if the line number of the stack is equal to 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[1] < 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only concatenate stacks that were created before the rejection if the line number of the stack is less than 1.

DONE.
