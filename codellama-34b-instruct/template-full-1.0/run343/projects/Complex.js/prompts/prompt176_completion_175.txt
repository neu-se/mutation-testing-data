  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.acos` returns the arccosine of a number, which is the inverse of `Math.cos`. In contrast, `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` returns the sine of a number, which is not the same as the absolute value of a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `cos` is a mistake and is not a valid function in JavaScript.

DONE.
