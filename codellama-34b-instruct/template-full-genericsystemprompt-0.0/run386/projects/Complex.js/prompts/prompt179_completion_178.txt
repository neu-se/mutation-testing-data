  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Math.abs()` function to always return the absolute value of `a`, rather than the absolute value of `c`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Math.abs()` function to always return the absolute value of `b`, rather than the absolute value of `c`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Math.abs()` function to always return the absolute value of `a + b`, rather than the absolute value of `c`.

DONE.
