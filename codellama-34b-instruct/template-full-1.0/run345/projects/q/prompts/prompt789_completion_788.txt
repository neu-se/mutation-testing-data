  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.catch` would catch any rejections that `this.then` would not catch.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.then(null, null)` would catch any rejections and ignore any fulfillments, whereas `this.then` would only catch fulfillments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(null, noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.then(null, noop)` would catch any rejections and ignore any fulfillments, whereas `this.then` would only catch fulfillments.

DONE.
