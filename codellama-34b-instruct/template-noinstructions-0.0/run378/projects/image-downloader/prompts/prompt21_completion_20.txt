  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options.url` property is not the same as the `options.dest` property, and the `path.isAbsolute()` method would return a different result for the two properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method would return an array of strings, and the `pop()` method would return the last element of the array, which is not the same as the `options.dest` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.replace(/\//g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace()` method would replace all occurrences of the `/` character with an empty string, which would change the value of the `options.dest` property.

DONE.
