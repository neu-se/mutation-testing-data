  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.retain(1, iter.next(1).attributes || {}, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the same number of characters as the original line, but with different attributes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.retain(iter.next(1).length, iter.next(1).attributes || {}, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain a different number of characters than the original line, but with the same attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.retain(1, AttributeMap.diff(iter.next(1).attributes, {}), i)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the same number of characters as the original line, but with different attributes.

DONE.
