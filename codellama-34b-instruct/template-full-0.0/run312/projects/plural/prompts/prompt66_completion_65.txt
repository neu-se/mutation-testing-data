  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('memo', 'memo')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a new rule to the `rules` array, while this code fragment would simply replace the existing rule for "memo" with the same rule.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('memo', 'memos')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a new rule to the `rules` array, while this code fragment would simply replace the existing rule for "memo" with a new rule that always returns "memos".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('memo', function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a new rule to the `rules` array, while this code fragment would simply replace the existing rule for "memo" with a new rule that always returns the input word with an "s" appended
