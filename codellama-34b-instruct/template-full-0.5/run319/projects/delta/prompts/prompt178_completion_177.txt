  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.retain` is a different value than `otherOp.retain.length`, and it would cause the `while` loop to iterate more times than necessary.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.delete` is a different value than `otherOp.retain.length`, and it would cause the `while` loop to iterate more times than necessary.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.attributes` is a different value than `otherOp.retain.length`, and it would cause the `while` loop to iterate more times than necessary.

DONE.
