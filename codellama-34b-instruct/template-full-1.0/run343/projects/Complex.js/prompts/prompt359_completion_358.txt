  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in a divide by zero error, which is different behavior than the original code (Math.cos) which would return 0 for values of 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cosh
```
This would result in different behavior for values of large absolute value, since cosh(x) = (e^x + e^(-x))/2, while cos(x) = (e^(ix) + e^(-ix))/2, so cosh(x) - cos(x) = (e^x - e^(-x))/2, which is non-zero for large x.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos
```
This would result in different behavior for values of pi/2, since acos(x) = 0 if and only if x = cos(0) = 1.

DONE.
