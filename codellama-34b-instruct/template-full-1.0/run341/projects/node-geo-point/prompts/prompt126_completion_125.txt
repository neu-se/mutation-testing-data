  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `calculateDestination` would return `NaN` instead of a valid geo point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `calculateDestination` would return `undefined` instead of a valid geo point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `calculateDestination` would return `null` instead of a valid geo point.

DONE.
