  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `!resolve` would negate the `resolve` value, which would cause the `deferred.resolve` method to not be called, leading to a different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve()` would call the `resolve` method immediately, rather than waiting for the promise to be fullfilled, which would cause the promise to be settled before the `deferred.resolve` method is called, leading to a different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` would cause the promise to be rejected, rather than resolved, which would lead to a different behavior in the `deferred.resolve` method.

Note that these are just examples of code fragments that could be used to replace the PLACEHOLDER in the original code, and the exact behavior of the mutated code will
