  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (currentUrl of urlMap.keys()){
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the keys of the Map instead of the values, which would cause the subsequent code to fail to retrieve the corresponding value for each key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (currentUrl of urlMap.values().reverse()){
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the values of the Map in reverse order, which would cause the order of the output to be different from the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (currentUrl of urlMap.entries()){
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the key-value pairs of the Map, which would cause the subsequent code to fail to retrieve the corresponding value for each key.

DONE.
