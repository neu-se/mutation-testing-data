  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `aborted` is a boolean value, while `null` is a null value. This would cause the `if` statement that checks for `aborted` to evaluate to `false`, even if the `abort` function has been called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `aborted` is a boolean value, while `undefined` is a special value that represents the absence of a value. This would cause the `if` statement that checks for `aborted` to evaluate to `false`, even if the `abort` function has been called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `aborted` is a boolean value, while `false` is a boolean value that represents the opposite of `true`. This would cause the `if` statement that checks for `
