  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `allResolved` function to return a rejected promise instead of a fulfilled promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `allResolved` function to return a fulfilled promise instead of a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `allResolved` function to return a fulfilled promise with a value of `null` instead of a rejected promise.

DONE.
