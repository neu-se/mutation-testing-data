  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the string to lowercase, which could affect the behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the string to uppercase, which could affect the behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trim()` method would remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the string, which could affect the behavior of the code.

DONE.
