  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the value of `key` in `b` to the value of `key` in `a`, rather than comparing the value of `a[key]` to `b[key]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] === b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the value of `a[key]` to the value of `b[key]`, rather than comparing the value of `key` in `a` to the value of `key` in `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the value of `a[key]` to the value of `b[key]`, rather than comparing the value of `key` in `a` to the value of `key` in `b`.

DONE.
