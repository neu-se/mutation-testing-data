  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Test error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throw` statement would cause the promise to be rejected with an error, which would trigger the `rejected` callback in the `then` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(new Error("Test error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.reject` method would return a rejected promise, which would trigger the `rejected` callback in the `then` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.resolve(new Error("Test error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.resolve` method would return a resolved promise with an error value, which would trigger the `fulfilled` callback in the `then` method.

DONE.
