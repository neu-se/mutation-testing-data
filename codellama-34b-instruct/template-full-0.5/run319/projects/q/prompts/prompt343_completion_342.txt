  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function would be called with the fulfilled value, which would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled(value) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fulfilled` function would be called with the fulfilled value plus one, which would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled(value).then(rejected)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fulfilled` function would be called with the fulfilled value, and the `rejected` function would be called with the result of the `fulfilled` function, which would cause an error.

DONE.
