  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(bound).fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is not called on the correct object. In the original code, `fail` is called on the result of `Q(bound).fapply(nodeArgs)`, which is a promise. In this modified code, `fail` is called on `deferred.reject`, which is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(bound).fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.resolve);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is called with the wrong argument. In the original code, `fail` is called with `deferred.reject` as its argument. In this modified code, `fail` is called with `deferred.resolve` as its argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(bound).fapply(nodeArgs).fail(function () {
