  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens <= null
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison operator would produce a different result if `tokens` is `null` or an empty string. In the original code, `tokens` is initialized as an array, so the comparison would always be `false` and the code would execute normally. In the modified code, if `tokens` is `null` or an empty string, the comparison would be `true` and the code would exit with an error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!tokens
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator inverts the truthiness of the operand. In the original code, if `tokens` is not an array, the comparison would produce an error message. In the modified code, if `tokens` is truthy, the comparison would evaluate to `false`, and the code would execute normally. If `tokens` is falsy, the comparison would evaluate to `true`, and the code would exit with an error message
