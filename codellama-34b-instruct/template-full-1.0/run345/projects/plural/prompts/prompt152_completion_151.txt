  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked if the number was not equal to 1, but the new fragment always evaluates to 1, so it would always enter the `if` block.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked if the number was not equal to 1, but the new fragment would always be a string, so it would never enter the `if` block.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked if the number was not equal to 1, but the new fragment would multiply the number by 2, so the result would be different.

DONE.
