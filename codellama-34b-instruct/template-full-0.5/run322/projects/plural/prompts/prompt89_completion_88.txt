  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'person', 'person'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `plural` function to return the same word instead of the plural form, which would break the functionality of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'person', 'peoplez'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `plural` function to return a different word than the expected plural form, which would break the functionality of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'person', function() { return 'people' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `plural` function to return a function instead of a string, which would break the functionality of the function.

DONE.
