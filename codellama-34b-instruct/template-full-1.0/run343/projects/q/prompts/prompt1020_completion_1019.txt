  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"send"
```
This would result in different behavior because "send" is a different message type than "post", and the object's `dispatch` method would handle it differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"push"
```
This would result in different behavior because "push" is a different method than "dispatch", and the object would not have a "push" method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"postSend"
```
This would result in different behavior because "postSend" is not a valid message type, and the object's `dispatch` method would not recognize it.

DONE.
