  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` function would be called instead of the `deferred.resolve` function, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be passed as the first argument to the `deferred.resolve` function, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a `TypeError` instead of resolved with the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as the first argument to the `deferred.resolve` function, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a `TypeError` instead of resolved with the expected value.

DONE.
