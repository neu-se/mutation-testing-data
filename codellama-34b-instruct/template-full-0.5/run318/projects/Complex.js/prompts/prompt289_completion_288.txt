  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative sign would cause the `sinh` function to return the opposite value, which would affect the calculation of the complex number's cosine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh(b) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `1` would be added to the result of the `sinh` function, which would affect the calculation of the complex number's cosine.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinh` function would be applied to the wrong variable, which would affect the calculation of the complex number's cosine.

DONE.
