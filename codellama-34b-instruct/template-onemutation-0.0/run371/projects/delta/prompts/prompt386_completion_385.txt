  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `length` variable to be initialized to a value that is larger than the actual length of the `other` delta, which could cause the `while` loop to iterate more times than necessary, potentially leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
