  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {
    throw new Error("Something went wrong");
});

This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is used to handle the resolution of the promise, but instead of returning a new promise, it throws an error. This would cause the promise to be rejected, which would trigger the `catch` method if it is present.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
