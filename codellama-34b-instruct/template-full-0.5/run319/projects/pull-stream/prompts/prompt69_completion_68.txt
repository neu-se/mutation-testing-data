  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
doneLackingErr.message
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a reference to the `doneLackingErr` variable, which is an `Error` object. By adding `.message` to the end of the reference, the code would be attempting to access the `message` property of the `Error` object, which may not exist or may have a different value than the original `doneLackingErr` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
doneLackingErr.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a reference to the `doneLackingErr` variable, which is an `Error` object. By adding `.stack` to the end of the reference, the code would be attempting to access the `stack` property of the `Error` object, which may not exist or may have a different value than the original `doneLackingErr` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
