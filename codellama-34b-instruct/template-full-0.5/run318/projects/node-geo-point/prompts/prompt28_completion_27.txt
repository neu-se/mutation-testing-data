  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(point1.latitude + point2.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0, regardless of the values of `point1.latitude` and `point2.latitude`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(point1.latitude - point2.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the difference between `point1.latitude` and `point2.latitude`, which could be positive or negative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(point1.latitude * point2.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the product of `point1.latitude` and `point2.latitude`, which could be positive or negative.

DONE.
