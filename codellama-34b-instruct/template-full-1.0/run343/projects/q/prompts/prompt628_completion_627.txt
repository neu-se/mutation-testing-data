  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[value, value]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the value of the property to the same value, regardless of the input. In the original code, the property value is set based on the input arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the property value to `undefined`, regardless of the input. In the original code, the property value is set based on the input arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[value, Promise.resolve(value)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the property value to a resolved promise, regardless of the input. In the original code, the property value is set based on the input arguments.

DONE.
