  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.update
```
This would result in different behavior because `update` is a different method that takes a callback function as its third argument, whereas `set` does not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rm
```
This would result in different behavior because `rm` is a different method that takes a key and a callback function as its arguments, whereas `set` takes a key, a value, and a callback function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get
```
This would result in different behavior because `get` is a different method that retrieves the value associated with a key, whereas `set` sets the value associated with a key.

DONE.
