  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the order of operations in the expression, potentially leading to a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `a`, potentially leading to a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the values of `a` and `b`, potentially leading to a different result.

DONE.
