  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'coordinate'
```
This would result in different behavior because the property name is different, and the code would not be able to access the correct property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'coordinates'[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be accessing the first element of the coordinates array, rather than the coordinates property itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'coordinates'[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be accessing the second element of the coordinates array, rather than the coordinates property itself.

DONE.
