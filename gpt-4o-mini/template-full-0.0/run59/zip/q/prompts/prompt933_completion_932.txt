Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat([this])
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends the current context (`this`) to the `args` array, altering the arguments passed to the `Q.denodeify` function and potentially changing the function's execution context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the last argument from the `args` array, which could lead to missing necessary parameters when calling the `Q.denodeify` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[args]
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps the `args` array in another array, effectively passing a single array as an argument instead of the individual elements of the `args` array, which would cause the function to fail or behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
