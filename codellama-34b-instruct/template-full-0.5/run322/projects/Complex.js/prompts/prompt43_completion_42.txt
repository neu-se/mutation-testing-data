  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== undefined && a !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is `undefined` or `null`, while this new code fragment checks if `a` is not `undefined` and not `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === undefined || a === null || a === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is `undefined` or `null`, while this new code fragment checks if `a` is `undefined`, `null`, or `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === undefined || a === null || a === NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is `undefined` or `null`, while this new code fragment checks if `a` is `undefined`, `null`, or `NaN`.

DONE.
