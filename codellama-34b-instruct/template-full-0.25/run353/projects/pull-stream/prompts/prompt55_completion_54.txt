  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `read` function, while the modified code fragment is a reference to the `read` function plus 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `read` function, while the modified code fragment is a reference to the `read` function minus 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `read` function, while the modified code fragment is a reference to the `read` function multiplied by 2.

DONE.
