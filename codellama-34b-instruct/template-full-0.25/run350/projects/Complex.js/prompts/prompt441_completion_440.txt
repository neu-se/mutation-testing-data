  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the real part of the complex number instead of the imaginary part, which is the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the result of the multiplication, which would change the final result of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the result of the multiplication, which would change the final result of the function.

DONE.
