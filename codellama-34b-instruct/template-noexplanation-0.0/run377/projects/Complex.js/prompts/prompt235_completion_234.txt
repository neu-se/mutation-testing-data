  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a*a + b*b)
```
This code fragment calculates the square root of the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, which is equivalent to the absolute value of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a*a - b*b)
```
This code fragment calculates the square root of the difference of the squares of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, which is equivalent to the absolute value of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a*a + b*b) + Math.sqrt(a*a - b*b)
```
This code fragment calculates the sum of the absolute value of the complex number and the absolute value of the complex number with the real and imaginary parts swapped. This is not equivalent to the original code fragment, but it is a valid mathematical operation.

DONE.
