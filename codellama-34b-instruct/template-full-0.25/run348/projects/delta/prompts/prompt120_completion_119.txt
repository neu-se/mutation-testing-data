  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `elem.retain` is a different property than `elem.delete`, and it would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `elem.delete` is a number, leading to a different execution path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.delete + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `elem.delete` is not a number, leading to a different execution path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.delete - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `elem.delete` is a number, leading to a different execution path.

DONE.
