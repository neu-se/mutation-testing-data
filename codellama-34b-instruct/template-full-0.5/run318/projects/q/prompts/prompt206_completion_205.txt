  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the first element of the `fileNameAndLineNumber` array to `qFileName`, rather than comparing the entire array to `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the second element of the `fileNameAndLineNumber` array to `qStartingLine`, rather than comparing the entire array to `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the length of the `fileNameAndLineNumber` array to `qEndingLine`, rather than comparing the entire array to `undefined`.

DONE.
