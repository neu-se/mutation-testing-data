  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` method would immediately reject the promise, whereas the original code fragment `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise with a rejected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify` method would notify the promise of progress, whereas the original code fragment `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise with a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.inspect
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.inspect` method would return the state of the promise, whereas the original code fragment `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise with a value.

DONE.
