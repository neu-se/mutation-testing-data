Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `ret.url` to the original `currentUrlStr` instead of the parsed URL, potentially leading to incorrect URL formatting and loss of important URL components.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.href
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the full URL string (including the protocol, host, path, and query) to `ret.url`, which may not be the intended behavior if the parsed URL is not valid or complete.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only set `ret.url` to the pathname of the parsed URL, omitting the protocol, host, and any query parameters, which would lead to an incomplete URL representation.

DONE.
