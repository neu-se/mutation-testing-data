  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match the entire string instead of the substring starting from the first character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(1, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match the substring starting from the second character and ending at the second-to-last character, instead of the entire string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match the last character of the string, instead of the entire string.

DONE.
