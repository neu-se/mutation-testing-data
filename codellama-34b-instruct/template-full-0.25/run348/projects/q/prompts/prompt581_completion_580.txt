  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"throw"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throw` keyword is used to throw an exception, whereas the original code fragment uses the `throw` operator to throw an exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"throw new Error()"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throw` keyword is used to throw an exception, whereas the original code fragment uses the `throw` operator to throw an exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"throw new TypeError()"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throw` keyword is used to throw an exception, whereas the original code fragment uses the `throw` operator to throw an exception.

DONE.
