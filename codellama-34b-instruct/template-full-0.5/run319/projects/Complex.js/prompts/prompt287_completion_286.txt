  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(a) * Math.cosh(b) + Math.cos(a) * Math.sinh(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `sin` and `cos` functions to calculate the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, while this new code uses the `sinh` and `cosh` functions to calculate the real and imaginary parts. This would result in a different output for the `cos` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(a) * Math.cosh(b) - Math.sin(a) * Math.sinh(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `sin` and `cos` functions to calculate the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, while this new code uses the `cos` and `sinh` functions to calculate the real and imaginary parts. This would result in a different output for the `cos` function.
