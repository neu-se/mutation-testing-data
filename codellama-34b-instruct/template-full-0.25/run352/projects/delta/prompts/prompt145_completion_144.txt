  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a null value to the ops array, which would cause the code to throw an error when trying to access the `insert` property of the null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an undefined value to the ops array, which would cause the code to throw an error when trying to access the `insert` property of the undefined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a new op object to the ops array, which would cause the code to throw an error when trying to access the `insert` property of the new op object.

DONE.
