  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method would create a new function with a hard-coded `this` value of `null`, which would likely cause the code to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method would call the `makeNodeResolver` function with a `this` value of `null`, which would likely cause the code to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method would call the `makeNodeResolver` function with a `this` value of `null`, which would likely cause the code to fail.

DONE.
