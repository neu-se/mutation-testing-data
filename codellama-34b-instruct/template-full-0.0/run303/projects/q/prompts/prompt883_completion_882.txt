  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise with the error, rather than rejecting it, which could cause the program to continue executing with an error that was not handled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` would notify the promise with the error, rather than rejecting it, which could cause the program to continue executing with an error that was not handled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject("new error")
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject("new error")` would reject the promise with a different error message, which could cause the program to behave differently.

DONE.
