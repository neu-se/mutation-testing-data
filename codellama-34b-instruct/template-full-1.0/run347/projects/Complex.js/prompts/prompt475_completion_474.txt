  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method would return `true` for any non-zero imaginary part, even if the real part is finite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method would return `true` for any imaginary part greater than or equal to 1, even if the real part is finite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method would return `true` for any imaginary part greater than 0, even if the real part is finite.

DONE.
