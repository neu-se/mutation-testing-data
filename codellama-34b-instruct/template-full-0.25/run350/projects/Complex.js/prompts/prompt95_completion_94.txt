  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the value of `a` instead of `c`, which could lead to a different result in the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the value of `b` instead of `c`, which could lead to a different result in the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the values of `a` and `b` instead of using the value of `c`, which could lead to a different result in the calculation.

DONE.
