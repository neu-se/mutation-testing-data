  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/:.*/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator matches zero or more characters, whereas the `+` operator matches one or more characters. This would cause the regex to match a different set of strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/:.{1,}/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `{1,}` quantifier matches one or more characters, whereas the `+` operator matches one or more characters. This would cause the regex to match a different set of strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/:.{1}/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `{1}` quantifier matches exactly one character, whereas the `+` operator matches one or more characters. This would cause the regex to match a different set of strings.

DONE.
