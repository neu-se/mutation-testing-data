  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [name, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `apply` method instead of the `post` method, which would change the way the function is called and potentially cause it to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first argument of the `post` method, which could cause the method to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 0, -1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last argument of the `post` method, which could cause the method to fail or behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
