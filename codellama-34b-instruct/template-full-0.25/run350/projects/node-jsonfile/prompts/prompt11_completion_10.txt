  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the data to lowercase, which may not be desired in all cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method would split the data into an array of individual characters, which may not be desired in all cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.replace('foo', 'bar')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace()` method would replace all occurrences of the string 'foo' with the string 'bar', which may not be desired in all cases.

DONE.
