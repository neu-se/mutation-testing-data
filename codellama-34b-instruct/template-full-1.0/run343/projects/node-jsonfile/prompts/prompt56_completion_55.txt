  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replace(/\\n/g, EOL)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the "g" flag to replace all occurrences of "\n" with EOL, but this replacement would only replace the first occurrence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replace(/\r\n/g, EOL)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the "\n" character to match newlines, but this replacement would only match newlines that are followed by a carriage return character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replace(/[^\r\n]/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a regular expression to match all characters except newline characters, but this replacement would only match newline characters.

DONE.
