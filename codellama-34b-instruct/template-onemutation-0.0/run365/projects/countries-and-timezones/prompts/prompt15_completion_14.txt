  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.r !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `tz.r` is undefined, while the new code fragment checks if it is not undefined. This change would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `tz.r` is not undefined, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code.

DONE.
