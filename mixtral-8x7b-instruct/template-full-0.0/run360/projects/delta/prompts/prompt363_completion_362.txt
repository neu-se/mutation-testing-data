 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately call the `hasNext` method, whereas the original code fragment checks if `otherIter.hasNext` is truthy, which could be a different value (e.g., a function that has been overwritten).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
otherIter.peekType() !== 'insert' && otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an extra `hasNext()` call, which could cause the loop to terminate prematurely if `otherIter.hasNext()` returns a falsy value before the `peekType()` call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!otherIter.hasNext
