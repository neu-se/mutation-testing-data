  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(null, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method would be called with a `null` name and `false` deep flag, which would create a new policy with a `null` name and shallow copy of the rules, rather than a deep copy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(name, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method would be called with the same name and `true` deep flag, which would create a new policy with the same name and deep copy of the rules, rather than a shallow copy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(name + '1', false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method would be called with a modified name and `false` deep flag, which would create a new policy with a modified name and shallow copy of the rules, rather than a deep copy.
