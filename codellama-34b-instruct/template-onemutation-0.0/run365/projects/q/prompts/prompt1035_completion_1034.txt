  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nbind = function (/*thisp, ...args*/) {
    var args = array_slice(arguments, 0);
    args.unshift(this);
    return Q.nbind.apply(void 0, args);
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using `Q.nbind.apply(void 0, args)` which is a call to the `apply` method of the `Q.nbind` function, but the new code fragment is using `Q.nbind.apply(void 0, args)` which is a call to the `apply` method of the `Q.nbind` function with a different `this` value.

DONE.
