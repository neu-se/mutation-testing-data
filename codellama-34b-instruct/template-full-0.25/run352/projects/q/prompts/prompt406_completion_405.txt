  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value and does not have a `then` method, so it would not be treated as a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value and does not have a `then` method, so it would not be treated as a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Promise()
```
This would result in different behavior because `new Promise()` creates a new promise that is not related to the original promise, so it would not have the same behavior.

DONE.
