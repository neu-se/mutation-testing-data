  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a regular expression to replace the last occurrence of "/index.[a-z]+$" with "/", but the new code would replace the last occurrence of "/index.[a-z]+$" with a space.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a regular expression to replace the last occurrence of "/index.[a-z]+$" with "/", but the new code would replace the last occurrence of "/index.[a-z]+$" with a backslash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"/"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a regular expression to replace the last occurrence of "/index.[a-z]+$" with "/", but the new code would replace the last occurrence of "/index.[a-z]+$" with another forward slash, which would result in a different URL.
