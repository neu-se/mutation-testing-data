  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve()` returns a promise that is already resolved, whereas the original code fragment `Q` returns a promise that may or may not be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` returns a promise that is already rejected, whereas the original code fragment `Q` returns a promise that may or may not be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when()` returns a promise that is resolved with the given value, whereas the original code fragment `Q` returns a promise that may or may not be resolved with the given value.

DONE.
