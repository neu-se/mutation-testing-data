  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `d` is equal to zero, while this replacement checks whether `d` is not equal to zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `d` is not equal to zero, while this replacement checks whether `d` is equal to zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `d` is equal to zero, while this replacement checks whether `d` is greater than zero.

DONE.
