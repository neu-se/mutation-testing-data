  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('mouse', 'mouses')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the "s" suffix to the word "mouse" to form the plural form, while this replacement adds the "es" suffix, which is incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('mouse', 'mice')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the "s" suffix to the word "mouse" to form the plural form, while this replacement adds the "ice" suffix, which is correct.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('mouse', 'mouse')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the "s" suffix to the word "mouse" to form the plural form, while this replacement does not add any suffix, which is incorrect.

DONE.
