  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws an error, while the new code fragment would resolve the promise with a value of `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws an error, while the new code fragment would resolve the promise with a value of `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws an error, while the new code fragment would resolve the promise with a value of the string `"error"`.

DONE.
