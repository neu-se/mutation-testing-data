  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER> = (x < b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for `x > b`, which is not the same as `x < b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER> = (x == b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for `x > b`, which is not the same as `x == b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER> = (x >= b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for `x > b`, which is not the same as `x >= b`.

DONE.
