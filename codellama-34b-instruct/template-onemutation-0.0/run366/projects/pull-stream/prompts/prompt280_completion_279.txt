  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!mapper
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT, which will invert the truthiness of the `mapper` function. In the original code, the `mapper` function is called with the `data` argument, but in the mutated code, the `mapper` function is called with the inverted truthiness of the `data` argument. This could potentially cause the `mapper` function to behave differently, depending on its implementation.

DONE.
