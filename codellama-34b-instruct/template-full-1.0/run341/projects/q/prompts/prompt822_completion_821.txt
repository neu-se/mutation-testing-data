  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method is expected to receive a promise as its argument, replacing it with `void` would cause the method to be called without any arguments, which would likely result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the current object, which in this case is a promise. If `this` is used as the argument, it would cause the `done` method to be called on the same promise, which would not have any effect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because null is a valid value for the `done` method to be called on, but passing null would mean that the promise has already been resolved, and there is no reason to call the `done` method.

DONE.
