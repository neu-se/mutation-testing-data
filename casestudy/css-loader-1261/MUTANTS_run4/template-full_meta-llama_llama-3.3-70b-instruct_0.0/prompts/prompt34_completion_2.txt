Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
encodeURI
```
This would result in different behavior because `encodeURI` is used to encode a URI, whereas the original code used `decodeURI` to decode a URI, resulting in opposite operations being performed on the `normalizedUrl`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unescape.bind(null, normalizedUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because `unescape.bind(null, normalizedUrl)` would create a new function that calls `unescape` with `normalizedUrl` as its argument, but the `this` context would be set to `null`, potentially affecting the behavior of `unescape` if it relies on its `this` context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(id) { return id; }
```
This would result in different behavior because this replacement would be an identity function that simply returns its input without any decoding, whereas the original code used `decodeURI` to decode the URI, resulting in no decoding operation being performed on the `normalizedUrl`.

DONE.
