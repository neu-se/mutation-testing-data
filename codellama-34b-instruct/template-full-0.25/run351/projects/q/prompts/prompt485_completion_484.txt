  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.length = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reset the length of the `unhandledReasons` array to 0, which would cause the `getUnhandledReasons` method to return an empty array, even if there were unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

unhandledReasons.length = 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the length of the `unhandledReasons` array to 1, which would cause the `getUnhandledReasons` method to return an array with a single element, even if there were no unhandled rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.length = unhandledReasons.length + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the length of the `unhandledReasons` array by 1, which
