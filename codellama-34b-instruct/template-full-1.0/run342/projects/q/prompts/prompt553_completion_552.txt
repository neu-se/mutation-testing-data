  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.err
```
This would result in different behavior because the `err` property is not defined on the `result` object, causing the `when` function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("test")
```
This would result in different behavior because a new error object would be created and passed to the `when` function, which would handle it as an error and reject the resulting promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result
```
This would result in different behavior because the `result` object would be passed directly to the `when` function, causing it to treat it as a rejected promise and reject the resulting promise.

DONE.
