  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would remove the first element of the array instead of the last one, which is the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would remove the last element of the array instead of the first one, which is the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would remove the last element of the array instead of the first one, which is the intended behavior.

DONE.
