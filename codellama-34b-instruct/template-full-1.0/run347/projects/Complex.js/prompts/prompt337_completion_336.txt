  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of "b" directly, while the new fragment uses the negative of "b". This change in sign could cause the function to return a different value for certain inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2*a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of "a" directly, while the new fragment uses twice the value of "a". This change in magnitude could cause the function to return a different value for certain inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of "a" directly, while the new fragment uses the sum of "a" and "b". This change in value could cause the function to return a different value for certain inputs.

DONE.
