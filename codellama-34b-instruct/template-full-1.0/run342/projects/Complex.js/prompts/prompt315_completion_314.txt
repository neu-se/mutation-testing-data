  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(3 * a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Math.sin(a)` which takes the sine of the angle `a` and outputs a value in the range [-1, 1], while `Math.sin(3 * a)` takes the sine of `3` times the angle `a` and outputs a value in the range [-3, 3].

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Math.sin(a)` which takes the sine of the angle `a` and outputs a value in the range [-1, 1], while `Math.tan(a)` takes the tangent of the angle `a` and outputs a value in the range (-∞, ∞).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.asin(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because
