  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.shift
```
This will cause the first element of the `laterQueue` array to be removed and returned, rather than the last element as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.length
```
This will cause the length of the `laterQueue` array to be returned, rather than the last element as in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.pop()
```
This will cause the last element of the `laterQueue` array to be removed and returned, rather than the first element as in the original code.

DONE.
