Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
link.getName()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was likely getting the parent path, but this change would get the name of the link instead, potentially resulting in an incorrect path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
link.getParentPath() + '/' + link.getName()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was likely getting the parent path, but this change would append the name of the link to the parent path, potentially resulting in an incorrect path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was likely getting the parent path, but this change would result in an empty string, potentially causing issues with subsequent file operations.

DONE.
