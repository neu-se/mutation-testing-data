 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peekLength(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns 0 as the length of the next operation, which may cause the `diff()` function to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peekLength(thisIter.current())
