Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sw.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the switch string to uppercase, potentially changing the output and behavior of the program, especially if the switch strings are used in a case-sensitive manner.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'-' + sw
```
This would result in different behavior because it unconditionally prefixes the switch string with a hyphen, regardless of whether it should be a short or long option, potentially leading to incorrect option formatting.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.alias[sw] || sw
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to use an alias for the switch string if one exists, potentially changing the output and behavior of the program, especially if the aliases are not correctly defined or handled.

DONE.
