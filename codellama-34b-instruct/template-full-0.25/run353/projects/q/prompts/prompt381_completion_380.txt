  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) {
    return value;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the promise directly, while this new code fragment returns a new promise that is resolved with the value of the original promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) {
    return value + 1;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the promise directly, while this new code fragment returns a new promise that is resolved with the value of the original promise plus 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) {
    return value.then(function (value) {
        return value + 1;
    });
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the promise directly, while this new code fragment returns a new promise that is resolved with the value of the original promise
