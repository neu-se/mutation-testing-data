  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
alignarry.fromCallback
```
This would result in different behavior because the `universalify.fromCallback` method is used to wrap a callback-based function into a promise-based function, while `alignarry.fromCallback` is not a valid method and will cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
js cheatcodes
```
This would result in different behavior because `js cheatcodes` is not a valid method and will cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readFile
```
This would result in different behavior because a reference to the `_readFile` function is replaced with `this._readFile`, which will cause the function to be called on a different object than intended.

DONE.
