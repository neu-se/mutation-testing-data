  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.split
```
This would result in different behavior because `split` returns an array of strings, while `match` returns an object that describes the match.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `part[0]` refers to the first character of the string, while `match` returns an object that describes the entire match.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `length` returns the length of the string, while `match` returns an object that describes the entire match.

DONE.
