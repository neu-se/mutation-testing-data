  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getNumStr(min)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `min` variable is not the same as the `input` variable in the original `getNumStr` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getNumStr(hours)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hours` variable is not the same as the `input` variable in the original `getNumStr` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getNumStr(offset)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `offset` variable is not the same as the `input` variable in the original `getNumStr` function.

DONE.
