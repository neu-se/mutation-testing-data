 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of tracking the rejection in the correct `unhandledRejections` array, it would always push an empty array, which would not accurately represent the unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unhandledRejections.length = unhandledRejections.length + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it increments the length of the `unhandledRejections` array instead of pushing the promise to the array, which would lead to incorrect tracking of unhandled rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unhandledRejections.push(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes `null` to the `unhandledRejections` array instead of the actual promise, which would lead to incorrect tracking of unhandled rejections and make it difficult to identify the actual unhandled rejections.
