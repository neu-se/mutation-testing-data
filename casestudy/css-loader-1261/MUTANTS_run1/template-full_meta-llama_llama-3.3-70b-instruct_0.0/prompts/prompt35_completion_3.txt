Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
encodeURI(normalizedUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because `encodeURI` is used instead of `unescape`, which would change the way special characters are handled in the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
normalizedUrl.replace(/%/g, '%25')
```
This would result in different behavior because it manually escapes '%' characters, which could lead to incorrect URL decoding in certain cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
url
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the original `url` instead of the `normalizedUrl`, which could lead to incorrect URL decoding if the original URL contains escaped characters that were removed during normalization.

DONE.
