 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.pow(Math.E, a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates `a` raised to the power of `Math.E` instead of the original code which calculates `e` raised to the power of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(2 * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates `e` raised to the power of `2 * b` instead of the original code which calculates `e` raised to the power of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates `e` raised to the power of `(a + b)` instead of the original code which calculates `e` raised to the power of `a`.

DONE.
