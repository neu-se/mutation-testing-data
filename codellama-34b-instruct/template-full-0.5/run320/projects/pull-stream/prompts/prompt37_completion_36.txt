  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[4]
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref[4]` is a different element of the `ref` array than `ref[3]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref[2]` is a different element of the `ref` array than `ref[3]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref[0]` is a different element of the `ref` array than `ref[3]`.

DONE.
