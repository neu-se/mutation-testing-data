  Option 1: PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return ['horse', 'cat'][Math.random() * 2 | 0]
```
This would return a random word from the list ['horse', 'cat'] instead of the correct plural form, which would result in an incorrect plural form for a given word.

Option 2: PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return type(rule[1]) === 'Function' ? rule[1](w.slice(0, w.length - 1)) : w
```
This would slice the input word to make it shorter and return it, regardless of the rule that applies to the word.

Option 3: PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return void 0
```
This would return `undefined` instead of the correct plural form, which would result in the word not being pluralized.

DONE.
