  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the condition to check if `a` is greater than `b`, which is not the same as checking if `b` is equal to 0 and `a` is greater than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the condition to check if `a` is equal to `b`, which is not the same as checking if `b` is equal to 0 and `a` is greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the condition to check if `a` plus `b` is equal to 0, which is not the same as checking if `b` is equal to 0 and `a` is greater than 0.

DONE.
