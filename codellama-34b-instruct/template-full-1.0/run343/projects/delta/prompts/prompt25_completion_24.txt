  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key], b[key] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the result of the comparison to always be `false`, even if the values of `a[key]` and `b[key]` are equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] === b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, including type equality, while the `==` operator only checks for value equality. If `a[key]` and `b[key]` are of different types, the `===` operator would return `false`, while the `==` operator might still return `true` if the values are the same.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, including type inequality, while the `!=` operator only
