  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the parentheses are required to call the `hasNext()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasNext` property is being accessed instead of the `hasNext()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasNext()` method is being called with an argument of `1`, which would cause the loop to iterate only once.

DONE.
