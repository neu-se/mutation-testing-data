  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.dispatch.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` would be bound to `promise` instead of the original `this` context, which could break the code if `dispatch` relies on the original context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.dispatch.apply(this, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` would change the `this` context of `dispatch` to the original `this` context, but also pass the `arguments` object as an array, which could break the code if `dispatch` expects a variadic number of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.dispatch(...arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because the spread operator would pass each argument in `arguments` as a separate argument to `dispatch`, which could break the code if `dispatch` expects a specific number of arguments.

DONE.
