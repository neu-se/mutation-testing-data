 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve(promise).tap
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps the `promise` in a new resolved promise before calling `tap`, which is not the behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q(promise).thenResolve().tap
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the `promise` to be resolved before calling `tap`, which is not the behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q(null).tap
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls `tap` on a new promise that is resolved with `null`, instead of calling `tap` on the original `promise`.

DONE.
