  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a specific `this` context, which would cause the `then` method to be called on a different object than the original promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.apply(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` calls a function with a specific `this` context and arguments provided as an array, which would cause the `then` method to be called on a different object than the original promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` calls a function with a specific `this` context and arguments provided individually, which would cause the `then` method to be called on a different object than the original promise.

DONE.
