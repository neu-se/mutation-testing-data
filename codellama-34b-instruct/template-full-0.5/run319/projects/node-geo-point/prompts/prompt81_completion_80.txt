  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the latitude instead of the longitude to calculate the destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude + 10
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 10 to the longitude, which would cause the destination point to be calculated based on a different longitude value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() * 360 - 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a random longitude value between -180 and 180, which would cause the destination point to be calculated based on a different longitude value.

DONE.
