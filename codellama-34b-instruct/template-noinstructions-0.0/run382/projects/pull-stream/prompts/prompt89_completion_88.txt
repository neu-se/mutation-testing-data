  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test = prop(test) || id
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `test` function to be called with the `test` argument, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test = prop(test) || id
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `test` function to be called with the `test` argument, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test = prop(test) || id
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `test` function to be called with the `test` argument, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
