  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr, false, false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse` method would be called with the `slashesDenoteHost` and `decodeURIComponent` options set to `false`, which could cause the method to parse the URL differently and return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr, true, false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse` method would be called with the `slashesDenoteHost` option set to `true`, which could cause the method to parse the URL differently and return a different result.

DONE.
