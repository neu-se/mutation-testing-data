  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` and `b` are different values, and the calculation would be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by `b` would change the result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition by `b` would change the result of the calculation.

DONE.
