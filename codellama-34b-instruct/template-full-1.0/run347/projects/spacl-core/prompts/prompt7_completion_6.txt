  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\/\//, 'g') !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `true` if the path contains any "//", even if it's not at the beginning.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\/\//, 'i') !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `true` if the path contains any "//", even if it's not case-sensitive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\/\//, 'm') !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `true` if the path contains any "//", even if it's not in the middle of the path.

DONE.
