  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match the entire string instead of just the first character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match the entire string and return the first match, which could be different from the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/).length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match the entire string and return the length of the first match, which could be different from the original behavior.

DONE.
