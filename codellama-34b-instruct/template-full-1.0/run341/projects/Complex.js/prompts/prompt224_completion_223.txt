  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a != 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would only execute the following code if `a` is greater than or equal to zero, while the new code fragment would execute it for any non-zero value of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would only execute the following code if `a` is greater than or equal to the value of `Math.PI`, while the new code fragment would execute it for any value of `a` greater than `Math.PI`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would only execute the following code if `a` is a number, while the new code fragment would execute it for any value of `a` that is not a number.

DONE.
