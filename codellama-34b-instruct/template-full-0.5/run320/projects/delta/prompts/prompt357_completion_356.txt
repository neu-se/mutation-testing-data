  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking whether `arg` is equal to 0, while the mutated code fragment is checking whether `arg + 1` is equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking whether `arg` is equal to 0, while the mutated code fragment is checking whether `arg - 1` is equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!arg
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking whether `arg` is equal to 0, while the mutated code fragment is checking whether `arg` is not equal to 0.

DONE.
