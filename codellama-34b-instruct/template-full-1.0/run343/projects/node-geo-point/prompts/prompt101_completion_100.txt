  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `φ1` and `φ2` are different latitude values, and the `calculateDestination` method uses them to calculate the destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `λ1` and `λ2` are different longitude values, and the `calculateDestination` method uses them to calculate the destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(φ1 + φ2) / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculation of the destination point is based on the average of the two latitude values, rather than the actual values.

DONE.
