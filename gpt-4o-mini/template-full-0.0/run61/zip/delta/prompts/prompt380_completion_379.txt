Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the `otherIter` to skip the next two operations instead of just the next one, potentially causing the transformation to miss important operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it retrieves the next operation without advancing the iterator, which means the same operation would be processed multiple times instead of moving forward in the iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it effectively does nothing (it advances the iterator by zero), which could lead to an infinite loop or incorrect processing of subsequent operations since the same operation would be considered repeatedly.

DONE.
