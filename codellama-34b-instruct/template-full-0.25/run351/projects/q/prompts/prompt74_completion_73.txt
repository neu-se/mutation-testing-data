  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `setTimeout` is now `1` instead of `0`, which would cause the `flush` function to be called after a delay of `1` millisecond instead of immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush, -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `setTimeout` is now `-1` instead of `0`, which would cause the `flush` function to be called after a delay of `-1` millisecond instead of immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `setTimeout` is now `null` instead of `0`, which would cause the `flush` function to be called immediately without any delay.

DONE.
