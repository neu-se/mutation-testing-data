  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[value, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method now receives the `key` parameter as the first argument instead of the `value` parameter, which may cause errors if the `key` parameter is used in the method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[null, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method now receives a `null` value as the first argument instead of the `value` parameter, which may cause errors if the `value` parameter is used in the method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[value, "key"]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method now receives a string value of `"key"` as the second argument instead of the `key` parameter, which may cause errors if the `key` parameter is used in the method.

DONE.
