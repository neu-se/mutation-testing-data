  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring` method would return a new string that is a subset of the original `targetFilePath` string, which could cause the `access` method to fail if the substring is not a valid file path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase` method would return a new string that is the original `targetFilePath` string converted to uppercase, which could cause the `access` method to fail if the uppercase string is not a valid file path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method would split the `targetFilePath` string into an array of substrings using the `/` character as the delimiter, and the `pop` method would return the last element of the array
