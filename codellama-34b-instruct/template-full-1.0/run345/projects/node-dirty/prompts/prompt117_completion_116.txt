  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an event with no arguments, instead of emitting an event with a single argument `'read_close'`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('read_close', this.path)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an event with two arguments `('read_close', this.path)` instead of emitting an event with a single argument `('read_close')`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', this._data.size)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an event with a different argument `('load', this._data.size)` instead of emitting an event with a single argument `('read_close')`.

DONE.
