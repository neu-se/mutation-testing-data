Your task is to apply mutation testing to the following code:
```
'use strict'

var drain = require('./drain')

module.exports = function reduce (reducer, acc, cb ) {
  if(!cb) cb = acc, acc = null
  var sink = drain(function (data) {
    acc = reducer(<PLACEHOLDER>)
  }, function (err) {
    cb(err, acc)
  })
  if (arguments.length === 2)
    return function (source) {
      source(null, function (end, data) {
        //if ended immediately, and no initial...
        if(end) return cb(end === true ? null : end)
        acc = data; sink(source)
      })
    }
  else
    return sink
}

```

by replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different
behavior than the original code fragment, which was:
```
acc, data
```
Please consider changes such as using different operators, changing constants,
referring to different variables, object properties, functions, or methods.  

Provide three answers as fenced code blocks containing a single line of code,
using the following template:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Please conclude your response with "DONE."
