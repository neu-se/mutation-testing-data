  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would change the value of the `updater` function, which is not intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator would change the value of the `updater` function, which is not intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `/ 2` operator would change the value of the `updater` function, which is not intended.

DONE.
