Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly uses the `retain` property of `thisOp`, which may not accurately reflect the length of the operation, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the operation's length in the context of line processing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the length returned by `peekLength()`, which could cause the code to incorrectly process one extra character, leading to off-by-one errors in line handling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(thisOp) + Op.length(thisOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because it doubles the length of `thisOp`, which would incorrectly treat the operation as if it were twice as long, potentially causing issues in how the operations are processed and rendered.

DONE.
