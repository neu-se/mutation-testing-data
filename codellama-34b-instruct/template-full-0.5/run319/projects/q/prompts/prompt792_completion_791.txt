  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as the first argument to `rejected`, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be passed as the first argument to `rejected`, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function would be called with `null` as its first argument, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
