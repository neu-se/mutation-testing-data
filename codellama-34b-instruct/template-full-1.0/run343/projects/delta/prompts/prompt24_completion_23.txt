  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it will invert the boolean value of `b[key]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[anotherKey]
```
This would result in different behavior because it will compare a different property of `b` than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key] + anotherValue
```
This would result in different behavior because it will add a different value to `b[key]`.

DONE.
