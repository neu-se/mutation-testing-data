  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `eachLine` method would start iterating from the second line instead of the first line, potentially skipping over important content.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `eachLine` method would start iterating from the previous line instead of the current line, potentially including content that should not be included.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `eachLine` method would start iterating from the doubled line number instead of the current line, potentially skipping over important content or including duplicate content.

DONE.
