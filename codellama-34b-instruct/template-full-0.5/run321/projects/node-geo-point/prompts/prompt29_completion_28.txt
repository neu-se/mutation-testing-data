  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the longitude value instead of the latitude value, which could cause errors in the calculation of the distance between the two points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.latitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the latitude value, which could cause errors in the calculation of the distance between the two points.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.latitude * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the latitude value, which could cause errors in the calculation of the distance between the two points.

DONE.
