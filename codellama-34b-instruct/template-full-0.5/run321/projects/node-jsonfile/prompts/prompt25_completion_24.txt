  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.parse()` would throw an error when trying to parse `null`, whereas the original code would have returned `null` without parsing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.parse()` would throw an error when trying to parse `undefined`, whereas the original code would have returned `null` without parsing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.parse()` would throw an error when trying to parse the string `"foo"`, whereas the original code would have returned `null` without parsing.

DONE.
