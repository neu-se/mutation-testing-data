  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument is now incremented by 1, which changes the result of the `Math.sin()` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument is now doubled, which changes the result of the `Math.sin()` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg'] - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument is now decremented by 1, which changes the result of the `Math.sin()` function.

DONE.
