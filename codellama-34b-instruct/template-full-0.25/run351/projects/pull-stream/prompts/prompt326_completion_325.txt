  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only calls `once` with a single argument, `end`, while this modified code calls it with two arguments, `end` and `data`. This could potentially cause the `once` function to behave differently, depending on how it is implemented.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(end, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not pass `null` as the second argument to `once`, while this modified code does. This could potentially cause the `once` function to behave differently, depending on how it is implemented.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(end, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not pass `undefined` as the second argument to `once`, while this modified code does. This could potentially cause the `once` function to behave differently, depending on how it is implemented.
