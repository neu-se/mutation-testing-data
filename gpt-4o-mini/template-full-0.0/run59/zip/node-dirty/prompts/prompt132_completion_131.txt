Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key] of this._queue
```
This would result in different behavior because it ignores the `cbs` callback functions associated with each key, potentially leading to unhandled errors when writing to the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, cbs] of this._data
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly iterates over `this._data` instead of `this._queue`, which would cause the flushing mechanism to fail as it would not process the intended queue of write operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, cbs] of this._queue.entries()
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to use the `entries()` method, which does not exist on the data structure of `this._queue`, leading to a runtime error instead of processing the queue correctly.

DONE.
