 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
start + index
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the subtraction to addition, which would lead to incorrect `start` and `end` indexes when slicing the `ops` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(start - index)
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the subtraction result to its absolute value, which would lead to incorrect `start` and `end` indexes when slicing the `ops` array. The absolute value would not account for the direction of the difference between `start` and `index`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
start * index
