  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments)[name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `array_slice` function with a single argument, which would result in a different array being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[deferred.resolve(value),...]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `deferred.resolve` with a different value than what was originally passed to the `fapply` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[deferred.resolve(null),...]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `deferred.resolve` with a different value than what was originally passed to the `fapply` method.

DONE.
