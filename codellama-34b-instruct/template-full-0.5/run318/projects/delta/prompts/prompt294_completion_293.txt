  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the next operation would be retrieved, instead of the current one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(index - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the previous operation would be retrieved, instead of the current one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(index * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the operation at twice the current index would be retrieved, instead of the current one.

DONE.
