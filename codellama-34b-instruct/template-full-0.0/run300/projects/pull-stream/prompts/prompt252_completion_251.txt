  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!_read
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `_read`, which would cause the `nextChunk()` function to be called even if `_read` is not defined, leading to a different control flow.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add 1 to the value of `_read`, which would cause the `nextChunk()` function to be called with a different argument, leading to a different control flow.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.length` property would return the length of the `_read` array, which would cause the `nextChunk()` function to be called with a different argument, leading to a different control flow.

DONE.
