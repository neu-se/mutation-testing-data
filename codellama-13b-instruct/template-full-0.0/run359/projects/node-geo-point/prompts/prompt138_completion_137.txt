  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude and longitude values would be swapped, which could cause issues in calculations that rely on the correct order of the values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude value would be incremented by 1, which could cause issues in calculations that rely on the correct latitude value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude value would be multiplied by 2, which could cause issues in calculations that rely on the correct latitude value.

DONE.
