  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite'] ? Complex['INFINITY'] : Complex['NAN'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `z` is infinite and returns `Complex['INFINITY']` in that case, while this modified code always returns `Complex['NAN']` regardless of whether `z` is infinite or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['NAN'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks multiple conditions to determine what to return, while this modified code always returns `Complex['NAN']` regardless of the input values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['INFINITY'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks multiple conditions to determine what to return, while this modified code always returns `Complex['INFINITY']` regardless of the input values.

DONE.
