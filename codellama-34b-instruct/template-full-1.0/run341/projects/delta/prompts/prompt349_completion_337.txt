  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.transform
```
This would result in different behavior because `AttributeMap.transform` has a different signature than `AttributeMap.invert` and would likely cause type errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.prototype.invert
```
This would result in different behavior because `AttributeMap.prototype.invert` is a method that is not called in the original code, and its behavior is not identical to the behavior of `AttributeMap.invert`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.prototype.transform
```
This would result in different behavior because `AttributeMap.prototype.transform` is a method that has a different behavior than `AttributeMap.invert` and `AttributeMap.transform`.

DONE.
