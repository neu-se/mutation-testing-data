Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index < this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if there are more operations based solely on the index and the length of the operations array, potentially allowing for an out-of-bounds access if the index is equal to the length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check if there are any remaining operations based on the length of the next operation, which could incorrectly indicate that there are no more operations when there are still valid operations left.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index >= this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return true when the index is equal to or greater than the length of the operations array, which would incorrectly indicate that there are no more operations available even if there are still valid operations at the current index.

DONE.
