  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
globPart + '*'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would glob all files in the directory instead of just the files matching the glob pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
globPart.split(',')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only glob the first file in the directory instead of all files matching the glob pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
globPart + '**'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would glob all files in the directory and all files in subdirectories instead of just the files matching the glob pattern.

DONE.
