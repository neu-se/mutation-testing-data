  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.makeNodeResolver()` is a different method than `this.dispatch()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.fapply()` is a different method than `this.dispatch()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.npost()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.npost()` is a different method than `this.dispatch()`.

DONE.
