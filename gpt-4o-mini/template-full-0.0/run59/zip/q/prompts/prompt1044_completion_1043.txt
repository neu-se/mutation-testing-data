Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.resolve("tail");
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly attempts to resolve the promise with a string instead of accessing the "tail" property, which would lead to unexpected behavior when trying to retrieve the next item from the queue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get("head", "tail");
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly passes two arguments to the `get` method instead of one, which may cause the method to fail or behave unexpectedly, as it is not designed to handle multiple parameters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get("tail");
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to access the "tail" property instead of the "head" property, which would lead to retrieving the wrong value from the promise and potentially breaking the queue's intended functionality.

DONE.
