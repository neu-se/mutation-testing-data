 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
global.emit
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `global` object's `emit` method, which might not be available or have the same functionality as the `process` object's `emit` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `process.emit` call with `null`, which would cause a runtime error when the function is called in the next tick.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
promise.emit
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `emit` method of the `promise` object, which is not guaranteed to exist or have the same functionality as the `process` object's `emit` method.

DONE.
