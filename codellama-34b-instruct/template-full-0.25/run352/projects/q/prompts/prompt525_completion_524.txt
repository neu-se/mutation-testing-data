  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would change the value of `op`, potentially causing the `dispatch` function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operator would change the value of `op`, potentially causing the `dispatch` function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator would change the value of `op`, potentially causing the `dispatch` function to behave differently.

DONE.
