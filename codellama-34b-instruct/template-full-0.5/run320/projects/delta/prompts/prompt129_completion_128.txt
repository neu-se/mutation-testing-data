  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method returns the next value in the iteration, whereas the original code fragment was simply accessing the `next` property of the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method with an argument returns the next `n` values in the iteration, whereas the original code fragment was only accessing the next value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method with a negative argument returns the previous `n` values in the iteration, whereas the original code fragment was only accessing the next value.

DONE.
