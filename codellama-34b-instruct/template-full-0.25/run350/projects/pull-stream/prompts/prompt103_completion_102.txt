  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add 1 to the value of `data`, whereas the original code fragment would simply log the value of `data` as is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would multiply the value of `data` by 2, whereas the original code fragment would simply log the value of `data` as is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property would return the length of the `data` array, whereas the original code fragment would simply log the value of `data` as is.

DONE.
