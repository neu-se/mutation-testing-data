  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.insert === 'object' &&
          typeof lastOp.insert === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `newOp.insert` and `lastOp.insert` are both strings, while this new code fragment checks if they are both objects. This would cause the code to behave differently if the `insert` property of an `Op` object is not a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert instanceof String &&
          lastOp.insert instanceof String
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `newOp.insert` and `lastOp.insert` are both strings, while this new code fragment checks if they are both instances of the `String` class. This would cause the code to behave differently if the `insert` property of an `Op` object is not a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert.length > 0
