  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'persons'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment singularizes the word "person," while the new code fragment would result in a plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'animal'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pluralizes the word "person," while the new code fragment would result in the same form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'peoples'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment singularizes the word "person," while the new code fragment would result in a different plural form.

DONE.
