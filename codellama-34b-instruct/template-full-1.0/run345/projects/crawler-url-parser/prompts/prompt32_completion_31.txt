  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the URL to use HTTPS instead of HTTP, which could cause issues with domain names that are not set up to work with SSL/TLS.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the URL to start with a double-slash, which could be interpreted as an absolute URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'file://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the URL to be treated as a file URL, which could cause issues with URLs that are not meant to be interpreted as files.

DONE.
