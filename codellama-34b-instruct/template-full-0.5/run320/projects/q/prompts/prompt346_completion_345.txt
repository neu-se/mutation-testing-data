  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw exception;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was not throwing an exception, and the new code fragment would cause the `rejected` callback to be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was not returning a rejected promise, and the new code fragment would cause the `rejected` callback to be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return resolve(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was not returning a resolved promise with the exception as its value, and the new code fragment would cause the `fulfilled` callback to be called with the exception as its value.

DONE.
