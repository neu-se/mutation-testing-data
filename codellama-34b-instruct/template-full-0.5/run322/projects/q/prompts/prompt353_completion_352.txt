  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function would be called with `null` instead of the actual exception, which could cause the error to go unnoticed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function would be called with a new error object instead of the actual exception, which could make it difficult to determine the root cause of the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function would be called with `undefined` instead of the actual exception, which could cause the error to go unnoticed.

DONE.
