 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delete this._data[row.key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly deletes the key from the `_data` object, bypassing the internal `delete` method of the Map object, which might have side effects or additional logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.clear()
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes all entries from the `_data` Map, not just the entry associated with the given key. This could lead to unintended data loss or other issues in the application.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(row.key, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the value of the key to `undefined` instead of deleting the key-value pair. This could lead to unexpected behavior in parts of the code that rely on the key being absent from the Map when its value is `undefined`.
