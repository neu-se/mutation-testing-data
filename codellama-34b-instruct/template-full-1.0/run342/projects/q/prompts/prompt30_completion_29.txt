  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` removes the first element of the array, whereas `pop` removes the last element. This could break the code's functionality if it relies on the assumption that the last element will be removed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.length = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it completely empties the array, whereas `shift` and `pop` only remove one element. This could break the code's functionality if it relies on the assumption that the array will have a certain number of elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.splice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the first element of the array, whereas `shift` and `pop` remove the last element. This could break the code's functionality if it relies on the assumption that the array will have a certain number of
