  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
any
```
This would result in different behavior because `any` will return `true` if any element in the array is truthy, whereas `all` will only return `true` if all elements in the array are truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
none
```
This would result in different behavior because `none` will return `true` if none of the elements in the array are truthy, whereas `all` will only return `true` if all elements in the array are truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
some
```
This would result in different behavior because `some` will return `true` if at least one element in the array is truthy, whereas `all` will only return `true` if all elements in the array are truthy.

DONE.
