  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function would return a value between -1 and 1, while `1 + cos` would return a value between 0 and 2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function would return a value between -1 and 1, while `cos` would return a value between -1 and 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the `1/cos` function would return a value between 0 and infinity, while `cos` would return a value between -1 and 1.

DONE.
