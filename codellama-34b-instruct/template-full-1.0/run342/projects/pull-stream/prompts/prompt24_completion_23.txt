  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the `pull` function would be used instead of the first argument, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `ref[1]` would be incremented by 1, which could affect the outcome of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `ref[1]` would be doubled, which could affect the outcome of the function.

DONE.
