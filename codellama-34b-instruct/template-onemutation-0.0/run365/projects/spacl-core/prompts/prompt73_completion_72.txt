  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, ctx.clone()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone()` method is not called in the original code fragment, which means that the `ctx` object is not cloned, and any changes made to the `ctx` object in the `query()` method would affect the original `ctx` object, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
