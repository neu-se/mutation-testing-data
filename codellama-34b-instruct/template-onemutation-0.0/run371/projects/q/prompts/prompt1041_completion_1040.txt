  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next.reject(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` returns a promise that is resolved with the provided value, but `next.reject()` rejects the promise with the provided error. This would cause the `get()` method to return a rejected promise instead of a resolved promise with the expected value.

DONE.
