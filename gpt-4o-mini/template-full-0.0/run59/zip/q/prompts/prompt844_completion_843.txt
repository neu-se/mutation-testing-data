Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Timeout occurred"
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of rejecting with an Error object, it would reject with a string message, which may not provide sufficient context for the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` would cause the promise to reject with a `TypeError` when trying to access properties of `null`, instead of rejecting with a proper timeout error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("Custom timeout error")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always reject with a new Error object with a fixed message, regardless of the timeout duration, instead of dynamically creating an error message based on the timeout duration.

DONE.
