  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of the values of an object's own enumerable string-keyed property values, whereas `Object.keys` returns an array of the keys of an object's own enumerable string-keyed property names.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys.toString().length
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys.toString().length` would return the length of the string representation of the `Object.keys` method, whereas `Object.keys.length` would return the number of elements in an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(Object.keys, 'length')
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(Object.keys, 'length')` would return `true` if `Object.keys` has an own property named "
