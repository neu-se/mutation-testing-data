  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value is not a valid argument for the `makeGenerator` function, which expects a function as its argument. Using `null` would cause the function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value is not a valid argument for the `makeGenerator` function, which expects a function as its argument. Using `undefined` would cause the function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `1` value is not a valid argument for the `makeGenerator` function, which expects a function as its argument. Using `1` would cause the function to throw an error.

DONE.
