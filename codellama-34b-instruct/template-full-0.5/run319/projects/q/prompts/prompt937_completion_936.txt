  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseArgs` array would have one element less than the original code, which could cause the `nodeArgs` array to have a different length and potentially break the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseArgs` array would have three elements more than the original code, which could cause the `nodeArgs` array to have a different length and potentially break the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseArgs` array would have zero elements, which would cause the `nodeArgs` array to have a different length and potentially break the code.

DONE.
