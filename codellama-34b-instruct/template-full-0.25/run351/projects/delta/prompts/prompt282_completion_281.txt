  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const otherOp = otherIter.next(length);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherOp` variable to be assigned the result of `otherIter.next(length)`, which would advance the iterator and return the next operation in the `other` delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const otherOp = otherIter.peek(length);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherOp` variable to be assigned the result of `otherIter.peek(length)`, which would return the next operation in the `other` delta without advancing the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const otherOp = otherIter.next(length + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherOp` variable to be assigned the result of `otherIter.next(length + 1)`, which would advance the iterator and return the next operation in the `other` delta
