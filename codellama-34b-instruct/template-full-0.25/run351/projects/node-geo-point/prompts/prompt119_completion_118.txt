  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `bearing` variable directly, while this modified code fragment adds 180 degrees to the `bearing` value before using it. This would cause the `calculateDestination` method to return a different result, which could potentially cause issues in the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `bearing` variable directly, while this modified code fragment multiplies the `bearing` value by 2 before using it. This would cause the `calculateDestination` method to return a different result, which could potentially cause issues in the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing - 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `bearing` variable directly
