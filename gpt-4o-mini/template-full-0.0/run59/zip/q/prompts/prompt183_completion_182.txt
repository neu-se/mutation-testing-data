Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!attempt1
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the truthiness of `attempt1`, causing the condition to always evaluate to `false`, which would prevent the function from returning the expected file name and line number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1 === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `attempt1` is strictly equal to `null`, which would not account for the case where `attempt1` is an empty array or undefined, leading to incorrect handling of valid stack lines.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `attempt1` is an empty array instead of checking if it is a valid match, which would incorrectly lead to the function returning `undefined` for valid stack lines that do match the regex.

DONE.
