Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the parser to proceed even when there are unbalanced plus and minus signs, potentially leading to incorrect parsing of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would trigger the parser exit when there are any plus or minus signs present, even if they are balanced, which could incorrectly terminate valid input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus - minus === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check for equality between plus and minus counts, which does not accurately reflect the requirement for them to be balanced, potentially allowing invalid input to be processed.

DONE.
