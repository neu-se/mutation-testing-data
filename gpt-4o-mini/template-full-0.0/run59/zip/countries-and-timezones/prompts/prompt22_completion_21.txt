Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.u + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the value used for `dstOffset` to be one more than the `utcOffset`, which could lead to incorrect daylight saving time calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.d + 10
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a constant value of 10 to `tz.d`, which could incorrectly inflate the daylight saving time offset, leading to erroneous results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets `dstOffset` to `null`, which is not a valid number and could cause downstream errors or unexpected behavior when formatting the offset string.

DONE.
