  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset * 60
```
This would result in different behavior because `offset / 60` would return a float representing the hours and minutes of the offset, whereas `offset * 60` would return a float representing the total minutes of the offset.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(offset / 60)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` would round the hours down to the nearest integer, whereas in the original code, the resulting hours value from `offset / 60` is used without rounding.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round(offset / 60)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.round` would round the hours to the nearest integer, whereas in the original code, the resulting hours value from `offset / 60` is used without rounding.

DONE.
