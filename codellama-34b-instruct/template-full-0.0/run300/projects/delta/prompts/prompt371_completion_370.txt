  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(thisIter.next()) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the length to be incremented by 1, which would cause the `while` loop to iterate one more time than it should.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(thisIter.next()) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the length to be decremented by 1, which would cause the `while` loop to iterate one fewer times than it should.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(thisIter.next()) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the length to be doubled, which would cause the `while` loop to iterate twice as many times as it should.

DONE.
