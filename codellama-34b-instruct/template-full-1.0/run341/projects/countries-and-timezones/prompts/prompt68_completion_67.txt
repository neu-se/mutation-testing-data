  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `!country` checks if the `country` variable is falsy (e.g., `undefined`, `null`, `false`, `0`, or an empty string), while `country === null` checks if the `country` variable is strictly equal to `null`. In the original code, `!country` is used to handle the case where the `country` variable is `undefined`, but `country === null` would not handle that case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!countries[country]
```
This would result in different behavior because `!country` checks if the `country` variable is falsy, while `!countries[country]` checks if the `country` variable is not a key in the `countries` object. In the original code, `!country` is used to handle the case where the `country` variable is not a valid country, but `!countries[country]` would not handle that case.
