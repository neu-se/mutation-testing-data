  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `extract` function expects a `currentUrl` object to be returned from the `parse` function, but `null` would be returned instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because the `extract` function expects a `currentUrl` object to be returned from the `parse` function, but only the `protocol` property of the object would be returned instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because the `extract` function expects a `currentUrl` object to be returned from the `parse` function, but only the `host` property of the object would be returned instead.

DONE.
