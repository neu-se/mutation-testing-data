  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
5
```
This would result in different behavior because the power operation would return a different result. Instead of raising 10 to the power of `places`, which would give us 100, this code would raise 5 to the power of `places`, which would give us 3125.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0.1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would divide the complex number by a different value. Instead of dividing by 10, which would give us the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, this code would divide by 0.1, which would give us the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, but with a lower magnitude.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would attempt to reference a null or undefined value. Instead of referencing the complex number, this code would reference a null or undefined value, which would cause the
