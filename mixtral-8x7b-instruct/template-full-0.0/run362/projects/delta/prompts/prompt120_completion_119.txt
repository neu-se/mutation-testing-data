 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `changeLength` method would no longer correctly subtract the `delete` property of the current element in the accumulator when iterating over the `ops` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `changeLength` method would incorrectly subtract 1 from the accumulator when encountering a `delete` operation, regardless of the value of `elem.delete`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(elem.delete)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `changeLength` method would always subtract the absolute value of `elem.delete`, which could lead to incorrect results when `elem.delete` is negative.

DONE.
