  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"targetFilePath" + ".zip"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a file with the exact name provided in the `targetFilePath` parameter, while this modified code fragment adds a ".zip" extension to the file name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"targetFilePath" + ".tar"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a file with the exact name provided in the `targetFilePath` parameter, while this modified code fragment adds a ".tar" extension to the file name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"targetFilePath" + ".txt"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a file with the exact name provided in the `targetFilePath` parameter, while this modified code fragment adds a ".txt" extension to the file name.

DONE.
