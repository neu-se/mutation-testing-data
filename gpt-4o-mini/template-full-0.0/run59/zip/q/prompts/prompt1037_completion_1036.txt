Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because initializing `ends` with `null` would cause the `ends.promise` to be undefined, leading to runtime errors when trying to access properties like `get("head")` in the `get` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because setting `ends` to `undefined` would prevent the `ends.promise` from being a valid object, causing the `get` method to fail when it attempts to call `get("head")`, resulting in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve({ head: null, tail: null })
```
This would result in different behavior because initializing `ends` with a resolved promise containing `null` values would mean that the queue would not hold any valid data, and any calls to `get` would return `null`, which may not be the intended behavior of the queue.

DONE.
