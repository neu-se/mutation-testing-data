  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.promiseDispatch.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` and `apply` are different methods of calling a function, and using `call` instead of `apply` could cause the function to be called with the wrong context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.promiseDispatch.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` returns a new function that is bound to the provided context, while `apply` and `call` call the function immediately. Using `bind` instead of `apply` or `call` could cause the function to be called with the wrong context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.promiseDispatch.bind(newPromise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` returns a new function that is bound to the provided context, while `apply` and `call` call the function immediately. Using `bind` with the `newPromise`
