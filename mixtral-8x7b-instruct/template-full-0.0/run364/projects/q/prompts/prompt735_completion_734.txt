 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` helper function would not receive the array of promises as an argument, but instead an immediately resolved promise. This would cause the `all` function to treat the input as a single resolved promise instead of an array of promises, leading to different resolved value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return all(this); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the context (`this`) of the `all` function call. Depending on the context in which the promise is called, it might lead to different resolved values or unexpected errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject(new Error('Buggy replacement'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be immediately rejected with an error, instead of waiting for the array of promises to resolve. This would cause the test suite to fail, indicating that the error handling
