  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isNaN()` function to always return `true`, which would cause the `isInfinite()` function to always return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isNaN()` function to always return `false`, which would cause the `isInfinite()` function to always return `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isNaN()` function to always return `false`, which would cause the `isInfinite()` function to always return `true`.

DONE.
