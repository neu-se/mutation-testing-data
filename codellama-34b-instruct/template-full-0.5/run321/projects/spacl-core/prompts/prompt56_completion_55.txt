  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.split
```
This would result in different behavior because `split` is a method that returns an array of substrings, while `replace` is a method that returns a new string with some or all matches of a pattern replaced by a replacement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(1)` returns a new string that is a substring of the original string, starting from the second character, while `replace` returns a new string with some or all matches of a pattern replaced by a replacement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is a method that returns an array of matches found in a string, while `replace` returns a new string with some or all matches of a pattern replaced by a replacement.

DONE.
