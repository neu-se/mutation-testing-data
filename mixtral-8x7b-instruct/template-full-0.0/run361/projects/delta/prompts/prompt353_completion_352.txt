 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
inverted.chop();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment, `inverted.chop`, is missing the parentheses to actually call the `chop` method, making it a no-op. By adding the parentheses, the `chop` method will be called, potentially changing the behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
inverted.slice();
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` is not a method of the `Delta` class, and therefore will throw an error when executed. This exposes a missing error check in the code, which assumes that the `inverted` object has a `chop` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Math.random();
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` returns a random float between 0 and 1, which is not the intended behavior of
