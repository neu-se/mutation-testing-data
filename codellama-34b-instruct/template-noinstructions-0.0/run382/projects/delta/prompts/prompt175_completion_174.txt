  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter.peekLength()` method to be called instead of the `thisIter.peekLength()` method, which could potentially return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `thisIter.peekLength()` method to be called instead of the `otherIter.peekLength()` method, which could potentially return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.min(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Math.min()` method to be called with the return values of `thisIter.peekLength()` and `otherIter.peekLength()`, which could potentially return a different value than the original code fragment.

DONE.
