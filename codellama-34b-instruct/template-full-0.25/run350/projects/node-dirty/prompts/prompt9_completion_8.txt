  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, val);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `set` method to always set the value of the key to `val`, regardless of whether `val` is undefined or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, val + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `set` method to always set the value of the key to `val + 1`, regardless of whether `val` is undefined or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, val * 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `set` method to always set the value of the key to `val * 2`, regardless of whether `val` is undefined or not.

DONE.
