  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is no longer being passed directly to the callback function. Instead, the value of `end + 1` is being passed, which could cause the callback function to be called with a different value than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is no longer being passed directly to the callback function. Instead, the value of `end - 1` is being passed, which could cause the callback function to be called with a different value than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is no longer being passed directly to the callback function. Instead, the value of `end * 2` is being passed, which could cause the callback function to be called with a different value than expected.

DONE.
