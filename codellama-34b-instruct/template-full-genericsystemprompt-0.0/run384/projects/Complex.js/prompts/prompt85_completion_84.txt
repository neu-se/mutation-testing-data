  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] = /* void */
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment assigned a value to `z['im']`, while this replacement code fragment does not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment assigned a value to `z['im']`, while this replacement code fragment assigns a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] = NaN;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment assigned a value to `z['im']`, while this replacement code fragment assigns a different value.

DONE.
