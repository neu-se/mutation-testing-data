  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the map to the name of the policy, rather than the policy object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the map to the lowercase version of the policy name, rather than the policy object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the map to an array of characters in the policy name, rather than the policy object itself.

DONE.
