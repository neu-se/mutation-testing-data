  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would return an empty object, causing the `retain` method to be called with a length of 0, which would not have the same effect as calling `retain` with the original length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would return an object with a negative length, which would cause an error when trying to call the `retain` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would return `null`, which would cause an error when trying to call the `retain` method.

DONE.
