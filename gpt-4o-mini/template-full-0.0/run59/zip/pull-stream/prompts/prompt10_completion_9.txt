Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'function' && a.length !== 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `a` is a function with a length that is not equal to 1, which would allow the code block to execute even when `a` is a valid function with a length of 1, thus potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a !== 'function' || a.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `a` is not a function or if its length is 0, which would allow the code block to execute even when `a` is a valid function with a length greater than 0, thus bypassing the intended logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'object' && a.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly checks if `a` is an object with a length of 1, which would allow the code block to execute for objects instead of functions, leading to incorrect handling of the input
