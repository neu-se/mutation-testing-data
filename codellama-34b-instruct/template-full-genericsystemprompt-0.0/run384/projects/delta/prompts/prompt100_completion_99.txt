  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp && typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' && lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is removed, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `lastOp.attributes` is `null` or `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp && typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' && lastOp.attributes === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is replaced with `=== null`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` only if `lastOp.attributes` is `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp && typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' && lastOp.attributes === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is replaced with `=== undefined`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` only
