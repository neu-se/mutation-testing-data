  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with different code fragments:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var b = this['im'];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would perform a different operation on the "im" property of the "this" object, which could potentially alter the way the code is executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var b = Math.sin(this['im']);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would perform a different mathematical operation on the "im" property of the "this" object, which could potentially alter the way the code is executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var b = this['im'] + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the "im" property of the "this" object, which could potentially alter the way the code is executed.

DONE.
