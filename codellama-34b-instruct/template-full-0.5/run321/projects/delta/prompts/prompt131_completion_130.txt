  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a null value to the ops array, which would cause the slice method to return a Delta object with a null value as the last element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push(newOp.insert);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the insert value of the newOp object to the ops array, which would cause the slice method to return a Delta object with a different set of elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push({ retain: newOp.retain });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a new object with a retain property to the ops array, which would cause the slice method to return a Delta object with a different set of elements.

DONE.
