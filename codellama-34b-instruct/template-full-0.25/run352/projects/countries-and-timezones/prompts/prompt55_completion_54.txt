  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deprecated` property of the `options` object would be set to `true`, which would cause the `deliverTimezones` function to return all timezones, including deprecated ones, instead of only returning non-deprecated timezones.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deprecated` property of the `options` object would be set to `false`, which would cause the `deliverTimezones` function to return only non-deprecated timezones, instead of all timezones.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = !options.deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deprecated` property of the `options` object would be inverted, causing the `deliverTimezones` function
