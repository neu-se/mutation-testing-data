  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.isInfinite()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite()` is a method that checks if the complex number is infinite, while `isInfinite` is a property that indicates whether the complex number is infinite or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.isZero()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isZero()` is a method that checks if the complex number is zero, while `isZero` is a property that indicates whether the complex number is zero or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.isNaN()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN()` is a method that checks if the complex number is not a number (NaN), while `isNaN` is a property that indicates whether the complex number is NaN or not.

DONE.
