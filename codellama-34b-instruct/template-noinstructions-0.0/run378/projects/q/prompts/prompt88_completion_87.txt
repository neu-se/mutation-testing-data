  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `arguments` is an array-like object that contains the arguments passed to the function, while the new code fragment `[]` is an empty array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `arguments` is an array-like object that contains the arguments passed to the function, while the new code fragment `null` is a null value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `arguments` is an array-like object that contains the arguments passed to the function, while the new code fragment `undefined` is an undefined value.

DONE.
