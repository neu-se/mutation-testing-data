  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (r - a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the formula for the complex square root would be incorrect, leading to incorrect results for certain input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (r + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the formula for the complex square root would be incorrect, leading to incorrect results for certain input values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (r + a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the formula for the complex square root would be incorrect, leading to incorrect results for certain input values.

DONE.
