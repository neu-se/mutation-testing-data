 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ended
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.ended` refers to the `ended` property of the current object, while the original code refers to the global `ended` variable. This change could cause the function to behave incorrectly if the `ended` property and the global `ended` variable have different values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.ended
```
This would result in different behavior because `data.ended` refers to the `ended` property of the `data` object, while the original code refers to the global `ended` variable. This change could cause the function to behave incorrectly if the `data.ended` property and the global `ended` variable have different values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop('ended')
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop('ended')` returns a function that retrieves the value of the `ended` property of an object, while the original code
