 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.assign({}, this.verbs)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of the `verbs` object, and any modifications to the new object won't affect the original `verbs` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.verbs.slice()
