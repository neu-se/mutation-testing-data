  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.all
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the current object, while `this.all` would refer to the `all` method of the current object, which could potentially have a different implementation than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.any
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.any` would refer to the `any` method of the current object, which could potentially have a different implementation than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.allResolved
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.allResolved` would refer to the `allResolved` method of the current object, which could potentially have a different implementation than the original code.

DONE.
