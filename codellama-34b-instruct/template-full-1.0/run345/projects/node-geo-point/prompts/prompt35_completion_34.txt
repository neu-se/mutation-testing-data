  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because `point1Rad` and `point2Rad` are different variables representing the radian values of the two latitudes, and using `point2Rad` instead of `point1Rad` would cause the calculation to use the wrong latitude value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1Rad + point2Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the calculation to use the sum of the radian values of the two latitudes, which is not correct.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(point1Rad - point2Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the calculation to use the sine of the difference between the radian values of the two latitudes, which is not correct.

DONE.
