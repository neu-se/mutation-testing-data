  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the iterator would be incremented by 2 instead of 1, potentially skipping over the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the iterator would be decremented by 1, potentially causing the iterator to point to the wrong operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the iterator would be incremented by 2, potentially causing the iterator to point to the wrong operation.

DONE.
