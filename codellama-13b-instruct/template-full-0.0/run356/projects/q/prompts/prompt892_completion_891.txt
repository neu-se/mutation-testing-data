  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nfapply(FS.readFile, [__filename])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.nfapply` function is used to call the `FS.readFile` function with the `__filename` argument, which is a string representing the path to the current file. The original code fragment uses the `Q` function to call the `FS.readFile` function with the `__filename` argument, which is a string representing the path to the current file. However, the `Q.nfapply` function is used in the original code fragment, which is not the same as the `Q` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nfcall(FS.readFile, __filename)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.nfcall` function is used to call the `FS.readFile` function with the `__filename` argument, which is a string representing the path to the current file. The original code fragment uses the `Q` function to call
