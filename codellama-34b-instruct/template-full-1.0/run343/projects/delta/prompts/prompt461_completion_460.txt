  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[next].slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` would create a new array from the current index to the end of the original array, whereas `concat` would concatenate the current array with another array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[next].filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` would remove elements from the current array that do not match the provided filter function, whereas `concat` would concatenate the current array with another array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[next].map
```
This would result in different behavior because `map` would create a new array with the results of the provided function called on each element of the current array, whereas `concat` would concatenate the current array with another array.

DONE.
