 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the arguments passed to the `dispatch` method, causing the method to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"nonexistentMethod"
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to call a nonexistent method, which would throw a `TypeError` and cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[key, Q(value)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps the `value` in a promise, which would cause the `set` method to behave differently than expected.

DONE.
