  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.close(this._writeStream);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would close the write stream immediately, rather than waiting for it to drain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.close(this._readStream);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would close the read stream immediately, rather than waiting for it to close.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.close(this._queue);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would close the queue immediately, rather than waiting for it to be empty.

DONE.
