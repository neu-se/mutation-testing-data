  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because when `deferred.reject` is called and `deferred.reject` is called instead of `deferred.resolve`. The promise will be resolved with the error rather than rejected with the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with the error rather than resolving the promise. `Q.reject` and `deferred.reject` have different semantics.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the error would not be handled.

DONE.
