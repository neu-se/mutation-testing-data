  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^\/]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any character that is not a forward slash, while the new code fragment matches any character that is not a forward slash or a backslash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/[^\/]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any character that is not a forward slash, while the new code fragment matches any character that is not a forward slash or a backslash, and also includes a forward slash at the beginning of the match.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^/]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any character that is not a forward slash, while the new code fragment matches any character that is not a forward slash or a backslash, and also includes a forward slash at the beginning of the match.

DONE.
