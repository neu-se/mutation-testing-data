  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(this, point);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<PLACEHOLDER>` function is not defined in the provided code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return GeoPoint.calculateBearing(point, this);
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, which could cause the function to return an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return GeoPoint.calculateBearing(this, point) * 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the result of the function is multiplied by 2, which could cause the function to return an incorrect result.

DONE.
