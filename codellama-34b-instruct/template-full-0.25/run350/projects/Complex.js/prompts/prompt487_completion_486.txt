  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex.prototype.isFinite = function() { return false; };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isFinite` method to always return `false`, even if the complex number is actually finite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex.prototype.isInfinite = function() { return true; };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isInfinite` method to always return `true`, even if the complex number is actually finite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex.prototype.isNaN = function() { return true; };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isNaN` method to always return `true`, even if the complex number is actually a valid number.

DONE.
