```
This would result in different behavior because the method would always return true instead of checking the number of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the method would always return false instead of checking the number of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the method would always return false instead of checking the number of arguments.

DONE.
