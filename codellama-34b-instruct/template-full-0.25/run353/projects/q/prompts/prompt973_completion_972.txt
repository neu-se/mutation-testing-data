  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nfcall(FS.readFile, __filename)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nfcall` is a different method than `Q`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nfapply(FS.readFile, [__filename])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nfapply` is a different method than `Q.nfcall`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nbind(FS.readFile, __filename)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nbind` is a different method than `Q.nfcall`.

DONE.
