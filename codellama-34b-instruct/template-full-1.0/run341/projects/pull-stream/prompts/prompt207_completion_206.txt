  Sure, here are three options for replacing the `PLACEHOLDER` in the `asyncMap` function with a buggy code fragment:

Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('AbortError')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always abort the map function with an `AbortError`, regardless of whether the abort parameter was passed to the function.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
if (aborted) { cb(aborted) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only call the `cb` function if the `aborted` parameter was truthy, but it would not pass the `abort` parameter to the `cb` function.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
cb(aborted)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with the `aborted` parameter, but it would not check if the `aborted` parameter was truthy before doing so
