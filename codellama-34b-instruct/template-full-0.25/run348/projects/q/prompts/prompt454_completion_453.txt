  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(no stack) " + reason.message
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only include the message property of the reason object, rather than the entire object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(no stack) " + reason.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the stack property of the reason object, which may contain additional information about the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(no stack) " + reason.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the toString() method of the reason object, which may return a different string representation of the error.

DONE.
