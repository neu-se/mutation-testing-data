```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the mutation would not return any value from 'next', throwing an exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push(thisIter.next())
```
This would result in different behavior because the mutation would be calling push on the wrong delta object, not the one used to hold the partial result of the composition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherIter.next())
```
This would result in different behavior because the mutation would be calling push on the wrong iterator, which will result in adding the incorrect elements to the composition result.

DONE.
