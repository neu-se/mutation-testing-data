  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write(data, (err) => {
    if (err != null) this.emit('error', err);
    if (--this._inFlightWrites <= 0 && !this._waitForDrain) this.emit('drain');
    for (const cb of cbs) cb();
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the callbacks to be invoked regardless of whether there was an error writing to the stream, whereas the original code only invoked the callbacks if there was no error.

this._writeStream.write(data, (err) => {
    if (err == null) this.emit('error', err);
    if (--this._inFlightWrites <= 0 && !this._waitForDrain) this.emit('drain');
    for (const cb of cbs) cb();
