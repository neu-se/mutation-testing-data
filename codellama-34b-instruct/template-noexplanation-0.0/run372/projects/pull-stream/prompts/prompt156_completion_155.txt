Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value == null
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if `value` is `null` or `undefined`, and `false` otherwise. This will result in the `if` block being executed if `value` is `null` or `undefined`, and the `else` block being
