 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
part.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first character of the property name, causing issues when trying to extract the property value from the matched string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
part.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an empty string for property names, causing issues when trying to extract the property value from the matched string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
part.slice(part.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return an empty string, causing issues when trying to extract the property value from the matched string.

DONE.
