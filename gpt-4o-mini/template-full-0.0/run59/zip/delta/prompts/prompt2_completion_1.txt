Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof b === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly allow the function to proceed with an invalid `b` value (e.g., a primitive type), potentially leading to unexpected results when trying to clone or manipulate `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if `b` is strictly `null`, allowing other non-object types (like arrays or functions) to pass through, which could lead to errors later in the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat arrays as valid objects, which could lead to incorrect handling of the `b` parameter when the function is expected to work with plain objects only.

DONE.
