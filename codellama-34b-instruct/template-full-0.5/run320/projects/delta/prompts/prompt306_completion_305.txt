  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the length of the line, which could cause the code to skip over the last character in the line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the length of the line, which could cause the code to read beyond the end of the line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the length of the line, which could cause the code to read the same character twice.

DONE.
