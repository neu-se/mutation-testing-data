  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clearInterval
```
This would result in different behavior because `clearInterval` is used to stop the execution of functions on a set interval, whereas `clearTimeout` is used to stop the execution of functions after a set amount of time.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(() => {throw error;});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment clears the timeout, whereas this code would throw an error after a set amount of time.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void setTimeout(void 0, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment clears the timeout, whereas this code would schedule a new timeout that does nothing.

DONE.
