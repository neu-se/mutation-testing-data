  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === false ? null : abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `abort` is `true` or `false`, but this replacement checks if it is `false` or `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort ? null : undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `null` if `abort` is `true`, but this replacement returns `undefined` if `abort` is `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort ? null : abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `null` if `abort` is `true`, but this replacement returns `abort` if `abort` is `true`.

DONE.
