  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url, currentUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because the `url` property is being added to the map twice, which could cause issues if the map is being used to track unique URLs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url, currentUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because the `host` property is being used instead of the `url` property, which could cause issues if the map is being used to track unique URLs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url, currentUrl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path` property is being used instead of the `url` property, which could cause issues if the map is being used to track unique URLs.

DONE.
