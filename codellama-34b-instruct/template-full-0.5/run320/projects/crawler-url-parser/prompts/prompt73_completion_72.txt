  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'src'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `src` attribute is used for specifying the URL of an image, while the `href` attribute is used for specifying the URL of a link.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'text'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `text` attribute is used for specifying the text content of an element, while the `href` attribute is used for specifying the URL of a link.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'rel'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rel` attribute is used for specifying the relationship between the current document and the linked document, while the `href` attribute is used for specifying the URL of a link.

DONE.
