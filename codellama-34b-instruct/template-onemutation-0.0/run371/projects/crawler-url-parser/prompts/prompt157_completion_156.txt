  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "");
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is not the same as the one used in the original code fragment. The regular expression in the original code fragment matches a forward slash followed by any number of non-forward slash characters, followed by an optional forward slash at the end of the string. The regular expression in the buggy code fragment matches a forward slash followed by any number of non-forward slash characters, followed by an optional forward slash at the end of the string, and then replaces the entire match with an empty string. This would cause the `pageurl_path` variable to be modified in a different way than the original code fragment, which could potentially cause the `gettype` function to return a different value.
