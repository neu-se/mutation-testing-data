 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arg` method would return the angle based on the imaginary part instead of the real part of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arg` method would always return 0, regardless of the input complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arg` method would return a random number between 0 and 1, instead of the angle of the complex number.

By introducing these changes, the mutation testing aims to reveal potential weaknesses in the test suite, encouraging developers to improve their tests and ensure comprehensive test coverage.
