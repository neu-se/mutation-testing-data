  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  predicate(line, {}, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `predicate` function with an empty object as the second argument, instead of passing the attributes of the line. The `predicate` function might have different behavior for different attributes, which could cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  predicate(line, { insert: 'test' }, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `predicate` function with an object containing an `insert` property with the value `'test'`, instead of passing the actual attributes of the line. The `predicate` function might have different behavior for different attributes, which could cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  predicate(line, { delete: 'test' }, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `predicate` function with an object containing a `delete` property with
