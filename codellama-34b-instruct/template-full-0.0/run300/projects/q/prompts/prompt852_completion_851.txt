  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `error`, which would throw an error if `deferred.reject` is called with no arguments. However, if `null` is used instead, it would not throw an error, and the promise would be rejected with a value of `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `error`, which would throw an error if `deferred.reject` is called with no arguments. However, if `undefined` is used instead, it would not throw an error, and the promise would be rejected with a value of `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `error`, which would throw an error if `deferred.reject` is called with no arguments. However, if `"error"` is used instead, it would not throw an
