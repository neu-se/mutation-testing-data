  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, null
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb` is a callback function that is expected to be called with two arguments, `end` and `data`. By replacing it with `null`, the callback function will not be called with the expected arguments, which could cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function and cannot be called with the expected arguments. This would cause an error and the test would fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because `'foo'` is a string and cannot be called with the expected arguments. This would cause an error and the test would fail.

DONE.
