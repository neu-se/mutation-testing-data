  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolved
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejected` and `resolved` are opposing states in a promise, and replacing `rejected` with `resolved` would cause the promise to resolve instead of reject, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject("Error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject()` is a method that rejects the promise with a specific error message, whereas `rejected` is a parameter that is passed to the `onRejected` callback function. Replacing `rejected` with `deferred.reject()` would cause the promise to be rejected with a specific error message, which could lead to different behavior in the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw new Error()` is a statement that throws
