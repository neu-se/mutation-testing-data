  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `name` is a string and `undefined` is a primitive value, so the comparison would always return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `name.length` would return the length of the string `name`, which would be `0` if `name` is an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.trim() === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because `name.trim()` would remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the string `name`, and then compare it to an empty string. If `name` contains only whitespace, the comparison would return `true`.

DONE.
