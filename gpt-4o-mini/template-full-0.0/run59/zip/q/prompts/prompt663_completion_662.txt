Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, arguments[1]]
```
This would result in different behavior because it only uses the second argument from the `arguments` object instead of all arguments starting from the second one, potentially omitting necessary parameters for the method invocation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the arguments with `null`, which would lead to the method being called with a `null` value instead of the actual arguments, likely causing errors or unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 0)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses all arguments starting from the first one instead of the second, which could lead to incorrect method invocation as it may include the method name itself as an argument.

DONE.
