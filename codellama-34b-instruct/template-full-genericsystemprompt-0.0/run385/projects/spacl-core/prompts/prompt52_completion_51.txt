  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push an empty string onto the `parts` array, instead of the original code fragment which pushes the current part of the path onto the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push `undefined` onto the `parts` array, instead of the original code fragment which pushes the current part of the path onto the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push `null` onto the `parts` array, instead of the original code fragment which pushes the current part of the path onto the array.

DONE.
