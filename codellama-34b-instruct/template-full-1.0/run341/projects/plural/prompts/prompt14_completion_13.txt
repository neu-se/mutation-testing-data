  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `substr` method is called with `startIndex` as `0` and `length` as `w.length - 1`, which means that the first letter of the word is not included in the result. If `1` is used instead of `0`, the first letter of the word would be included in the result, which would change the resulting plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `substr` method is called with `startIndex` as `w.length - 1` and `length` as `0`, which means that the last letter of the word is not included in the result. If `-1` is used instead of `0`, the last letter of the word would be included in the result, which would change the resulting plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
