  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.then` is a function that returns a promise, whereas `object` is an object that may or may not have a `then` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.then()
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.then()` is a function that returns a promise, whereas `object` is an object that may or may not have a `then` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.then(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.then(function() {})` is a function that returns a promise, whereas `object` is an object that may or may not have a `then` method.

DONE.
