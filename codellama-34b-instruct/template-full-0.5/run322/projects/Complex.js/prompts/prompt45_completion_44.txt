  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks the type of the variable `a`, while the new code fragment adds `a` and `b` together.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks the type of the variable `a`, while the new code fragment subtracts `b` from `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks the type of the variable `a`, while the new code fragment multiplies `a` by `b`.

DONE.
