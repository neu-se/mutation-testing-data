  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log(a*a + b*b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the logarithm of the hypotenuse of the complex number, which is not the same as the logarithm of the absolute value of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log(a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the logarithm of the sum of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, which is not the same as the logarithm of the absolute value of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log(a - b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the logarithm of the difference of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, which is not the same as the logarithm of the absolute value of the complex number.

DONE.
