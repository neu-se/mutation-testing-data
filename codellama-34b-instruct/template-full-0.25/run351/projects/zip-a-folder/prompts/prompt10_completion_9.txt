  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isGlob
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `isGlob` function, so if the `src` parameter is a glob, the `!isGlob` expression would evaluate to `false`, and the code would enter the `else` block, which is not the expected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isGlob` function is being called with the `src` parameter, which is not the expected behavior. The `isGlob` function is used to check if the `src` parameter is a glob, but it is not being used correctly in this context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.includes('*')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `includes` method is being used to check if the `src` parameter includes the `*` character, which is not the expected behavior
