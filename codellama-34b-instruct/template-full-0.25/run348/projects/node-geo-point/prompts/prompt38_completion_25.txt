  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin` and `cos` are inverse trigonometric functions, and using `sin` instead of `cos` would cause the calculation of the distance between two points to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `tan` and `cos` have different ranges and are not interchangeable in this context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `acos` is the inverse of `cos`, and using it instead of `cos` would cause the calculation of the distance between two points to be incorrect.

DONE.
