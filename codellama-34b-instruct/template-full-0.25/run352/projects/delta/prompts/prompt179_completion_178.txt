  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.next()` would return the next operation in the iterator, whereas `thisIter.next` would return a reference to the `next` method itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next()` would return the next operation in the `other` iterator, whereas `thisIter.next` would return a reference to the `next` method of the `this` iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new OpIterator(this.ops).next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `new OpIterator(this.ops).next()` would return the next operation in a new iterator created from the `this.ops` array, whereas `thisIter.next` would return the next operation in the existing `thisIter` iterator.

DONE.
