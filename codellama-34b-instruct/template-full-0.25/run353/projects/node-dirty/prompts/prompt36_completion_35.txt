  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, val] = this._data.entries().next().value;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only iterate over the first entry in the map, rather than all entries.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, val] = this._data.entries().next().value;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only iterate over the first entry in the map, rather than all entries.
