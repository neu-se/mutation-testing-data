  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(1.0) / d
```
This would result in different behavior because the division by zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Math.sin(b) / d
```
This would result in different behavior because the division by zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sinh(a) / d
```
This would result in different behavior because the division by zero.

DONE.
