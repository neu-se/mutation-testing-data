 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` condition would always evaluate to `false`, and the `else` block would be executed, which initializes `ses.makeQ` with the Q API, instead of setting the global `Q` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty arrow function would always return `undefined`, making the `if` condition evaluate to `false`, and the `else` block would be executed, which initializes `ses.makeQ` with the Q API, instead of setting the global `Q` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Date()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` condition would always evaluate to `false`, and the `else` block would be executed, which initializes `ses.makeQ` with the Q API, instead of setting the global `Q` variable. Additionally,
