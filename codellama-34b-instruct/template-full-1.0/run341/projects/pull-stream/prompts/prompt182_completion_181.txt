  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 cb(abort), abort, onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls `cb` with one argument (`null` or `array[i++]`) while the mutated code fragment calls it with two arguments (`abort` and `onAbort`).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 cb(null, abort), abort, onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls `cb` with two arguments (`null` and `array[i++]`) while the mutated code fragment calls it with three arguments (`null`, `abort`, and `onAbort`).
