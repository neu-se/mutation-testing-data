 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.onerror` function is replaced with an empty function, which means that any unhandled errors will not be handled at all, and the error will be swallowed silently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.onerror` function is replaced with `null`, which would throw a `TypeError` when the `onerror` property is accessed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.onerror = function () {};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.onerror` function is replaced with a new function that does nothing, which means that any unhandled errors will not be handled at all, and the error will be swallowed silently.

DONE.
