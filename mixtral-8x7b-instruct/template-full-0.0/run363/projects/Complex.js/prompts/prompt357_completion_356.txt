 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` returns a value between -1 and 1, while `cosh` returns a positive value for any real argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(-a) * 0.5
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates `e^(-a) / 2` instead of `(e^c + e^(-c)) / 2`, changing the result significantly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / Math.sinh(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the reciprocal of `sinh(a)`, which is not equivalent to `cosh(a)`.

DONE.
