 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `callback` function is not being called, and instead an empty function is being used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback || function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because if `callback` is falsy, an empty function will be used instead, which might not have the same effect as the original `callback` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { throw new Error('Callback should not be called') }
