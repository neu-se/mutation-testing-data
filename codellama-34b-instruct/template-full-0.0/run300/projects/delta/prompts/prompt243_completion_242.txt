  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method would be called with a different argument, which could affect the length of the peeked operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method would be called on a different iterator, which could affect the length of the peeked operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method would be called without an argument, which could affect the length of the peeked operation.

DONE.
