  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer(true)` would always return a resolved promise, whereas `defer()` returns a deferred promise that can be resolved or rejected later.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer(false)` would always return a rejected promise, whereas `defer()` returns a deferred promise that can be resolved or rejected later.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer(null)` would always return a resolved promise with a value of `null`, whereas `defer()` returns a deferred promise that can be resolved or rejected later.

DONE.
