  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert === otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for strict equality instead of deep equality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert != otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for inequality instead of equality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert !== otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for strict inequality instead of deep equality.

DONE.
