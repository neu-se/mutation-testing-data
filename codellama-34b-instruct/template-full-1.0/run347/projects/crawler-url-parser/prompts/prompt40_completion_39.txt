  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.path === null && baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `parsedUrl.path` property is `null` and if it is, it would use `baseUrlStr` as the variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.protocol === null && baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `parsedUrl.protocol` property is `null` and if it is, it would use `baseUrlStr` as the variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host === null && baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `parsedUrl.host` property is `null` and if it is, it would use `baseUrlStr` as the variable.

DONE.
