  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `country` variable is `null` or `undefined`, whereas the original code only checks if it's falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `country` variable is `undefined`, whereas the original code only checks if it's falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!country.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `country` variable is an empty array, whereas the original code only checks if it's falsy.

DONE.
