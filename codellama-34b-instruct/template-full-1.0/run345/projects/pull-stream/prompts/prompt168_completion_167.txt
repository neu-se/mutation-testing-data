  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an array, and `Array.isArray(null)` returns `false`, which means the `array.map()` method will not be called, and the function will return a function that always returns `true`, even if `abort` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not an array, and `Array.isArray(undefined)` returns `false`, which means the `array.map()` method will not be called, and the function will return a function that always returns `true`, even if `abort` is `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because `[]` is an empty array, and `Array.isArray([]))` returns `true`, which means the `array.map()` method will be called, and the function will return a function that
