  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options` is an object with properties that are used in the `stringify` function, while `null` is a primitive value that does not have any properties. Using `null` would cause the `stringify` function to throw an error, which would result in different behavior than the original code.

DONE.
