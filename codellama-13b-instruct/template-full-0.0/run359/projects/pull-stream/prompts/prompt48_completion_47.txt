  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would run in reverse.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would run in a different order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = i * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would run a different number of times.

DONE.
