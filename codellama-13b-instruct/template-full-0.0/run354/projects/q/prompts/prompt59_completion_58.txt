  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would no longer check if the `window` object is defined, which could cause errors in environments where `window` is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would no longer check if the `window` object is an object, which could cause errors in environments where `window` is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would no longer check if the `window` object is a function, which could cause errors in environments where `window` is not a function.

DONE.
