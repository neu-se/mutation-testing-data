  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `args` array as a single argument to the `nfapply` method, while replacing it with `null` would pass `null` as the first argument and `args` as the second argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `args` array as a single argument to the `nfapply` method, while replacing it with `undefined` would pass `undefined` as the first argument and `args` as the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `args` array as a single argument to the `nfapply` method, while replacing it with an empty array `[]` would pass an empty array as the first argument and `args` as the second argument.

DONE.
