  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.message
```
This would result in different behavior because `exception.message` is a string representing the error message, while `exception.value` is the value that was thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because `exception.stack` is a string representing the stack trace at the time the error was thrown, while `exception.value` is the value that was thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.name
```
This would result in different behavior because `exception.name` is a string representing the name of the error, while `exception.value` is the value that was thrown.

DONE.
