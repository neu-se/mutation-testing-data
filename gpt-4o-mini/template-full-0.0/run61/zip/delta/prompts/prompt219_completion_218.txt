Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length === other.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if the two deltas have the same number of operations, rather than checking if they are identical in content.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops !== other.ops
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the two arrays of operations are not the same reference, which would always return true if they are different instances, regardless of their content.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.some((op, index) => op !== other.ops[index])
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if any operation in `this.ops` is not equal to the corresponding operation in `other.ops`, which could lead to false negatives if the arrays are of different lengths or if the operations are not in the same order.

DONE.
