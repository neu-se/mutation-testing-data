  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unknown"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildCountry` function would receive a different argument, which could lead to the creation of a different country object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildCountry` function would receive a null argument, which could lead to the creation of a null country object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildCountry` function would receive an undefined argument, which could lead to the creation of an undefined country object.

DONE.
