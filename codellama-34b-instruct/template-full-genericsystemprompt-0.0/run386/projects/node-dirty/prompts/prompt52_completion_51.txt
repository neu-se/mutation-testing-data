Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `update` method to always update the value stored at the given key with the result of the `updater` function, but only if the key exists. If the key does not exist, the `update` method would do nothing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key) || this._data.set(key, {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `update` method to always update the value stored at the given key with the result of the `updater` function, but only
