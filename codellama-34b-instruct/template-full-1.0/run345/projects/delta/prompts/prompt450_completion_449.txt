  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof op.retain` would always return `'string'`, even if `op.retain` is a number or an object. This would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, and the `else` statement to always execute, even if `op.retain` is a number or an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.retain` is always truthy, so the `if` statement would always evaluate to `true`, even if `op.retain` is not a number or an object. This would cause the `else` statement to never execute, even if `op.retain` is a number or an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain !== 'number' && typeof op.retain !== 'object'
