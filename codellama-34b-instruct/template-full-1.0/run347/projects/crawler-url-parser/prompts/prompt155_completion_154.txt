  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```await (pageurl_without_last_part + `#${linkurl_parts.pop()}`);return "uplevel"```
This would result in different behavior because it would
cause the linkurl_parts.pop() method to be executed before the code returns,
resulting in a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```pageurl_without_last_part + `/${linkurl_parts.pop()}`;return "uplevel"```
This would result in different behavior because it would
cause the linkurl_parts.pop() method to be executed before the code returns,
resulting in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```return pageurl_without_last_part + `/${linkurl_parts.pop()}`;```
This would result in different behavior because it would
cause the code to return a string with a different value than the original code.
DONE.
