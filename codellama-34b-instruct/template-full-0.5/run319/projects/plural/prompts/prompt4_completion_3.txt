  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-8, -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative sign would cause the slice method to return a different substring.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
8, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice method would return the same substring as the original code, but the regex would match a different set of words.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
8, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice method would return the same substring as the original code, but the regex would match a different set of words.

DONE.
