  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `cb` function with a single argument, while this replacement calls it with two arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(new Error('error'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not handle errors, while this replacement calls the `cb` function with an error argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, 'hello')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not return any data, while this replacement calls the `cb` function with a string argument.

DONE.
