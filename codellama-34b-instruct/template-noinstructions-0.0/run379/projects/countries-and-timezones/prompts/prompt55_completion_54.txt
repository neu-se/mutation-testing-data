  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options` is an object with properties, while `{}` is an empty object with no properties. This could cause the `deliverTimezones` function to return a different result, potentially leading to a bug.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options` is an object with properties, while `null` is a null value. This could cause the `deliverTimezones` function to return a different result, potentially leading to a bug.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options` is an object with properties, while `undefined` is a value that indicates the absence of a value. This could cause the `deliverTimezones` function to return a different result, potentially leading to a bug.

DONE.
