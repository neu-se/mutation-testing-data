  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `allRejected` would return a rejected promise if any of the input promises are rejected, whereas `allResolved` returns a promise that is fulfilled with an array of all the input promises, regardless of whether they are fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
anyResolved

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstResolved
```
This would result in different behavior because `firstResolved` would return a promise that is fulfilled with the value of the first resolved promise, whereas `allResolved` returns a promise that is fulfilled with an array of all the input promises, regardless
