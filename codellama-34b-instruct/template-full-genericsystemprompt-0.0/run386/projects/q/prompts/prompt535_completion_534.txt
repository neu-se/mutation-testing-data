  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, which could cause the code to behave differently if the promise is rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the rejected argument is not passed, which could cause the code to behave differently if the promise is rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the fulfilled argument is not passed, which could cause the code to behave differently if the promise is fulfilled.

DONE.
