  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._writeStream` is a different object than `this._readStream`, and it may not have the same properties or methods as `this._readStream`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data` is a `Map` object, and it may not have the same properties or methods as `this._readStream`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` is a reference to the current object, and it may not have the same properties or methods as `this._readStream`.

DONE.
