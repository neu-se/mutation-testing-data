  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof otherOp.delete === 'number' &&
          (typeof thisOp.retain === 'number' ||
            (typeof thisOp.retain === 'object' && thisOp.retain !== null))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator would return `'object'` for `null` and `undefined`, while the original code fragment would only match if `thisOp.retain` is a non-null object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof otherOp.delete === 'number' &&
          (typeof thisOp.retain === 'number' ||
            (typeof thisOp.retain === 'object' && thisOp.retain !== null))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator would match if `thisOp.retain` is `null` or `undefined`, while the original code fragment would only match if `thisOp.retain` is a non-null object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER
