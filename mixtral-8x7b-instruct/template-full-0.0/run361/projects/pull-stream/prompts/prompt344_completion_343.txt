 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort(abort === true ? null: abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` function is now being called with an argument, whereas in the original code, it was being called without any arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` function is now being called with a hard-coded value of `true`, whereas in the original code, it was being called without any arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
global.onAbort && onAbort(abort === true ? null: abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` function is now being called only if the `global` object has an `onAbort` property, whereas in the original code, it was being called unconditionally.

DONE.
