  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `fapply` method on the `this` object, which is not the same as calling the `fapply` method on the `Q` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fapply
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `fapply` method on the `Q` object, which is not the same as calling the `fapply` method on the `this` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.nfapply
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `nfapply` method on the `this` object, which is not the same as calling the `fapply` method on the `Q` object.

DONE.
