  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using `this` to refer to the current object, but replacing it with 0 would cause the method to return a different object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using `this` to refer to the current object, but replacing it with null would cause the method to return null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using `this` to refer to the current object, but replacing it with an empty object would cause the method to return a different object.

DONE.
