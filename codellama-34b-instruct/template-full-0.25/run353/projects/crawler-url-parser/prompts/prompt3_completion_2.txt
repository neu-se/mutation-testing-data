  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` returns a string indicating the type of the operand, while `===` checks for strict equality. In this case, `currentUrlStr` is undefined, so `typeof currentUrlStr === 'undefined'` would return true, but `currentUrlStr === undefined` would return false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr == null
```
This would result in different behavior because `==` checks for equality after converting the operands to a common type, while `===` checks for strict equality. In this case, `currentUrlStr` is undefined, so `currentUrlStr == null` would return true, but `currentUrlStr === null` would return false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, while `undefined` is a primitive value that represents the absence of any value.
