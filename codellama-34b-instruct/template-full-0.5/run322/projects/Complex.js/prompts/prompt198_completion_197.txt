  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b, z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the imaginary part of the complex number instead of the real part, which would change the result of the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b, z['re'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the real part of the complex number, which would change the result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b, z['re'] - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the real part of the complex number, which would change the result of the calculation.

DONE.
