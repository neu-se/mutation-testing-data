  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the captured group would be different, potentially causing the `Number()` function to receive a different argument and returning a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1[1] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the captured group would be different, potentially causing the `Number()` function to receive a different argument and returning a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1[2] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the captured group would be different, potentially causing the `Number()` function to receive a different argument and returning a different value.

DONE.
