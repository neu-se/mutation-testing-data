Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `stream` is exactly `null`, which would not account for other non-function types, leading to incorrect handling of valid streams that are not functions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof stream === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly allow any object (including non-stream objects) to be treated as a valid stream, potentially causing runtime errors when the code expects a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream instanceof Array
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `stream` is an instance of an Array, which would incorrectly allow only arrays to be processed as streams, ignoring other valid stream types that are not arrays.

DONE.
