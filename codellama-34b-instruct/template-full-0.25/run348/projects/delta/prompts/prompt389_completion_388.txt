  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekLength()` is a function call that returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, while `otherIter.peekLength` is a property that returns the length of the current operation in the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekLength() + 1` would return the length of the next operation in the iterator plus one, while `otherIter.peekLength` would return the length of the current operation in the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekLength() - 1` would return the length of the next operation in the iterator minus one, while `otherIter.peekLength` would return the length
