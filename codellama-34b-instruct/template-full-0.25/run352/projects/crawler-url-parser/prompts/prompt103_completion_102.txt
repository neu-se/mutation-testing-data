  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.includes(text)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is removed, causing the condition to be true when the `text` is found in `tmpUrl.text`, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.indexOf(text) > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` returns the index of the first occurrence of the `text` in `tmpUrl.text`, and the condition is true when the `text` is found at any position in `tmpUrl.text`, not just at the beginning.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.match(text)
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` returns an array of matches, and the condition is true when there is at least one match in `tmpUrl.text`, not just when the `text` is found at the beginning.
