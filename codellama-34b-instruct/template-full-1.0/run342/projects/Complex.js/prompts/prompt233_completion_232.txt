  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 / (r - a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the denominator of the expression to a value that is always positive, whereas the original code fragment includes a term that can be negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(r + a) / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the denominator of the expression to a value that is always positive, whereas the original code fragment includes a term that can be negative. Additionally, it changes the numerator to include an additional term that could potentially affect the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(r - a) / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the denominator of the expression to a value that is always positive, whereas the original code fragment includes a term that can be negative. Additionally, it changes the numerator to a value that is always smaller than the original expression, which could potentially affect the result.

DONE.
