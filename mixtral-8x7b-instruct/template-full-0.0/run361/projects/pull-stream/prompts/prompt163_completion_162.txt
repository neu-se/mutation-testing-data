 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the array has a length of 0, instead of checking if the array exists. This could pass the test if the array is null or undefined, but the original code would have thrown an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof array === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it specifically checks if the array is undefined, whereas the original code checks if the array is not an array. This could pass the test if the array is null, but the original code would have thrown an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(array) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the array is not an array, whereas the original code checks if the array is not an array. This could pass the test if the array is null or a non-array object, but the original code would have thrown an error or
