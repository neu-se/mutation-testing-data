  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.slice.call(this, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `slice` method on the `this` object, which is not the same as calling it on the `Array.prototype` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.slice.call(this, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `slice` method on the `this` object, starting from the second element instead of the first.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.slice.call(this, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `slice` method on the `this` object, starting from the last element instead of the first.

DONE.
