  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key).toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the uppercase version of the value stored at the given key, rather than the value itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key).length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the value stored at the given key, rather than the value itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key).split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value stored at the given key with the characters reversed, rather than the value itself.

DONE.
