  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(promises);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` function would resolve the promise with the original array of promises, rather than the array of settled values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(promises);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` function would reject the promise with the original array of promises, rather than the array of settled values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(promises);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` function would notify the promise with the original array of promises, rather than the array of settled values.

DONE.
