  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!seen[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the key is present in the `seen` object, while this modified code checks if the key is not present. This would cause the filter function to return a different result for items that have already been seen.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
seen[key] === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the key is present in the `seen` object, while this modified code checks if the value associated with the key is `true`. This would cause the filter function to return a different result for items that have already been seen.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
seen[key] = true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the key is present in the `seen` object, while this modified code sets the value associated with the key to `true`. This would cause the filter function to return a different result for items that have
