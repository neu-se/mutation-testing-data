  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.enter
```
This would result in different behavior because `domain.enter` is a different function than `domain.exit`, and would cause the code to enter the domain instead of exiting it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.exit()
```
This would result in different behavior because `domain.exit()` is a function call, whereas `domain.exit` is a reference to the function itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.exit(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `domain.exit(1)` is a function call with an argument, whereas `domain.exit` is a reference to the function itself.

DONE.
