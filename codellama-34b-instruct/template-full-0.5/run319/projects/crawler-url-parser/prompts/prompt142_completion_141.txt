  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is empty, which would cause the regular expression to match the entire string instead of just the "default" portion.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '/default'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string includes the "default" portion, which would cause the regular expression to match the entire string instead of just the "default" portion.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '/default.'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string includes the "default" portion and a period at the end, which would cause the regular expression to match the entire string instead of just the "default" portion.

DONE.
