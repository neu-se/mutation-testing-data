Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true, data
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the first argument of the callback from `null` to `true`, which may lead the calling function to interpret the result as an error or a successful termination, altering the expected flow of execution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the second argument `data` with `null`, which means that the caller would receive no data when it expects valid data, potentially causing confusion or errors in downstream processing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, data
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `end` variable instead of `null`, which could mislead the caller into thinking that the read operation has ended when it has not, affecting the logic that relies on the end state of the read operation.

DONE.
