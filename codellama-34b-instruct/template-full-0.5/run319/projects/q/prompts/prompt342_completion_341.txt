  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deferred.resolve(_fulfilled(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the deferred promise with the result of `_fulfilled(value)`, which is a function call, instead of resolving it with the original `value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deferred.resolve(value + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the deferred promise with the result of `value + 1`, which is a different value than the original `value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deferred.reject(new Error("Invalid value"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the deferred promise with a new error, instead of resolving it with the original `value`.

DONE.
