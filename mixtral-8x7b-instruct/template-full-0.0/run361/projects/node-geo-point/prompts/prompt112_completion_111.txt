 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `Math.tan` function is replaced with its reciprocal, which can lead to different results in the `toTile` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.tan` function is replaced with the exponential function, which can lead to significantly different results in the `toTile` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.asin
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.tan` function is replaced with the arcsine function, which can lead to incorrect results in the `toTile` method.

By introducing these changes, the mutation testing process highlights potential weaknesses in the test suite, as the tests should fail due to the altered behavior. This provides a starting point for developers to improve their test suite and ensure better code coverage.
