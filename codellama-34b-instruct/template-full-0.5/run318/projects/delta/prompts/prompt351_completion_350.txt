  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an object and does not have an `attributes` property, which would cause the `AttributeMap.invert` method to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty object `{}` does not have an `attributes` property, which would cause the `AttributeMap.invert` method to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{attributes: null}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attributes` property is set to `null`, which would cause the `AttributeMap.invert` method to fail.

DONE.
