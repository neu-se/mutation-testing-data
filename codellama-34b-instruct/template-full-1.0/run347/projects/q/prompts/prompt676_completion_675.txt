  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[null, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the second argument passed to the `dispatch` method from `args` to `null`. The `dispatch` method would still receive two arguments, but the second one would be `null` instead of the expected `args` array. This could cause the `dispatch` method to behave unexpectedly and possibly lead to errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, args, 0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an extra `0` argument to the `dispatch` method call. The `dispatch` method would still receive three arguments, but the third one would always be `0` instead of the expected `undefined` value. This could cause the `dispatch` method to behave unexpectedly and possibly lead to errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[args[0], args.slice(1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the first
