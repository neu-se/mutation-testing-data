  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `value` is not null, while the new code fragment checks if `value` is null. This change would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `value` is null, which would result in the `abortCb` function being called with a null value, which is likely not the intended behavior.

DONE.
