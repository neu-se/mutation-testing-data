  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op, index) => !predicate(op, index)
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function is negated, which would cause the filter function to return the opposite of what it should.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op, index) => predicate(op, index) && index % 2 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function is modified to only return true for even-indexed elements, which would cause the filter function to return a different subset of the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op, index) => predicate(op, index) || index === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function is modified to return true for the first element of the array, which would cause the filter function to return a different subset of the original array.

DONE.
