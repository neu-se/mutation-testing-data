  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the result would be flipped, causing the `tanh` function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh(a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function would be applied to a different value, causing the `tanh` function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh(a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinh` function would be applied to a different value, causing the `tanh` function to return a different value.

DONE.
