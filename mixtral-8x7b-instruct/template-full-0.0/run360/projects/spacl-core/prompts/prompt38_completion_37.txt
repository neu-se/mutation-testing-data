 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''.concat(spec,'/').slice
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an extra slash at the beginning of the regex, causing it to fail to match paths that don't start with a slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('').slice
```
This would result in different behavior because it splits the spec string into individual characters instead of path segments, causing it to fail to match any path correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').sort.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because it sorts the path segments before slicing, causing it to fail to match paths with a specific order of segments.

DONE.
