  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.val
```
This would result in the program returning the value of the exception, which is not what was intended in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.message
```
This would result in the program returning the message associated with the exception, rather than the exception itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in the program returning a value that is not an exception, which would cause the program to behave differently.

DONE.
