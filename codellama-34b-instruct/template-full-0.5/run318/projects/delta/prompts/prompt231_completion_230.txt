  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` variable is not used in the original code fragment, and the `otherIter.peekLength()` method is called twice, which could result in different values being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` variable is not used in the original code fragment, and the `otherIter.peekLength()` method is called twice, which could result in different values being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() * length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` variable is not used in the original code fragment, and the `otherIter.peekLength()` method is called twice, which could result in different values being returned.

DONE.
