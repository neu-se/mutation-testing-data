  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.message
```
This would result in different behavior because `err.message` is a string, while `err` is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code
```
This would result in different behavior because `err.code` is a string, while `err` is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because `new Error(err)` creates a new error object with the original error object as its message, while `err` is an object.

DONE.
