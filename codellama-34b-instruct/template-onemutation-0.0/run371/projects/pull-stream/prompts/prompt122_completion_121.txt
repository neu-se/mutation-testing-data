  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `source` passes the `data` argument to the `sink` function, while the new code fragment `sink(null)` passes `null` instead. This could cause the `sink` function to behave differently, potentially leading to errors or unexpected results.

DONE.
