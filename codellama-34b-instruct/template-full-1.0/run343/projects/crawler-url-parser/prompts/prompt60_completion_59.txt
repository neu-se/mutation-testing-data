  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of URL.parse() determines whether to parse the query string. By setting this value to false, the query string will not be parsed, which could cause different behavior in the application.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument of URL.parse() determines whether to parse the hash fragment. By setting this value to false, the hash fragment will not be parsed, which could cause different behavior in the application.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, true, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the fourth argument of URL.parse() determines whether to parse the query string and hash fragment concurrently. By setting this value to true, the query string and hash fragment will be parsed concurrently,
