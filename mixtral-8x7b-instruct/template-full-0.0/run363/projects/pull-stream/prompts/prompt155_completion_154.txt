 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` function would be called instead of `cb` when an abort signal is received, which might not be expected by the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of arguments passed to `cb` is reversed, which might not be expected by the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `value` variable is not set to `null` after being used, which might cause unintended side effects in future calls to the function, and might not be expected by the test suite.

DONE.
