  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the value of the `b` object instead of the `a` object, which could lead to unexpected results if the two objects have different values for the same key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the key itself instead of the value associated with the key in the `b` object. This could lead to false positives or false negatives in the `isEqual` comparison.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the value `undefined` instead of the value associated with the key in the `a` object. This could lead to false positives or false negatives in the `isEqual` comparison.

DONE.
