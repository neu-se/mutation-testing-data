Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp` calculates the exponential of a number, which is fundamentally different from taking the logarithm, leading to incorrect results in the context of the `logHypot` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log1p
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log1p` computes the natural logarithm of `1 + x`, which changes the mathematical operation being performed and can lead to incorrect results when calculating the logarithm of the sum of squares.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` computes the square root of a number, which alters the intended calculation of the logarithm of the sum of squares, resulting in a completely different output.

DONE.
