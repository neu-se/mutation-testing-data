  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `b` variable, which is the imaginary part of the complex number, while the replaced code fragment is using the `a` variable, which is the real part of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b*a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `b` variable, which is the imaginary part of the complex number, while the replaced code fragment is using the `b*a` expression, which is the product of the imaginary and real parts of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a*a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `b` variable, which is the imaginary part of the complex number, while the replaced code fragment is using the `a*a` expression, which is the square of the real part of the complex number.
