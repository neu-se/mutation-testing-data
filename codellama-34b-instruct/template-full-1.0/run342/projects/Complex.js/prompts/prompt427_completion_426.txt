  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
11
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be multiplying the exponent by 11 instead of 10, which would alter the result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
12
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be multiplying the exponent by 12 instead of 10, which would alter the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
9
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be multiplying the exponent by 9 instead of 10, which would alter the result.

DONE.
