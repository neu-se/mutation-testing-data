  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
EOL + ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because `EOL` is a string containing the end-of-line character, but `EOL + ' '` is a string containing the end-of-line character followed by a space. This would cause the `replace()` method to behave differently, potentially leading to test failures.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
EOL.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `EOL` is a string containing the end-of-line character, but `EOL.toUpperCase()` is a string containing the end-of-line character in uppercase. This would cause the `replace()` method to behave differently, potentially leading to test failures.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\r'
```
This would result in different behavior because `'\r'` is a string containing a different end-of-line character than `'\n'` (the one used in the original
