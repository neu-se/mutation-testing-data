  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isNaN` checks if a value is `NaN`, whereas `Number.isFinite` checks if a value is a finite number. Using `Number.isNaN` would cause the function to return `Complex['INFINITY']` when the input is `NaN`, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isInteger
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isInteger` checks if a value is an integer, whereas `Number.isFinite` checks if a value is a finite number. Using `Number.isInteger` would cause the function to return `Complex['INFINITY']` when the input is an integer, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isSafeInteger
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isSafeInteger` checks if a
