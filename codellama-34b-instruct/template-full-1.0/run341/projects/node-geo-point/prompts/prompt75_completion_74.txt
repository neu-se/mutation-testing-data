  *Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number(bearing) + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is added to the value of `bearing`, which would cause the calculation of `rad2deg(θ)` to be incorrect.

*Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Number(bearing)
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of `bearing` is inverted, which would cause the calculation of `rad2deg(θ)` to be incorrect.

*Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number(bearing + 180)
```
This would result in different behavior because `180` is added to the value of `bearing`, which would cause the calculation of `rad2deg(θ)` to be incorrect.

DONE.
