  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [id]: getTimezone(id) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function is replaced with `getTimezone`, which would return a different value for the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [id]: getCountry(id + 1, options) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `id` parameter passed to `getCountry` is incremented by 1, which would result in a different country being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [id]: getCountry(id, { deprecated: true }) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options` parameter passed to `getCountry` includes the `deprecated` key with a value of `true`, which would result in a different value being returned for the same input.

DONE.
