  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...rules.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` creates a shallow copy of the array, while the original code fragment creates a reference to the same array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...rules.concat([])
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat()` creates a new array by concatenating the original array with an empty array, while the original code fragment creates a reference to the same array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...rules.map((rule) => rule)
```
This would result in different behavior because `map()` creates a new array by applying a function to each element of the original array, while the original code fragment creates a reference to the same array.

DONE.
