  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would add 1 to the value of `field`, which would change the key used in the `seen` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operator would subtract 1 from the value of `field`, which would change the key used in the `seen` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator would multiply the value of `field` by 2, which would change the key used in the `seen` object.

DONE.
