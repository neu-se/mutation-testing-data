  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek()` returns the next op without advancing the iterator, while `next()` advances the iterator and returns the current op. In this case, using `peek()` would cause the iterator to get stuck in an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `next(1)` advances the iterator by one op, while `next()` advances the iterator to the next op that satisfies the given condition. In this case, using `next(1)` would cause the iterator to skip over some ops that would not be skipped over using `next()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next
```
This would result in different behavior because `next` is a property that refers to the next op in the iterator, while `next()` is a method that advances the iterator to the next op.
