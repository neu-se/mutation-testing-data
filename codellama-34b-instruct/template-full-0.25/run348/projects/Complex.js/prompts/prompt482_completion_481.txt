  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` is a different function than `isFinite`, and it checks for a different condition (whether a value is NaN, or "Not a Number").

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for a different condition (whether the imaginary part of the complex number is equal to infinity, rather than whether the number is finite).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for a different condition (whether the real part of the complex number is equal to infinity, rather than whether the number is finite).

DONE.
