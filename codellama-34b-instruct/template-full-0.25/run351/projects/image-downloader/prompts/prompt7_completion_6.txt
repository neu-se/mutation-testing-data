  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!extractFilename
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `extractFilename`, which means that the code inside the `if` statement would be executed even if `extractFilename` is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
extractFilename === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, which means that the code inside the `if` statement would be executed only if `extractFilename` is `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
extractFilename !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, which means that the code inside the `if` statement would be executed only if `extractFilename` is not `true`.

DONE.
