  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezonesMap(data.timezones)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getTimezonesMap` function with the `data.timezones` object as an argument, which is not the same as calling it with the `data` object as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezonesMap(data.timezones)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `buildTimezonesMap` function with the `data.timezones` object as an argument, which is not the same as calling it with the `data` object as in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(data.timezones).reduce((result, id) => {
  const tz = data.timezones[id];
  const { c, a } = tz;
  const aliasTz = data.timez
