  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a && onEnd
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a || !onEnd` checks if `a` is truthy or `onEnd` is falsy, while the new code fragment `a && onEnd` checks if `a` is truthy and `onEnd` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!a || onEnd
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a || !onEnd` checks if `a` is truthy or `onEnd` is falsy, while the new code fragment `!a || onEnd` checks if `a` is falsy or `onEnd` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== onEnd
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a || !onEnd` checks if `a` is truthy or `onEnd` is falsy, while the new
