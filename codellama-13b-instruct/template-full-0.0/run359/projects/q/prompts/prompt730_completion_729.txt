  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify({ index: index, value: progress });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deferred.notify` function to be called with an object containing the `index` and `value` properties, rather than just the `value` property. This could potentially cause the `deferred.notify` function to be called with different arguments than the original code, which could affect the behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(progress);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deferred.notify` function to be called with just the `progress` argument, rather than an object containing the `index` and `value` properties. This could potentially cause the `deferred.notify` function to be called with different arguments than the original code, which could affect the behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(index, progress);
```
