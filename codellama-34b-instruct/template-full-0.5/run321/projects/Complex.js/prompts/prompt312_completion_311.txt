  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the value of `b` to `a`, which is not the intended behavior of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the value of `b` from `a`, which is not the intended behavior of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the value of `a` by `b`, which is not the intended behavior of the function.

DONE.
