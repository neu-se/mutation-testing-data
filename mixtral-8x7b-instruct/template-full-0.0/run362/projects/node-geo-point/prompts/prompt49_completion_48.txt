 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Math.abs(point2.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the absolute value of the longitude instead of the latitude for point2, which could lead to incorrect calculations in the `calculateBearing` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use 0 as the latitude for point2, which could lead to incorrect calculations in the `calculateBearing` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a random number as the latitude for point2, which could lead to unpredictable results in the `calculateBearing` method.

DONE.
