  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[null, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, which is not the same as `void 0`, which is a special value that represents an "undefined" or "unassigned" value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[arguments, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments` is a special value that represents the current function's arguments object, while `args` is a separate variable that holds the arguments passed to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, []]
```
This would result in different behavior because `[]` is an empty array, which is not the same as `args`, which is an array with the `args` passed to the function.

DONE.
