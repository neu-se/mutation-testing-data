 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'.'
```
This would result in different behavior because it resolves the destination path relative to the current file instead of the module's directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.cwd()
```
This would result in different behavior because it resolves the destination path relative to the current working directory, which might not be the same as the module's directory.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the destination path to the URL's pathname, which might not be a valid file path.

By introducing these changes, the test suite should fail, indicating that the tests are checking for the correct behavior and can be used as a starting point for improving the test suite.

DONE.
