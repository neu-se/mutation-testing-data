  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!path.isAbsolute(options.dest.path)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `dest` property of the `options` object is an absolute path, rather than the `dest` property itself. This could cause the function to incorrectly reject a valid path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!!path.isAbsolute(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` regardless of the value of `options.dest`. This could cause the function to always resolve with a valid path, even if it shouldn't.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!path.isAbsolute(options.dest.slice(1))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `dest` property of the `options` object is an absolute path, but starting from the second character. This could cause the function to incorrectly reject a valid path that starts with a `/`.
