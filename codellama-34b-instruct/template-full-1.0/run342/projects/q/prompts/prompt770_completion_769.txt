  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises[0]

This would result in different behavior because `promises[0]` is always the first promise in the array, regardless of its status, while `this` refers to the current promise in the context of the `allResolved` method. This could cause the `allResolved` method to return a promise that is not settled, even if all the other promises have been resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

```
This would result in different behavior because `promises[promises.length - 1]` always refers to the last promise in the array, while `this` refers to the current promise in the context of the `allResolved` method. This could cause the `allResolved` method to return a promise that is settled, even if all the other promises have not been resolved or rejected.
