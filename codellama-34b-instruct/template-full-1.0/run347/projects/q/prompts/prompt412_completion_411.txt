  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state !== "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the condition, causing the code to enter the "rejected" branch instead of the "fulfilled" branch when the promise is fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state !== "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the condition, causing the code to enter the "fulfilled" branch instead of the "rejected" branch when the promise is rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!inspected.state
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the state is falsy, which would be true for both "fulfilled" and "rejected" states.

DONE.
