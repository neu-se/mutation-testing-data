  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(onFulfilled, onRejected, onProgress)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `onProgress` callback to be called for each promise in the array, regardless of whether it was fulfilled or rejected. In the original code, the `onProgress` callback is only called for promises that are still pending.

DONE.
