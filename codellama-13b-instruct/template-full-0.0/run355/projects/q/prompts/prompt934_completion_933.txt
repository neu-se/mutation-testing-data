  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, args
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `void 0` when `args` is an empty array, while the buggy code fragment returns `args` when `args` is an empty array. This could cause issues if the function is called with an empty array as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `args` when `args` is an empty array, while the buggy code fragment returns `void 0` when `args` is an empty array. This could cause issues if the function is called with an empty array as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.length ? args : void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `args` when `args` is an empty array, while the buggy code fragment returns `void 0` when `args` is an empty
