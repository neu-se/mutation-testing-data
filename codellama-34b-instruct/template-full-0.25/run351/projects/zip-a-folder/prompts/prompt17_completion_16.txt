  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the `targetBasePath` string to uppercase, which could cause the `access()` method to fail if the path is case-sensitive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property would return the length of the `targetBasePath` string, which could cause the `access()` method to fail if the path is not the correct length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring()` method would return a substring of the `targetBasePath` string starting from the second character, which could cause the `access()` method to fail if the path is not the correct length or if it contains invalid characters.

DONE.
