  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const thisOp = iter.peek(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek` method returns the next operation in the iterator, but the `<PLACEHOLDER>` is not a valid operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const thisOp = iter.peek(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek` method returns the next operation in the iterator, but the `<PLACEHOLDER>` is not a valid operation.

DONE.
