  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.parse()` method would throw an error, as it expects a string as its first argument, but `null` is not a valid string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.parse()` method would throw an error, as it expects a string as its first argument, but `undefined` is not a valid string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.parse()` method would throw an error, as it expects a string as its first argument, but `''` is an empty string, which is not a valid JSON string.

DONE.
