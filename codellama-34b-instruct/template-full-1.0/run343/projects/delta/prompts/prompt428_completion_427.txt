  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the condition, making it check for retain not being an object instead of being one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for retain being a number instead of an object, and also invert the condition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for retain not being a number instead of an object, and also invert the condition.

DONE.
