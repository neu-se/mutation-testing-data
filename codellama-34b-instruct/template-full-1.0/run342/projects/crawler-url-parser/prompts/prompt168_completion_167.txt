  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.indexOf(linkurl_path) === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` checks if the first argument is a substring of the second argument, whereas `includes` checks if the first argument is a substring of the second argument or if the first argument is equal to the second argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.slice(-pageurl_path.length) === pageurl_path
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` returns a new string object without modifying the original, whereas `replace` modifies the original string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path !== linkurl_path
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the two strings are different, whereas the original code checks if the first string is a substring of the second string.

DONE.
