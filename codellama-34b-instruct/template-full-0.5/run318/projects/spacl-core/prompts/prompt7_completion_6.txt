  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\/\//) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the path contains consecutive slashes, while this new code fragment checks if the path does not contain consecutive slashes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\/\//) === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match` method returns `null` if no matches are found, while `undefined` is returned if the method is called on a non-string object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\/\//) !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match` method returns `null` if no matches are found, while `undefined` is returned if the method is called on a non-string object. However, this new code fragment checks if the result is not `undefined`, which would be true if the path contains consecutive slashes.

DONE.
