Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prevent the current stream from aborting, causing the function to always attempt to read the next chunk or stream, potentially leading to an infinite loop if the stream never ends.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because using `null` would not trigger the abort logic, leading to the function continuing to process data even when it should stop, which could result in unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always abort the current stream, regardless of the actual state of the stream, which could lead to premature termination of the data processing.

DONE.
