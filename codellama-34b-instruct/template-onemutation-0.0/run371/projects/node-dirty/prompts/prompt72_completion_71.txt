  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error('Failed to load database')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an error event with a custom error message instead of the original `'load', 0` event, which would cause the `Dirty` constructor to emit an error event instead of a load event.

DONE.
