  Sure, I can help you with that!

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_has_illegal_chars(str) { return /[a-z0-9\:\/\?\#\[\]\@\!\$\&\'\(\)\*\+\,\;\=\.\-\_\~\%]/.test(str);
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is now matching any alphanumeric character instead of the original pattern which was intended to match any character that is not allowed in a URL. This means that the function will now return `true` for any string that contains illegal characters, which is the opposite behavior of the original function.
