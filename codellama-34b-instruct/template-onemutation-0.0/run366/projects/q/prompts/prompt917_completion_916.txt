  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of an array. In this case, the `nodeArgs` array is used to pass arguments to a Node.js function, and the order of the arguments may be important. By using `unshift` instead of `push`, the arguments may be passed in the wrong order, causing the function to behave differently.
