  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_map` function would be applied to the reversed array instead of the original array, which could potentially cause the `allResolved` function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_map` function would be applied to a slice of the original array, which could potentially cause the `allResolved` function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.concat(promises)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_map` function would be applied to a concatenated array of the original array, which could potentially cause the `allResolved` function to return a different value.

DONE.
