  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string literal, while the new code fragment is a variable name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string literal, while the new code fragment is a string concatenation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose'.plural()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string literal, while the new code fragment is a function call.

DONE.
