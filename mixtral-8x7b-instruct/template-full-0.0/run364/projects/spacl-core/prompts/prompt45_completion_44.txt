 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
part.search(/:.+/) > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` returns the index of the match, not the match itself, and it can't distinguish between a successful match and no match.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
/:.+/.test(part)
```
This would result in different behavior because `test` checks if the regex matches the string and returns a boolean, but it doesn't extract the matched group.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
part.includes(':')
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` checks if the string contains the specified substring, but it doesn't ensure that the colon is the first character in the group.

DONE.
