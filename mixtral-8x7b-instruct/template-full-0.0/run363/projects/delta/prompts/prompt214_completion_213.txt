 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
other.ops.slice(1)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it skips the first operation in the `other` Delta, instead of using the first operation as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
other.ops[Math.floor(Math.random() * other.ops.length)]
