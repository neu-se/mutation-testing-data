  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be using the imaginary part of the complex number instead of the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] + z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be adding the real and imaginary parts of the complex number instead of just using the real part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] * z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be multiplying the real and imaginary parts of the complex number instead of just using the real part.

DONE.
