  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `nextOp.retain` is a number, while the new code fragment checks if it is a string. This change would cause the `retain` property to be treated as a string, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the `next` method.

DONE.
