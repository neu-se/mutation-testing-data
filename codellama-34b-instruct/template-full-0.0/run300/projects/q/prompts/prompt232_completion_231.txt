  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
operands[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because `operands[2]` is a different value than `operands[1]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
operands[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `operands[0]` is a different value than `operands[1]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
operands.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `operands.length` is a different value than `operands[1]`.

DONE.
