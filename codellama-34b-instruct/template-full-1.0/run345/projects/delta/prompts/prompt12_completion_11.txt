  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
!a[key] && b[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!a[key]` check would always return `false` if `a[key]` is `undefined`, and the resulting expression would always be `false`, even if `b[key]` is `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
a[key] === undefined && b[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a[key] === undefined` check would always return `true` if `a[key]` is `undefined`, and the resulting expression would always be `true`, even if `b[key]` is not `undefined`.
