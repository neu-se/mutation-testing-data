  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]y$|quy$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regular expression is removed, causing the regular expression to be case-sensitive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]y$|quy$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regular expression causes the regular expression to match all occurrences in the input string, rather than just the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]y$|quy$/m
```
This would result in different behavior because the `m` flag at the end of the regular expression causes the regular expression to match across multiple lines in the input string.

DONE.
