  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and it would match a different set of URLs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and it would match a different set of URLs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and it would match a different set of URLs.

DONE.
