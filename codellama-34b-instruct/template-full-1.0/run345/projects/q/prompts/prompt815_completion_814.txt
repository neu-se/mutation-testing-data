  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    throw reason;
```
This would result in different behavior because the error thrown would not be the same as the original error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    throw new Error("new error");
```
This would result in different behavior because a new error object would be thrown with a different message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    reject(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because the error would be rejected instead of thrown, which would cause a different execution path in the code.

DONE.
