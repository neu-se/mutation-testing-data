  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListeners.push(<promise>.notify(operands[1]));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the return value of the `notify` method, which is another promise, instead of the original function reference.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListeners.push(() => operands[0](operands[1]));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new function that returns the result of calling `operands[0]` with `operands[1]` as an argument, which could be different from the original `operands[1]` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListeners.push(operands[0].apply(this, operands[1]));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `apply` method on the `operands[0]` function, which could potentially have different behavior than the original code.
