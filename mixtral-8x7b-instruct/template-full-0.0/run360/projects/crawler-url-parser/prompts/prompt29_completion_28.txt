 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'http://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it always prepends 'http://' to the currentUrlStr, even if it already has a protocol specified.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
parsedUrl.protocol || 'http://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it only prepends 'http://' if the currentUrlStr doesn't have a protocol specified.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
baseUrlStr.protocol || 'http://'
