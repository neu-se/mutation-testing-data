  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i++], array[i++]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would return the same element twice in a row, rather than advancing to the next element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always return null, regardless of the length of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always return the length of the array, rather than getting the next element.

DONE.
