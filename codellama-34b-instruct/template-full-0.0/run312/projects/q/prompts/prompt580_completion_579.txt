  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(null, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method would return a new function with a different `this` value, which could cause the `continuer` function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(undefined, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method would return a new function with a different `this` value, which could cause the `continuer` function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(void 0, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method would return a new function with a different `this` value, which could cause the `continuer` function to behave differently.

DONE.
