  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection, reason
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reason` parameter is not being passed to the `untrackRejection` function, which could cause the function to not properly remove the rejection from the `unhandledRejections` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reason` parameter is not being passed to the `untrackRejection` function, which could cause the function to not properly remove the rejection from the `unhandledRejections` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejection` parameter is not being passed to the `untrackRejection` function, which could cause the function to not properly remove the rejection from the `unhandledRejections` array.

DONE.
