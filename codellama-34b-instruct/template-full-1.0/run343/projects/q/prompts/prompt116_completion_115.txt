  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `index` is used to access an element of the `this` object, but `this` refers to the global object in the evaluation of a top-level script, so the replaced code would access a different element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"index"
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `index` is used as a property name of the `this` object, but in the replaced code, "index" is a string literal, so the snippet would access a different property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
window
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `index` is used as a property name of the `this` object, but in the replaced code, `window` is used as an object, so the snippet would access a different property.

DONE.
