  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` method would not be called with the expected `error` argument, leading to an unhandled rejection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` method would be called with an empty object instead of an `Error` object, which could cause issues when trying to handle the rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` method would be called with a string instead of an `Error` object, which could cause issues when trying to handle the rejection.

DONE.
