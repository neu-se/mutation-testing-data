 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise` is the built-in constructor for promises, while `Q` is an external library. Using `Promise` instead of `Q` would bypass the custom promise implementation and its associated tests.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is used to create a rejected promise, while the original code uses a placeholder. Replacing it with `Q.reject` would create a rejected promise immediately, which might not be handled correctly by the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.resolve(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve(reason)` creates a fulfilled promise with the `reason` as its value, while the original code throws an exception. This change would bypass the exception handling and create a different execution path, which might not be covered by the
