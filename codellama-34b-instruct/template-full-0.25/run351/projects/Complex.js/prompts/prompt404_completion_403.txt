  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because `x['re']` is the real part of the complex number, while `x['im']` is the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x['im'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `x['im'] + 1` would add 1 to the imaginary part of the complex number, while `x['im']` would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x['re'] * x['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because `x['re'] * x['im']` would multiply the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, while `x['im']` would not.

DONE.
