  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"embedType"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the string "embedType", regardless of the actual type of the embed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"embedType" + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the string "embedType1", regardless of the actual type of the embed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"embedType" + Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a random string that starts with "embedType", regardless of the actual type of the embed.

DONE.
