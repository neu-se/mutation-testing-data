  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'boolean'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the type of `op.retain` to be either a number or an object, while this suggestion checks for it to be a boolean.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!op.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the type of `op.retain` to be non-null and non-undefined, while this suggestion checks for the opposite condition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain && op.retain !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the type of `op.retain` to be either a number or an object, while this suggestion checks for `op.retain` to be truthy and not null.

DONE.
