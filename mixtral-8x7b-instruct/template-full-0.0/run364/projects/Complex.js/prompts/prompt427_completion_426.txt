 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'places' variable would be set to a smaller value, which could affect the precision of the 'ceil', 'floor', and 'round' methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.E
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'places' variable would be set to Euler's number, which is an irrational number, and would likely cause unexpected results in the 'ceil', 'floor', and 'round' methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'places' variable would be set to the real part of the complex number, which would likely cause unexpected results in the 'ceil', 'floor', and 'round' methods.

DONE.
