Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code simply calls `cb` without any arguments, which can lead to unexpected behavior in the callback function, whereas `cb(null)` explicitly passes `null` as the first argument, indicating no error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
cb(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not pass any value to the callback function, whereas `cb(true)` passes a boolean value indicating success or failure, which can affect the logic of the calling code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
cb('Unexpected error')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not pass any error message to the callback function, whereas `cb('Unexpected error')` passes a custom error message, which can change the way the calling code handles the error.

DONE.
