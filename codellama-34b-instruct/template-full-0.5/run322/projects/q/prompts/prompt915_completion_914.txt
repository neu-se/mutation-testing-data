  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred` is a function that creates a new deferred object, while `defer` is a variable that references the deferred object created earlier in the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred()
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred()` is a function call that returns a new deferred object, while `defer` is a variable that references the deferred object created earlier in the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` is a function call that creates a new deferred object using the Q library, while `defer` is a variable that references the deferred object created earlier in the function.

DONE.
