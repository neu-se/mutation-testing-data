  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args.slice(1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.slice(1)` would return a new array containing all the elements of `args` except the first one, whereas `[name, args]` returns an array containing `name` and `args` as the first two elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args.concat(args)]
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.concat(args)` would return a new array containing all the elements of `args` twice, whereas `[name, args]` returns an array containing `name` and `args` as the first two elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args.filter(function(arg) { return arg !== name; })]
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.filter(function(arg) { return arg !== name; })` would return a new array containing all the elements of `args` except
