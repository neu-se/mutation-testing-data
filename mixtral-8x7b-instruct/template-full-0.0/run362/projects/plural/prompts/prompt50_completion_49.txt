 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/[^aeiou]o\b/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for a word boundary after `o`, which is not present in the original code. This change would affect words like "photo" and "radio", which would not be matched by the new regex.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/[^aeiou]o/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it doesn't check for the end of the string (`$`), which is present in the original code. This change would cause the regex to match words like "moto" and "photo", which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/[^aeiou]o|o$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for both `[^aeiou]o` and `o$`, which is not present in the original code.
