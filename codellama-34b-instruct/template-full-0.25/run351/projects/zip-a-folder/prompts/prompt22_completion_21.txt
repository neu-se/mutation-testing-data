  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!zipAFolderOptions || !zipAFolderOptions.customWriteStream
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the condition, causing the `else` block to be executed when the `if` condition is not met, which would result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions && zipAFolderOptions.customWriteStream
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an additional condition, causing the `else` block to be executed only when both conditions are met, which would result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions && zipAFolderOptions.customWriteStream !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `customWriteStream` property is not `undefined`, which would result in an error if the property is not defined.

DONE.
