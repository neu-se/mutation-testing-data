  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.peekLength()` returns the length of the current operation, and subtracting 1 would cause the loop to skip the last operation in the iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekLength()` returns the length of the current operation in the other iterator, and subtracting 1 would cause the loop to skip the last operation in the other iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.max()` returns the larger of the two lengths, which would cause the loop to iterate over the longer of the two operations.

DONE.
