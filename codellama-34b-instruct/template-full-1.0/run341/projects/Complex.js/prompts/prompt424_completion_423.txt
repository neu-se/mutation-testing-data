  

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] && this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this['im'] && this['re']` expression would be evaluated to `0` if `this['im']` is `0`, whereas the original expression `this['isInfinite']` would be evaluated to `true` in that case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] & this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&` operator performs a bitwise AND operation, whereas the original expression `&&` performs a logical AND operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] | this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `|` operator performs a bitwise OR operation, whereas the original expression `||` performs a logical OR operation. 

DONE.
