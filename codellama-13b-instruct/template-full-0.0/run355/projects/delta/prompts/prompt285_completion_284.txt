  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `start` variable is used to determine the starting index of the line, and adding 1 to it would cause the line to start at the next index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `start` variable is used to determine the starting index of the line, and subtracting 1 from it would cause the line to start at the previous index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `start` variable is used to determine the starting index of the line, and multiplying it by 2 would cause the line to start at a different index.

DONE.
