  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, so the `then` method would be called with `null` as the fulfillment value, which would likely cause the `then` method to throw an error or return an unexpected result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, so the `then` method would be called with `undefined` as the fulfillment value, which would likely cause the `then` method to throw an error or return an unexpected result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"hello"` is a truthy value, so the `then` method would be called with `"hello"` as the fulfillment value, which would likely cause the `then` method to return a result that is not expected.

DONE.
