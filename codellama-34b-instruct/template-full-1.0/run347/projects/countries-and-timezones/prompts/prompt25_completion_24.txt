  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>(dstOffset - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `dstOffset - 1` would always be less than `dstOffset`, which means that the `dstOffsetStr` property of the returned object would always be different from the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>(primaryTimeZone.dstOffset)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `primaryTimeZone.dstOffset` property is never used in the original code, so changing the `dstOffsetStr` property to use this value would result in a different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>(timezone.u)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `timezone.u` property is used to calculate the `utcOffsetStr` property, but it is not used to calculate the `dstOffsetStr` property. So, changing the `dstOffsetStr`
