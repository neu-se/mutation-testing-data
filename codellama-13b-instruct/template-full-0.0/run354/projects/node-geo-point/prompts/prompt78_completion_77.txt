  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `deg2rad` function to convert degrees to radians, while the modified code fragment uses the `Math.PI` constant to achieve the same conversion.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `deg2rad` function to convert degrees to radians, while the modified code fragment uses the `Math.PI / 2` constant to achieve the same conversion.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `deg2rad` function to convert degrees to radians, while the modified code fragment uses the `Math.PI * 2` constant to achieve the same conversion.

DONE.
