  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.length = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reset the length of the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array to 0, which would cause the `array_indexOf` function to always return -1, even if the promise is present in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last element from the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, which would cause the `array_indexOf` function to return a different index if the promise is present in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.shift();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first element from the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, which would cause the `array_indexOf` function to return a different index if the promise is
