  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_b
```
This would result in different behavior because `_b` is the second argument passed to the `logHypot` function, whereas `_a` is the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is the first argument passed to the `logHypot` function, whereas `_b` is the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs(b)` returns the absolute value of `b`, whereas `_a` is the first argument passed to the `logHypot` function.

DONE.
