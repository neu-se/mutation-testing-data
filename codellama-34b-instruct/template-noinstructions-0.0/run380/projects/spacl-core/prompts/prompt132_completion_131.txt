  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = '*'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` wildcard would match any verb, allowing all verbs to be allowed or denied, regardless of the specific verbs that were passed to the `allow` or `deny` methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = 'GET'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `GET` verb would always be allowed, regardless of whether it was explicitly allowed or denied by the `allow` or `deny` methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = 'POST'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `POST` verb would always be denied, regardless of whether it was explicitly allowed or denied by the `allow` or `deny` methods.

DONE.
