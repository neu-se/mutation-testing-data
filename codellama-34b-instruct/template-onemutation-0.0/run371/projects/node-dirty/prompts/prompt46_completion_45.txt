  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater(this._data.get(key))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would update the value in the `_data` map directly, rather than using the `set` method to update the value and persist it to disk. This could cause the in-memory cache to become out of sync with the data on disk, leading to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
