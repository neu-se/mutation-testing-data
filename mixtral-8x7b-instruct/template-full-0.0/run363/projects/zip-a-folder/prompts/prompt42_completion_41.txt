 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
zipArchive['glob']
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the `glob` property as a string key instead of using the dot notation, which may not be interpreted as a property access in some JavaScript environments (e.g., when the `glob` property is defined as a non-identifier name).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
zipArchive.bulk()
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the non-existent `bulk()` method on the `zipArchive` object, which would throw an error in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
zipArchive.directory(src, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the second argument of the `directory()` method to `true`, which creates a top-level directory for the `src` path in the archive. This may not be the intended behavior, as the original code sets
