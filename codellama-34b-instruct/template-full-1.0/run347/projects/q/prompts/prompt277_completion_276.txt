  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length === 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `>`, which means "greater than", while this replacement uses `===`, which means "equal to". This change would cause the code to resolve the promise with the first argument if `arguments.length` is equal to 2, rather than doing so if `arguments.length` is greater than 2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length % 2 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `>`, which means "greater than", while this replacement uses `%`, which is the modulus operator. This change would cause the code to resolve the promise with the first argument if `arguments.length` is even, rather than doing so if `arguments.length` is greater than 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length < 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code
