  I apologize for the mistake, my previous response is incorrect as there is no "PLACEHOLDER" in the code provided.

However, if you would like, I can still provide you with 3 different options for how this code could be changed, said changes are :

1. Add or replace the 'if' statement with an else statement.
```
      else
```
This would have a different behavior than the origanal code because with this change the else statement would replace the previous if statement, and when

2.  Add another if statement.
```
if (value === Object(value)) {
    return value;
```
This would have a different behavior because with this change we added another if statement , the function will return the else statement when the value is not an object, and when

3. modify the if statement to work with a different value.
```
if (Object.prototype.toString.call(value) === "[object Array]") {
```
This would have a different behavior because with this change the function return a different type of array, the function will return a value of type object when the value is not present or
