  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
hasStacks === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the logic of the `hasStacks` variable, causing the `stacks` array to be concatenated even if the `hasStacks` variable is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `stacks` array has any elements, regardless of the value of the `hasStacks` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof stacks !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `stacks` variable is defined, regardless of its value.

DONE.
