  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setTimeout` function takes a delay parameter, and 1 is a truthy value, so it will be coerced to 1 millisecond, making the timeout almost instantaneous.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"hello"` is a string, and it will be coerced to a number, which is `NaN`. When used as a delay parameter in `setTimeout`, `NaN` will be ignored, so the timeout will be instantaneous.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setTimeout` function takes a function as its first parameter, and `function () {}` is an anonymous function, which will be called after the specified delay.

DONE.
