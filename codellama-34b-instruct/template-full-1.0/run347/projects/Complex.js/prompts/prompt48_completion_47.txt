  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
`` `! Number.isFinite (a ['arg']) && Number.isFinite (a ['abs'])` `This would result in different behavior because it checks if `a['arg']` is finite, but does not check if `a['abs']` is finite, which leads to different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`Number.isFinite (a ['arg']) && Number.isFinite (a ['abs'])`
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if both `a['arg']` and `a['abs']` are finite, which leads to different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`!(a ['arg'] == Infinity && a ['abs'] == Infinity)`
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `a['arg']` is not equal to Infinity and `a['abs']` is not equal to Infinity, which leads to different results.
