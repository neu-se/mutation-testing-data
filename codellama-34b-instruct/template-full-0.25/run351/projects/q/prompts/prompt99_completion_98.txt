  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > length; index--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate in the opposite direction, potentially causing the loop to never terminate or to access out-of-bounds array indices.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index += 2; index < length; index++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip every other element in the array, potentially causing the loop to miss important data or to access out-of-bounds array indices.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index % 2 === 0; index < length; index++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only iterate over even-indexed elements in the array, potentially causing the loop to miss important data or to access out-of-bounds array indices.

DONE.
