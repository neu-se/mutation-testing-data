  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw reason;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a rejected promise with `reason` as the reason, while this code fragment throws an exception with `reason` as the message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a rejected promise with `reason` as the reason, while this code fragment returns a rejected promise with `undefined` as the reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a rejected promise with `reason` as the reason, while this code fragment returns a rejected promise with `null` as the reason.

DONE.
