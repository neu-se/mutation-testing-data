  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clothes, games, illnesses, misc, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be included in the array of words to be checked for pluralization, which would cause the `plural` function to return the original word unchanged, instead of adding an "s" to the end.
