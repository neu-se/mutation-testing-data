  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ insert: length }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` operation would be performed instead of the `delete` operation, which would result in the insertion of a new character at the current cursor position instead of deleting a character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ delete: length - 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` operation would be performed on one less character than the original code, which would result in the deletion of one less character than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ delete: length + 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` operation would be performed on one more character than the original code, which would result in the deletion of one more character than intended.

DONE.
