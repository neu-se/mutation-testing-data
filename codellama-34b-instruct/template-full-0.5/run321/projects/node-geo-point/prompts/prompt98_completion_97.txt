  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y
```
This would result in different behavior because `y` is a different variable than `x`, and the calculation would produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(θ)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cos(θ)` is a different function than `sin(θ)`, and the calculation would produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1 + atan2(y, x)
```
This would result in different behavior because `λ1` is a different variable than `λ2`, and the calculation would produce a different result.

DONE.
