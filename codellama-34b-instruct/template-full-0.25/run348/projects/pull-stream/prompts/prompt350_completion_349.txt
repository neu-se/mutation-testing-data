  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.test
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.test` is a function that returns a boolean value, whereas `prop` is an object that contains the `test` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.test()
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.test()` is a function call that returns a boolean value, whereas `prop` is an object that contains the `test` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.test.call(this, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.test.call(this, data)` is a function call that returns a boolean value, whereas `prop` is an object that contains the `test` function.

DONE.
