  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength` returns the length of the next operation, while `peekType` returns the type of the next operation. Using `peekLength` instead of `peekType` would cause the code to behave differently, potentially leading to incorrect results.
