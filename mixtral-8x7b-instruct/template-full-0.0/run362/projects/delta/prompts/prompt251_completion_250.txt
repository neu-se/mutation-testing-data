 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method would always return `Infinity` for the `otherIter`, causing the `diff` method to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method would always return `-1` for the `otherIter`, causing the `diff` method to skip processing the corresponding operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method would return an incremented value, causing the `diff` method to process more or fewer operations than expected, depending on the input.

DONE.
