  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, {}, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` variable was replaced with `0`, which would cause the `eachLine` method to always return the first line of the delta, regardless of the current index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, {}, -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` variable was replaced with `-1`, which would cause the `eachLine` method to always return the last line of the delta, regardless of the current index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, {}, i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` variable was replaced with `i + 1`, which would cause the `eachLine` method to always return the next line of the delta, regardless of the current index.

DONE.
