  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty.call(object, 'longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasOwnProperty` is a method of `Object.prototype`, and using `call` or `apply` to call it on a different object would check if that object has a `longitude` property, rather than the `object` itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object['longitude']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the `longitude` property of the `object` directly, rather than checking if it exists.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty(object, 'longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `object` has a `longitude` property, but it would also pass the `object` itself as the `this` value to the `hasOwnProperty` method, which could potentially cause issues if the method is not designed
