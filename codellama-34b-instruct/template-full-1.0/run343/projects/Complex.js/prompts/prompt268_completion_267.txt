  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abs()` method takes into account only the real part of the complex number, while the `abs()` method takes into account both the real and imaginary parts.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sqrt()` method takes the square root of the absolute value of the complex number, while `sqrt(this['re'] * 2)` would only take the square root of the real part of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] -= 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `exp()` method calculates the exponential function of the complex number, while `this['re'] -= 1` would subtract 1 from the real part of the complex number.

DONE.
