  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.insert !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `insert` property is a string, while the mutated code checks if it is not a string. This could cause the `insert` property to be treated differently in the code, depending on whether it is a string or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.insert === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `insert` property is a string, while the mutated code checks if it is a number. This could cause the `insert` property to be treated differently in the code, depending on whether it is a string or a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.insert === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `insert` property is a string, while the mutated code checks if it is an object. This could
