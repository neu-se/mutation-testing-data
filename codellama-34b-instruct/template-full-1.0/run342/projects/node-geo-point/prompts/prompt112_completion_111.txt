  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` and `Math.tan` have different properties and can produce different results when used in the given context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a specific value, while `Math.tan` is a function that takes an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * y
```
This would result in different behavior because `x * y` is a multiplication operation, while `Math.tan` is a function that takes an argument.

DONE.
