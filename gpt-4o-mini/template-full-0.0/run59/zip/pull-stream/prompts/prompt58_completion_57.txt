Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `done` is strictly equal to `undefined`, which would not account for cases where `done` is defined but falsy (e.g., `null`, `0`, or `false`), potentially allowing the function to proceed without a valid callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `done` is not `null` or `undefined`, which would allow the function to proceed even if `done` is a falsy value like `false`, thus incorrectly assuming a valid callback is provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `done` is strictly equal to `true`, which would prevent the function from executing if `done` is any other value, including a valid function, leading to a failure in handling the callback correctly.

DONE.
