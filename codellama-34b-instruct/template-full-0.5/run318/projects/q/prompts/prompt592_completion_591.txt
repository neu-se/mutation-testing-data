  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a fixed array of numbers instead of the original `arguments` object, which is a dynamic list of arguments passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a null value instead of the original `arguments` object, which would cause the function to fail if it relies on the `arguments` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a string value instead of the original `arguments` object, which would cause the function to fail if it relies on the `arguments` object.

DONE.
