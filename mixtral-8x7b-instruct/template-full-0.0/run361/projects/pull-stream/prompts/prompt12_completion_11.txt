 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would not stop when `i` is equal to `length`, and would continue until `i` is greater than `-1`, potentially causing an infinite loop or accessing an undefined array element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would run one extra time after reaching the end of the array, potentially causing an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would run one extra time, potentially causing an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
