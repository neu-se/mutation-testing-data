  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments)` would return an array of all the arguments passed to the function, while `array_slice(arguments, 1)` would return an array of all the arguments except the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 2)` would return an array of all the arguments except the first two, while `array_slice(arguments)` would return an array of all the arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 3)` would return an array of all the arguments except the first three, while `array_slice(arguments)` would return an array of all the arguments.

DONE.
