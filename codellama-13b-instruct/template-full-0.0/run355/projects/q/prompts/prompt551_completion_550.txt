  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would be called on the `result.value`, which would convert the value to uppercase.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would be called on the `result.value`, which would convert the value to lowercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property would be accessed on the `result.value`, which would return the length of the value.

DONE.
