  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` checks for the presence of a substring within a string, whereas `indexOf` checks for the presence of a substring within a string and returns its position.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.match
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` checks for the presence of a substring within a string and returns an array of matches, whereas `indexOf` returns the position of the first match.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` checks for the presence of a substring within a string and returns the position of the first match, whereas `indexOf` returns the position of the first match.

DONE.
