Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.startsWith('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the string starts with a slash instead of checking if it ends with a slash, which would lead to incorrect matching logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.includes('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the string contains a slash anywhere in it, rather than specifically checking if it ends with a slash, which could allow invalid paths to pass through.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the string is empty instead of checking if it ends with a slash, which would completely change the validation logic and potentially allow empty strings to be considered valid.

DONE.
