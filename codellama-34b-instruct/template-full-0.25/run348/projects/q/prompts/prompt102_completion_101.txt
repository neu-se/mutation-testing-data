  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would change the value of the `basis` variable, which is used in the `reduce` method to accumulate the values of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would change the value of the `basis` variable, which is used in the `reduce` method to accumulate the values of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would change the value of the `basis` variable, which is used in the `reduce` method to accumulate the values of the array.

DONE.
