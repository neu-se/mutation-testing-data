  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ value: 0 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `value` property of the `newOp` object is being set to 0, which would cause the line to evaluate to false in the `if` statement and skip the rest of the code inside the block.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ value: 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `value` property of the `newOp` object is being set to 1, which would cause the line to evaluate to true in the `if` statement and execute the code inside the block.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ value: 'foo' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `value` property of the `newOp` object is being set to the string 'foo', which would cause the line to evaluate to true in the `if` statement and execute the code inside the block.

DONE.
