  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes != null
```
This would result in different behavior because if the `insert` property of the operation is `null`, the original code would still consider it a valid insert operation, while the replaced code would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes === null
```
This would result in different behavior because if the `insert` property of the operation is not `null`, the original code would still consider it a valid insert operation, while the replaced code would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes && op.attributes.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because if the `insert` property of the operation is an empty array, the original code would still consider it a valid insert operation, while the replaced code would not.

DONE.
