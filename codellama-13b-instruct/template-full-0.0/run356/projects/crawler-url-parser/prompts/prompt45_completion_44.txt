  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr, false, false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse` function would be called with different arguments, which would result in different parsing behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr, true, false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse` function would be called with different arguments, which would result in different parsing behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr, false, true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse` function would be called with different arguments, which would result in different parsing behavior.

DONE.
