  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memo' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add an "s" to the end of the word, regardless of the word's plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memo' + 'es'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add "es" to the end of the word, regardless of the word's plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memo' + 's' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add "ss" to the end of the word, regardless of the word's plural form.

DONE.
