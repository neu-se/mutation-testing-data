  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof setTimeout === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setTimeout` function is often used to emulate the behavior of `setImmediate`, but it has a different implementation and may not have the same effect in all cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof requestAnimationFrame === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestAnimationFrame` is a similar function to `setImmediate`, but it is only supported in some browsers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof requestIdleCallback === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestIdleCallback` is a similar function to `setImmediate`, but it is only supported in some browsers and has a different implementation.
