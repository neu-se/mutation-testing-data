  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the backslash character is not a valid path separator in the context of the `Matcher` class, and would cause the `compile` function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the forward slash character is not a valid path separator in the context of the `Matcher` class, and would cause the `compile` function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the double backslash character is not a valid path separator in the context of the `Matcher` class, and would cause the `compile` function to throw an error.

DONE.
