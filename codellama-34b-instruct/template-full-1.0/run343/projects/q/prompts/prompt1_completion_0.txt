  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof boostrap != "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the boolean operator is reversed, so if "bootstrap" is not a function, the condition will be true, whereas in the original code, if "bootstrap" is a function, the condition will be true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof bootstrap !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison operator is changed, so if "bootstrap" is not undefined, the condition will be true, whereas in the original code, if "bootstrap" is a function, the condition will be true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"function" !== typeof bootstrap
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison operator is changed, so if "function" is not equal to the type of "bootstrap", the condition will be true, whereas in the original code, if "bootstrap" is a function, the condition will be true.

DONE.
