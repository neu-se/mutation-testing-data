 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q(object).apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `dispatch` is a method specifically added to Q Promises to handle messages in a future turn, while `apply` is a native Array method that is not aware of the Q Promise semantics.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.resolve(object).dispatch
