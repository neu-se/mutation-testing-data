  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`null`
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would return `null` instead of invoking the `cb` function, which could cause issues in the program's control flow and behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`cb`
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would invoke the `cb` function twice, which could cause unexpected side effects and errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`cb(undefined)`
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would invoke the `cb` function with an undefined value, which could cause unexpected behavior in the program's control flow and behavior.

DONE.
