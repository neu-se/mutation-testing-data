  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
priority
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is missing, which would cause the condition to always evaluate to `false`, even if `priority` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!priority && b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is added, which would cause the condition to evaluate to `false` if `priority` is `false`, even if `b` is `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
priority || b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is added, which would cause the condition to evaluate to `true` if `priority` is `true`, even if `b` is `false`.

DONE.
