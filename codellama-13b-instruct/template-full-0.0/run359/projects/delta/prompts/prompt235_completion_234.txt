  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(opLength + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `otherIter.next(opLength)` call would skip over the next operation in the `other` delta, while the `otherIter.next(opLength + 1)` call would include the next operation in the `other` delta. This could cause the `diff` function to produce different results, potentially leading to different behavior in the rest of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(opLength - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `otherIter.next(opLength)` call would include the previous operation in the `other` delta, while the `otherIter.next(opLength - 1)` call would skip over the previous operation in the `other` delta. This could cause the `diff` function to produce different results, potentially leading to different behavior in the rest of the code.
