  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.error
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.error` is not a function and would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.errors
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.errors` is not a function and would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.difference(Q.error, Q.error)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.difference` is not a function and would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
