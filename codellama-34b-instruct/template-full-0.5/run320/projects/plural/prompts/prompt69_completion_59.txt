  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memo', 'memo'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the same word for both singular and plural forms, which is incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memo', 'memoes'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a different word for the plural form, which is incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memo', 'memos'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the same word for both singular and plural forms, which is incorrect.

DONE.
