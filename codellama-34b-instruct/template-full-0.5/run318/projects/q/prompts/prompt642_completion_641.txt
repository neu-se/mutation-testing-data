  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[args, name]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, which could cause unexpected results in the `dispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args.reverse()]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` array is reversed, which could cause unexpected results in the `dispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args.concat(["extra_arg"])]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument is added to the `args` array, which could cause unexpected results in the `dispatch` method.

DONE.
