  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `φ1` and `φ2` are different latitudes, and using `φ1` instead of `φ2` in the calculation would lead to an incorrect calculation of the bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 + 10
```
This would result in different behavior because adding 10 to `φ2` would change the point of origin for the calculation of the bearing, leading to a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cos(φ2)` is not the same as `φ2`, and using `cos(φ2)` instead of `φ2` would change the calculation of the bearing.

DONE.
