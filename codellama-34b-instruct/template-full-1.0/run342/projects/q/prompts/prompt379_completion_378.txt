  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var wrongCallback = function() {
    if (newValue) {
        deferred.notify(newValue);
    }
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement is missing a closing `}` brace, causing a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var wrongCallback = function() {
    deferred.notify("wrong value");
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify()` method is being called with a hardcoded string value, rather than the `newValue` variable that is passed into the callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var wrongCallback = function() {
    deferred.reject(new Error("rejected"));
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject()` method is being called with an error object, which will cause the promise to be rejected, rather than the `deferred.notify()`
