  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(2).attributes || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip over the first character in the string, potentially causing the code to miss important data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(0).attributes || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an empty object for the attributes, potentially causing the code to fail to perform the desired operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(1).attributes || { foo: 'bar' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a new attribute to the object, potentially causing the code to behave in an unexpected way.

DONE.
