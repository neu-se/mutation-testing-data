  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would return `true` if there is a next operation, instead of `false` if there is not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would return `true` if there are no operations, instead of `false` if there are operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index >= this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would return `true` if the index is greater than or equal to the number of operations, instead of `false` if there are operations at the current index or beyond.

DONE.
