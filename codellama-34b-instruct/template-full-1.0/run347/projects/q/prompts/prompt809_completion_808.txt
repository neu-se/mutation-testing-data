  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `callback === null` is a strict equality check that will only return `true` if `callback` is actually `null`, whereas the original code uses a negation operator to check if `callback` is either `null` or `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof callback !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof callback !== "function"` checks if `callback` is not a function, whereas the original code checks if `callback` is a function or if it has a method called `apply`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!callback.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `!callback.apply` checks if `callback.apply` is falsy, whereas the original code checks if `callback` is either `null` or `undefined`.

DONE.
