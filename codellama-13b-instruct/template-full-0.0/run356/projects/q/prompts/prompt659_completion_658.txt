  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is a special object that is only available within functions, and it is not a valid argument for the `array_slice` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function expects an array as its second argument, and passing an empty array would result in an empty array being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function expects an array as its second argument, and passing an array with three elements would result in a new array being returned with only the first three elements of the original array.

DONE.
