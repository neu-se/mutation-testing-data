  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array would be one element shorter than expected, which could cause the `nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver())` line to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array would have three extra elements than expected, which could cause the `nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver())` line to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array would have a string element instead of a number, which could cause the `nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver())` line to throw an error.

DONE.
