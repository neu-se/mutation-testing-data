  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a different slice of the `arguments` array, which could lead to unexpected results in the `dispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[arguments[1], arguments[2]]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a different array than the original code, which could lead to unexpected results in the `dispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[arguments[1], arguments[3]]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a different array than the original code, which could lead to unexpected results in the `dispatch` method.

DONE.
