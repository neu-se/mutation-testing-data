  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the previous operation instead of the current one, which could cause the `next` method to return incorrect values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the next operation instead of the current one, which could cause the `next` method to return incorrect values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index + 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the operation after the next one, which could cause the `next` method to return incorrect values.

DONE.
