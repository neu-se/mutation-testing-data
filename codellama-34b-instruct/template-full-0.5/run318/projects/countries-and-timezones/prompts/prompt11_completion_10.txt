  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] = { [country]: { current: [], all: [] } };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign a new object to `result[country]` instead of merging the existing object with the new properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] = { ...result[country], [country]: { current: [], all: [] } };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would merge the existing object with the new properties using the spread operator instead of using `Object.assign`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] = Object.assign({}, result[country], { [country]: { current: [], all: [] } });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would merge the existing object with the new properties using `Object.assign` instead of using the spread operator.

DONE.
