  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(array)
```
This code fragment is a negation of the original code fragment, which means that it will have the opposite behavior. If the original code fragment returns `true` when `array` is not an array, the modified code fragment will return `false` when `array` is not an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length === 0
```
This code fragment checks if the length of the `array` is equal to 0, which means that it will return `true` if the `array` is empty. This behavior is different from the original code fragment, which returns `true` if `array` is not an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length > 0
```
This code fragment checks if the length of the `array` is greater than 0, which means that it will return `true` if the `array` is not empty. This behavior is different from the original code fragment
