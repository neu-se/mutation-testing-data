  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task, window
```
This would result in different behavior because `window` is a global object in the browser, and it would be different from `domain` which is a local variable in the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that is different from `domain` which is a local variable in the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task, null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that is different from `domain` which is a local variable in the function.

DONE.
