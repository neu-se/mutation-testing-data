  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a == 0` expression would always evaluate to `false`, even if `a` is not equal to zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b == 0` expression would always evaluate to `false`, even if `b` is not equal to zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a !== b` expression would always evaluate to `true`, even if `a` is equal to `b`.

DONE.
