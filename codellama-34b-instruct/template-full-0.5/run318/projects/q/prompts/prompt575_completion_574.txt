  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `continuer.call` would call the `continuer` function immediately, rather than binding it to a value and returning a new function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `continuer.apply` would call the `continuer` function immediately, rather than binding it to a value and returning a new function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `continuer.bind(null)` would bind the `continuer` function to `null`, rather than the expected value.

DONE.
