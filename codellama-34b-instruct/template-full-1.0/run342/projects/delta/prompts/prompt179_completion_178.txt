  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns an op object, but the replaced code fragment returns null, which could cause type errors or unexpected behavior in the code that uses this method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns an op object, but the replaced code fragment returns a number, which could cause type errors or unexpected behavior in the code that uses this method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns an op object, but the replaced code fragment returns an empty object, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses this method.

DONE.
