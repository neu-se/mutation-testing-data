  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length()` method returns the number of characters in a string, while the `line` variable is a `Delta` object and does not have a `length()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.ops
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ops` property is a list of operations that have been applied to the `Delta` object, and is not a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.insert("Hello, world!")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert()` method inserts a new operation into the `Delta` object, and would not be a valid replacement for the `line` variable.

DONE.
