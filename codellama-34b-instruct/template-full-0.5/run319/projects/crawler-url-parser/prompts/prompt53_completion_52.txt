  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl, parsedUrl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because `parsedUrl.protocol` is a different value than `parsedBaseUrl`, which could cause the `URL.format()` method to produce a different URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl, parsedUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because `parsedUrl.host` is a different value than `parsedBaseUrl`, which could cause the `URL.format()` method to produce a different URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl, parsedUrl.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because `parsedUrl.pathname` is a different value than `parsedBaseUrl`, which could cause the `URL.format()` method to produce a different URL.

DONE.
