  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the given promise, unchanged, while the new code fragment returns a promise that is always fulfilled with the value `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the given promise, unchanged, while the new code fragment returns a promise that is always fulfilled with the value `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Test error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the given promise, unchanged, while the new code fragment returns a promise that is always rejected with the error "Test error".

DONE.
