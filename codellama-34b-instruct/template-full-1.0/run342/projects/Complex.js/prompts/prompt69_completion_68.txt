  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if and b !== undefined) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the parentheses are imbalanced, causing a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (a === undefined || a === null) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always throw an error, regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (a === undefined || b === undefined) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error if either `a` or `b` is undefined, rather than only when both are undefined.

DONE.
