  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the first element of the `attempt1` array instead of the second element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the first element of the `attempt1` array instead of the second element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the fourth element of the `attempt1` array instead of the second element.

DONE.
