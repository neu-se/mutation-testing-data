  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `pop()` on `buffer` instead of `arr`. `buffer` is a string, so `pop()` will remove the last character from it, while `arr.pop()` will remove the last element from the `arr` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `pop()` on `buffer` instead of `arr`. `buffer` is a string, so `pop()` will remove the last character from it, while `arr.shift()` will remove the first element from the `arr` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.slice(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `pop()` on `buffer` instead of `arr`. `buffer` is a string, so `pop()` will remove the last character from it, while `arr
