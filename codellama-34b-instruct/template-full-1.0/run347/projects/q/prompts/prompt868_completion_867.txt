  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` method would be called instead of `deferred.resolve`, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function and would cause an error to be thrown when the function is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log
```
This would result in different behavior because the `console.log` method does not return a promise and would therefore not be a valid replacement for the `deferred.resolve` method.

DONE.
