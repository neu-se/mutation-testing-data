  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the array is different, so the value returned by the function would be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value returned by the function would be different, as the index of the array is incremented by 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value returned by the function would be different, as the index of the array is multiplied by 2.

DONE.
