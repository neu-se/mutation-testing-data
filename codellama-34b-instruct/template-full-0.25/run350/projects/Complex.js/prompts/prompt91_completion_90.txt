  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseFloat(tokens[i + 1])
```
This would result in different behavior because `tokens[i + 1]` is undefined, causing `parseFloat` to return NaN.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `tokens[i + 1]` is a string, and the code is expecting a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `tokens[i + 1]` is a string, and the code is expecting a number.

DONE.
