  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `any` function would return a resolved promise with the value `null`, instead of a rejected promise with the original error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `any` function would return a resolved promise with the value `undefined`, instead of a rejected promise with the original error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("Different error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `any` function would return a rejected promise with a different error message, instead of the original error.

DONE.
