  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 3 ? '-' : '') + '1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the modulo operator is used with a different divisor, which would change the resulting sign.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + '2'
```
This would result in different behavior because a different constant is added to the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + 'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because a different variable is added to the result.

DONE.
