  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.exit(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.exit(1)` would terminate the process with an error code of 1, whereas the original code would continue executing the rest of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.exit(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.exit(0)` would terminate the process with an error code of 0, whereas the original code would continue executing the rest of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("This is a test error");
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw new Error("This is a test error")` would throw an error with the message "This is a test error", whereas the original code would continue executing the rest of the program.

DONE.
