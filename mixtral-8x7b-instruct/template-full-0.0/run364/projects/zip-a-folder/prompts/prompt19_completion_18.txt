 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
targetBasePath, fs.constants.R_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the `W_OK` check for write permission is missing, which might cause issues when trying to write the output file in the specified target base path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
targetBasePath, fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the `R_OK` check for read permission is missing, which might cause issues when trying to access the source directory.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
targetBasePath, fs.constants.X_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the `X_OK` check is for execute permission, which is not relevant in this context. This would cause the permission check to always fail, potentially hiding real permission issues.

DONE.
