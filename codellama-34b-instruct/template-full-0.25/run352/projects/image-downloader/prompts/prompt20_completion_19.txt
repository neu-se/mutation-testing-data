  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isRelative
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.isRelative` checks if the path is relative, not absolute, and would cause the code to reject the promise with a different error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isAbsolute(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.isAbsolute` checks if the path is absolute, and would cause the code to reject the promise with a different error message if the path is not absolute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isAbsolute(options.dest) && path.isAbsolute(options.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if both the `dest` and `url` paths are absolute, and would cause the code to reject the promise with a different error message if either path is not absolute.

DONE.
