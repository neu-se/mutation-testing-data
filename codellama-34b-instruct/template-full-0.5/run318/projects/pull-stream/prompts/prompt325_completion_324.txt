  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if `end` is truthy, while this code fragment checks if it is strictly equal to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if `end` is truthy, while this code fragment checks if it is not strictly equal to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if `end` is truthy, while this code fragment checks if it is falsy.

DONE.
