  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(() => { if (cb) cb(); this.emit('drain'); }, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` with a delay of 0 is not the same as `setImmediate`, which would execute the callback immediately after the current execution context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.nextTick(() => { if (cb) cb(); this.emit('drain'); });
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.nextTick` would execute the callback in the next event loop iteration, which may not be immediate.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (cb) cb(); this.emit('drain');
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would be executed immediately, without waiting for the next event loop iteration.

DONE.
