  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider the next operation in the `Iterator` instead of the current one, potentially causing the `peekLength` method to return an incorrect value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider the previous operation in the `Iterator` instead of the current one, potentially causing the `peekLength` method to return an incorrect value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index] + this.offset
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider the current operation in the `Iterator` plus the offset, potentially causing the `peekLength` method to return an incorrect value.

DONE.
