  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finish'
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'finish' event is emitted when all data has been flushed to the underlying system, while the 'error' event is emitted when there is an error during the flushing process.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'close' event is emitted after the 'finish' event, and is used to indicate that all operations have been completed and the stream is no longer readable or writable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'end' event is emitted when there is no more data to be consumed from the stream, while the 'finish' event is emitted when all data has been flushed to the underlying system.

DONE.
