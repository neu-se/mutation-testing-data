  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\t'
```
This will cause the `split` method to split the input string on tab characters instead of newline characters, which may cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This will cause the `split` method to split the input string on empty strings, which may cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This will cause the `split` method to split the input string on spaces, which may cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
