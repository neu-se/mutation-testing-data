  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, data
```
This change will cause the `next` function to always return the `data` argument, regardless of whether the `end` argument is truthy or not. This could potentially cause the `next` function to return data that is not intended to be returned, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, null
```
This change will cause the `next` function to always return `null`, regardless of whether the `end` argument is truthy or not. This could potentially cause the `next` function to return a value that is not intended to be returned, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, undefined
```
This change will cause the `next` function to always return `undefined`, regardless of whether the `end` argument is truthy or not. This could potentially cause the `next` function to return a value that is not intended to be returned, which
