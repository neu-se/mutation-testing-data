  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path.basename` function returns the last component of a path, while `path.extname` returns the extension of a path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path.dirname` function returns the directory name of a path, while `path.extname` returns the extension of a path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isAbsolute
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path.isAbsolute` function returns whether a path is absolute or not, while `path.extname` returns the extension of a path.

DONE.
