  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the longitude value of `point1` instead of `point2`, which could cause the calculation to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the latitude value of `point2` instead of the longitude value, which could cause the calculation to produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() * 360
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a random value instead of the longitude value of `point2`, which could cause the calculation to produce incorrect results.

DONE.
