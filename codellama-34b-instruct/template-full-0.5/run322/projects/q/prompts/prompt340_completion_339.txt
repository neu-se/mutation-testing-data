  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "fulfilled" state is not handled in the original code, and the `then` method would not be called for fulfilled promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "rejected" || inspected.state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "rejected" and "pending" states would be handled differently than in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "settled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "settled" state is not handled in the original code, and the `then` method would not be called for settled promises.

DONE.
