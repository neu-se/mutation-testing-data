Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finish'
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'finish' event is emitted when the writable stream has finished writing all data, which may occur before the zip archive is fully finalized, potentially leading to incomplete or corrupted output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'data'
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'data' event is emitted when there is data available to read from the stream, which does not indicate that the writing process has completed, thus failing to signal when the zip operation is actually done.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because using 'error' would mean that the promise resolves on an error event, which is not the intended behavior; it would cause the operation to resolve prematurely in case of an error, rather than rejecting the promise as expected.

DONE.
