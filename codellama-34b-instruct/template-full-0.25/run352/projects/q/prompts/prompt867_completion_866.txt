  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` expects an error object or a string as its argument, but `value` is a promise that may resolve to any value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` expects a value that the promise should resolve to, but `value` is a promise that may resolve to any value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` expects a value that the promise should notify with, but `value` is a promise that may resolve to any value.

DONE.
