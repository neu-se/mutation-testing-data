  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next operation in the other iterator is an insert, while this code fragment checks if it is a delete.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next operation in the other iterator is an insert, while this code fragment checks if the length of the next operation is greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next operation in the other iterator is an insert, while this code fragment checks if it is a retain.

DONE.
