  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!op
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation operator (!) would reverse the truthiness of the `op` variable, potentially causing the `promiseDispatch` method to be called with an incorrect value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operation would change the value of `op` variable, potentially causing the `promiseDispatch` method to be called with an incorrect value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(op)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.floor` function would round the value of `op` down to the nearest integer, potentially causing the `promiseDispatch` method to be called with an incorrect value.

DONE.
