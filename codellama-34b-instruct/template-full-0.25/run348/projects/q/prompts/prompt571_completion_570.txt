  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` and `apply` are different methods of the `Function` object, and they have different behaviors when it comes to handling the `this` context and the arguments passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function that is bound to a specific `this` context and a specific set of arguments, whereas `apply` and `call` simply call the function with the specified `this` context and arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` with a `null` context would set the `this` context of the function to the global object, whereas the original code sets the `this` context to the `makeGenerator` function.

DONE.
