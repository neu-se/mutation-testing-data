  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = null;
```
This change will cause the `insert` method to always return `null`, which is not the intended behavior of the method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = undefined;
```
This change will cause the `insert` method to always return `undefined`, which is not the intended behavior of the method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = 'foo';
```
This change will cause the `insert` method to always return the string `'foo'`, which is not the intended behavior of the method.

DONE.
