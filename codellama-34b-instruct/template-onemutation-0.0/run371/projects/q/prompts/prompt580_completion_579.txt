  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method is being called on the `continuer` function with the `this` value set to `continuer`, which is not the intended behavior. The `bind` method is used to create a new function that, when called, will call the original function with a specific `this` value and arguments provided either at call time or at bind time. In this case, the `this` value is being set to the `continuer` function itself, which is not what the original code intended.

DONE.
