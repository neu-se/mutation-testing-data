  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` method would return a value that is one more than the actual length of the operation, which could cause the `slice` method to return an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` method would return a value that is one less than the actual length of the operation, which could cause the `slice` method to return an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` method would return a value that is twice the actual length of the operation, which could cause the `slice` method to return an incorrect result.

DONE.
