  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(2).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting array would have one less element than the original, which could cause the `compile` function to fail to capture all of the necessary properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().join('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting string would have a different structure than the original, which could cause the `compile` function to fail to recognize the correct properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').reverse().slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting array would have a different order than the original, which could cause the `compile` function to fail to capture the correct properties.

DONE.
