  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN()` and `isInfinite()` have different return values for the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['abs']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `abs()` returns the absolute value of the complex number, while `isNaN()` and `isInfinite()` check the value of the real and imaginary parts separately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['negate']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `negate()` negates the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, while `isNaN()` and `isInfinite()` check the value of the real and imaginary parts separately.

DONE.
