  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a null value, rather than the original value returned by the `Q(object)` promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with an undefined value, rather than the original value returned by the `Q(object)` promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the `Q` object, rather than the original value returned by the `Q(object)` promise.

DONE.
