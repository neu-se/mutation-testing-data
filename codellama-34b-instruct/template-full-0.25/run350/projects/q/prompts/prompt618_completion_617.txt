  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the wrong key to the `get` method, potentially causing the promise to be resolved with the wrong value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different key to the `get` method, potentially causing the promise to be resolved with the wrong value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key * 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different key to the `get` method, potentially causing the promise to be resolved with the wrong value.

DONE.
