  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, args.slice(1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a slice of the `args` array starting from the second element, instead of passing the `args` array as is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, args.concat([1])]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a concatenation of the `args` array and the array `[1]`, instead of passing the `args` array as is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, args.map(function(x) { return x + 1; })]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a mapped version of the `args` array, where each element is incremented by 1, instead of passing the `args` array as is.

DONE.
