 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a new arrow function, which may have different context and behavior compared to the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a random number instead of a function, causing the `dispatch` method to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.makeNodeResolver
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the parentheses, changing the meaning of the expression from invoking a function to referencing a property.

DONE.
