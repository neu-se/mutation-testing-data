  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.nextTick.bind(process)
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.nextTick.bind(process)` is a bound function that is not the same as the original `process.nextTick` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` is a different function than `process.nextTick` and may have different timing and behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve().then
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve().then` is a promise that is resolved immediately and then executed, whereas `process.nextTick` is a function that is executed after the current tick.

DONE.
