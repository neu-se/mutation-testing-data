  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseInt
```
This would result in different behavior because parseInt() would return the integer part of the parsed string, whereas parseFloat() returns a floating-point number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String(c)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the character 'c' to a string, whereas parseFloat() expects a string representing a floating-point number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the parser to fail, whereas parseFloat() would return a valid floating-point number.

DONE.
