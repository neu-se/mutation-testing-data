  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the number of in-flight writes is less than or equal to 0, while the modified code fragment checks if it is strictly less than 0. If the number of in-flight writes is 0, the modified code fragment would not execute the code block within the `if` statement, while the original code fragment would.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the number of in-flight writes is less than or equal to 0, while the modified code fragment checks if it is greater than 0. If the number of in-flight writes is 0, the modified code fragment would execute the code block within the `if` statement, while the original code fragment would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
