  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.min` returns the smallest value among its arguments, while `Math.max` returns the largest value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - length
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.min` takes the minimum of the two arguments, while `index - length` subtracts the length from the index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - index
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.min` takes the minimum of the two arguments, while `length - index` subtracts the index from the length.

DONE.
