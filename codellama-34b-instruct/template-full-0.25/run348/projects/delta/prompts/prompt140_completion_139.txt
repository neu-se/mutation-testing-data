  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const firstOther = otherIter.peek();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek` method returns the next value in the iteration without advancing the iterator, whereas the original code uses `next` to retrieve the next value and advance the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const firstOther = otherIter.next();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method retrieves the next value in the iteration and advances the iterator, whereas the original code uses `peek` to retrieve the next value without advancing the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const firstOther = otherIter.peek(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek` method with an argument of 1 would return the next value in the iteration without advancing the iterator, whereas the original code uses `peek` with no arguments to retrieve the next value without advancing the iterator.

DONE.
