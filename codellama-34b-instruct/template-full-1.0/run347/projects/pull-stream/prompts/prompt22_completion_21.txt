  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `read` function to be called with the value `1` as the first argument, rather than the actual value of `ref[0]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `read` function to be called with `null` as the first argument, rather than the actual value of `ref[0]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{read: read}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `read` function to be called with an object with a `read` property as the first argument, rather than the actual value of `ref[0]`.

DONE.
