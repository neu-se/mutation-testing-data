  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` event is emitted when the write stream is closed, whereas the `drain` event is emitted when the write stream is drained. Using `close` instead of `drain` would cause the `Dirty` class to emit the `close` event when the write stream is closed, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that uses the `Dirty` class.

DONE.
