  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `result` variable is being modified, which would cause the `Q.any` function to return a different value than it would have with the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.resolve(result)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise.resolve` method is being called, which would cause the `Q.any` function to return a resolved promise with the value of `result`, whereas the original code fragment would have returned a rejected promise with the value of `err` or a new error object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.reject(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise.reject` method is being called, which would cause the `Q.any` function to return a rejected promise with the value of `err`, whereas the original code fragment would have returned a resolved promise with the value of
