  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the input field, which would likely cause the `unique` function to produce incorrect output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it subtracts 1 from the input field, which would likely cause the `unique` function to produce incorrect output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the input field to lowercase, which would likely cause the `unique` function to produce incorrect output.

DONE.
