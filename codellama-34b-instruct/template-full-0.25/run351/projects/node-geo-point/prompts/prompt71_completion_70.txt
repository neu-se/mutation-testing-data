  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.PI` constant is added to the `θ` variable, which would change the direction of the bearing calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `θ` variable is multiplied by 2, which would change the magnitude of the bearing calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ - Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.PI` constant is subtracted from the `θ` variable, which would change the direction of the bearing calculation.

DONE.
