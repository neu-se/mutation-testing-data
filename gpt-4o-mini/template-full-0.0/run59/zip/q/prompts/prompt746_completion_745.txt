Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function onProgress() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the progress updates would be ignored entirely, preventing any notifications about the progress of the promises from being sent.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly call the fulfillment handler instead of the progress handler, leading to potential incorrect handling of promise states and ignoring progress updates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the progress handling functionality altogether, meaning that no progress notifications would be sent, which could lead to a lack of feedback in promise resolution processes.

DONE.
