  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!num
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation operator `!` would invert the truthiness of the value of `num`, causing the `plural` function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num++
```
This would result in different behavior because the post-increment operator `++` would increment the value of `num` by 1, causing the `plural` function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add 1 to the value of `num`, causing the `plural` function to return a different result.

DONE.
