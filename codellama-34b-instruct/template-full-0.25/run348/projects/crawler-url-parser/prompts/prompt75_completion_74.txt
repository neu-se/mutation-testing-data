  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a` element is not the same as the `base` element, and the `href` attribute of the `a` element may not be the same as the `href` attribute of the `base` element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `href` attribute of the `a` element would be set to the current URL with a fragment identifier, which may not be the same as the `href` attribute of the `base` element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'href'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `href` attribute of the `a` element would be set to the current URL, which may not be the same as the `href` attribute of the `base` element.

DONE.
