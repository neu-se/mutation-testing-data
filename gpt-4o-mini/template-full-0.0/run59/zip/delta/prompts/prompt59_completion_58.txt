Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to access the length of the `ops` array instead of the `ops` property of the object, potentially leading to an undefined value being assigned to `this.ops`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the first element of the `ops` array (if it exists) to `this.ops`, rather than the entire array, which could lead to unexpected results when trying to process the operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove and return the last element of the `ops` array instead of assigning the entire array to `this.ops`, which would result in losing data and potentially causing errors in subsequent operations.

DONE.
