  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a complex number, while `a + 1` is a real number. The `sin`, `cos`, and `tan` functions would produce different results for a real number input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a complex number, while `a * 2` is a complex number with twice the magnitude. The `sin`, `cos`, and `tan` functions would produce different results for a complex number input with twice the magnitude.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a complex number, while `a / 2` is a complex number with half the magnitude. The `sin`, `cos`, and `tan` functions would produce different results for a complex number input
