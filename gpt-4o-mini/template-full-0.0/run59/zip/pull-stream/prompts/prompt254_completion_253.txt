Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read(true, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly passes `true` to `_read`, which may cause the stream to abort prematurely instead of processing the next chunk of data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream()
```
This would result in different behavior because it skips the processing of the current chunk and directly moves to the next stream, potentially losing data that should have been processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read(null, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls `_read` with `null` and the callback directly, which may lead to incorrect handling of the stream's end condition and could cause the callback to be invoked with unexpected results.

DONE.
