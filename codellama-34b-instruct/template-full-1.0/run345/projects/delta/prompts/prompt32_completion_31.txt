  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base
```
This would result in different behavior because the `base` object is being mutated instead of the `attr` object, which could cause unexpected consequences in the code that uses the `AttributeMap` module.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is not an object, and the `Object.keys()` method would throw an error if it is used on a non-object value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attr = {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attr` object is being overwritten with an empty object, which could cause unexpected consequences in the code that uses the `AttributeMap` module.

DONE.
