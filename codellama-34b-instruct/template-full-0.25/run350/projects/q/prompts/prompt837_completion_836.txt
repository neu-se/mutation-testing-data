  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method would create a new function with a different `this` context, potentially causing the `onUnhandledError` function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method would invoke the `onUnhandledError` function immediately, rather than passing it as a callback to `nextTick`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method would invoke the `onUnhandledError` function immediately, rather than passing it as a callback to `nextTick`.

DONE.
