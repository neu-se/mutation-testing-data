  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice method would start at the third element of the `ops` array, instead of the second element, which would cause the `concat` method to produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice method would return a new array containing only the first element of the `ops` array, instead of the entire array, which would cause the `concat` method to produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice method would return a new array containing only the second element of the `ops` array, instead of the entire array, which would cause the `concat` method to produce a different result.

DONE.
