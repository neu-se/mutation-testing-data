  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `φ1` is the original latitude value, while `φ2` is the resulting latitude value after the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI / 180 * φ2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be multiplying the result of the sin calculation by an extra factor of `Math.PI / 180`, which would give a different result than the original calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-φ2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be negating the resulting latitude value, which would give a different bearing than the original calculation.

DONE.
