  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(θ + 90) % 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 90 degrees to the bearing would cause the projected course to be different from the original.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(θ - 90) % 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 90 degrees from the bearing would cause the projected course to be different from the original.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(θ + 180) % 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 180 degrees to the bearing would cause the projected course to be different from the original.

DONE.
