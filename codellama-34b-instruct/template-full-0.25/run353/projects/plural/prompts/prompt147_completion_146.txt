  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first element of the `rule` array, which is a regular expression, instead of the second element, which is the replacement string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1] + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append an extra 's' to the end of the replacement string, which would not be correct in all cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1].replace(/s$/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove any 's' characters from the end of the replacement string, which would not be correct in all cases.

DONE.
