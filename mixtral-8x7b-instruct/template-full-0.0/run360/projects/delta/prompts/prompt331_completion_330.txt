 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
baseOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the code now only considers the `insert` property of `baseOp`, potentially ignoring other properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` method would not handle the case where `op.retain` is an object, as it would return `null` instead of the actual data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
