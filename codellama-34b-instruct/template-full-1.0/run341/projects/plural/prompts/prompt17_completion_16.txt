  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag was added, which causes the regex to match all occurrences of the pattern in the input string, instead of just the first.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag was added, which causes the regex to ignore the case of the input string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/m
```
This would result in different behavior because the `m` flag was added, which causes the regex to match across multiple lines.

DONE.
