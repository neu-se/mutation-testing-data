  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would have rejected the promise, while `deferred.resolve` would have resolved it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would have rejected the promise, while `deferred.notify` would have notified the progress of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would have rejected the promise, while `undefined` would have left the promise unresolved.

DONE.
