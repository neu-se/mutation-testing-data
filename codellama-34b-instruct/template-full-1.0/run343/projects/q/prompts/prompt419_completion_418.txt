  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` would refer to the global object, rather than the `inspect` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.inspect` would refer to the `inspect` function, but with the context of the global object, rather than the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect` would refer to the global `inspect` function, rather than the `inspect` function on the promise object.

DONE.
