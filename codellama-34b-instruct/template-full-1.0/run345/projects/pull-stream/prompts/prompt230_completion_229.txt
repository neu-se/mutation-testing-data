  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test === 'expected value'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check whether the `test` value is equal to the expected value, whereas the original code fragment `test` would evaluate to a truthy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test !== 'expected value'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check whether the `test` value is not equal to the expected value, whereas the original code fragment `test` would evaluate to a truthy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.includes('expected value')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check whether the `test` value includes the expected value as a substring, whereas the original code fragment `test` would evaluate to a truthy value.

DONE.
