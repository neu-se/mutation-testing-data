  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match` variable is now being checked for inequality with `null` rather than equality, which would flip the outcome of the `if` statement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match` variable is now being checked for a length of 0 rather than being null, which could result in the `if` statement returning `true` even though there is no match.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match[0] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match` variable is now being checked for a value of `undefined` at the first index rather than being null, which could result in the `if` statement returning `true` even though there is no match.

DONE.
