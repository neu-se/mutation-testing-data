  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the truthiness of the `end` variable, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` regardless of the value of `end`. This would cause the function to always return `cb(null, generate())`, even if `end` is truthy.

DONE.
