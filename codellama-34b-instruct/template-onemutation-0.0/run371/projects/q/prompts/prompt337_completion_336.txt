  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the "rejected" state, while the new code fragment checks for the "fulfilled" state. This would cause the `reject` function to be called in the `else` block, which would result in a different behavior.

DONE.
