  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate one more time than it should, potentially leading to an infinite loop or other unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate one fewer time than it should, potentially leading to missed iterations or other unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate twice as many times as it should, potentially leading to duplicated or otherwise unexpected behavior.

DONE.
