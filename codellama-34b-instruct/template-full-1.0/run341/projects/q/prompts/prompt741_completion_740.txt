  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to resolve immediately without waiting for the other promises to fulfill.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to reject immediately without waiting for the other promises to fulfill.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to notify immediately without waiting for the other promises to fulfill.

DONE.
