  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/default\.[a-z]+$/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the default file extension, while the new code fragment removes the whole default file name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/default\.[a-z]+$/, '/index'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the default file extension, while the new code fragment replaces the default file name with "index".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/default\.[a-z]+$/, '/default'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the default file extension, while the new code fragment replaces the default file name with "default".

DONE.
