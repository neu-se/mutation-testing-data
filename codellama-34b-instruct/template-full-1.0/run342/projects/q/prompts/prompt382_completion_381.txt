  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nearer
```
This would result in different behavior because `nearer` returns the nearest resolution value of the promise, while `Q` returns the promise itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when
```
This would result in different behavior because `when` is a different method from `Q` that is used to schedule a function to be called with a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.inspect
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect` returns a promise tracking the state of the promise and its dependent promises, while `Q` returns a new promise that is resolved with the given value.

DONE.
