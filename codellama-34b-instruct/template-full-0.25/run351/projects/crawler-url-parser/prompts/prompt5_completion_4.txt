  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return `true`, even if the URL does not contain any illegal characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!_has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return `false`, even if the URL does contain illegal characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to check the URL of the current link, rather than the base URL.

DONE.
