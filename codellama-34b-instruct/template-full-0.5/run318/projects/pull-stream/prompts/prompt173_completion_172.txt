  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray(array)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the result of the `Array.isArray` check, causing the code to enter the `if` block when `array` is actually an array, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `array` is empty, rather than checking if it is an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof array === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `array` is an object, rather than checking if it is an array.

DONE.
