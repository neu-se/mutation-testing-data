  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.of
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.of` is a method that creates a new array from a variable number of arguments, whereas `Array.from` is a method that creates a new array from an existing array-like object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.map
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype.map` is a method that creates a new array by applying a function to each element of an existing array, whereas `Array.from` is a method that creates a new array from an existing array-like object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.reduce
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype.reduce` is a method that applies a function to each element of an existing array to reduce it to a single value, whereas `Array.from` is a method that creates a new array from an existing array-like object.

DONE.
