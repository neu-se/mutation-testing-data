  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was intended to be a function that takes a number as an argument and returns a number, while the replacement code fragment is a constant value that would cause the function to always return 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was intended to be a function that takes a number as an argument and returns a number, while the replacement code fragment is a constant value that would cause the function to always return 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was intended to be a function that takes a number as an argument and returns a number, while the replacement code fragment is a constant value that would cause the function to always return -1.

DONE.
