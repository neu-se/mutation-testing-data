  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.inspect()` is an object, not a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.resolve()` is not a Promise method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(promise)` is not the same as `promise` and it could change the behavior of the code.

DONE.
