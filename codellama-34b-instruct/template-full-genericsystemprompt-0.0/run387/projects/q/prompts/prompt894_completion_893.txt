  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, which would cause the `nfapply()` method to pass the arguments to the callback function in a different order than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.concat(["extra argument"])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat()` method adds an extra argument to the end of the array, which would cause the `nfapply()` method to pass an extra argument to the callback function that it was not expecting.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.filter(function(x) { return x !== "extra argument"; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter()` method removes any elements from the array that do not pass the test implemented by the provided function, which would cause the `nfapply()` method to omit any arguments that are equal to the string
