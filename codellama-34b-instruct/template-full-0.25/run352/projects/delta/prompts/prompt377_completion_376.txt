  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength()` returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, while `peekType()` returns the type of the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekOp()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekOp()` returns the next operation in the iterator, while `peekType()` returns the type of the next operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek()` returns the next operation in the iterator, while `peekType()` returns the type of the next operation.

DONE.
