  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad = (point2.latitude + 180) % 360 - 180;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `deg2rad` function to convert the latitude value to radians, while this replacement code fragment uses a modulo operation to wrap the latitude value to the range -180 to 180, and then subtracts 180. This would result in a different calculation for the `point2Rad` variable, which could potentially cause errors in the `calculateDistance` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad = Math.sin(point2.latitude);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `deg2rad` function to convert the latitude value to radians, while this replacement code fragment uses the `Math.sin` function to calculate the sine of the latitude value. This would result in a different calculation for the `point2Rad` variable, which could
