  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected immediately, rather than being resolved with the value of `promise`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with the value of `promise`, rather than being rejected with the reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.then(promise, function (value) { return value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with the value of `promise`, rather than being rejected with the reason.

DONE.
