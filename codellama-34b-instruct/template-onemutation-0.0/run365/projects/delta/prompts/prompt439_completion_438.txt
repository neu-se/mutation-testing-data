  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `nextOp.retain` is an object and not null, while the new code fragment only checks if `nextOp.retain` is a number. This change would cause the code to behave differently when `nextOp.retain` is an object or null.

DONE.
