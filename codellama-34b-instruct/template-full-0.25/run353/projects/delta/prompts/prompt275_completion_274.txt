  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.peekType()` is a method that returns the type of the next operation in the iterator, while `iter.peekType` is a property that returns the type of the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekType()` is a method that returns the type of the next operation in the other iterator, while `otherIter.peekType` is a property that returns the type of the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.peekType()` is a method that returns the type of the next operation in the delta, while `delta.peekType` is a property that returns the type of the current operation.

DONE.
