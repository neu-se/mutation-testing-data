  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the longitude of the `point` object instead of the `point` object itself, which is what the original code fragment does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the latitude of the `point` object instead of the `point` object itself, which is what the original code fragment does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.longitude + point.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the sum of the longitude and latitude of the `point` object instead of the `point` object itself, which is what the original code fragment does.

DONE.
