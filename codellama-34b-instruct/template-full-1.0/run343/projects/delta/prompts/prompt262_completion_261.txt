  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` property of an op can have different values than the `attributes` property, and the resulting behavior of the mutated method would be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp` is a different object than `thisOp`, and it may have different properties and values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp` is a different object than `thisOp`, and it may have different properties and values.

DONE.
