  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.access(targetBasePath, fs.constants.R_OK | fs.constants.W_OK)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the access mode to read-only, which would cause the code to fail if it tries to write to the target folder.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.access(targetBasePath, fs.constants.R_OK | fs.constants.W_OK | fs.constants.X_OK)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the execute permission to the access mode, which would cause the code to fail if it tries to execute a file in the target folder.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.access(targetBasePath, fs.constants.R_OK | fs.constants.W_OK | fs.constants.X_OK | fs.constants.F_OK
