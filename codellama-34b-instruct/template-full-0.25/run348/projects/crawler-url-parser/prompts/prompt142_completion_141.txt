  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is empty, which would remove the "default." substring from the end of the URL, regardless of the file extension.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '/default'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is "/default", which would add the "default" substring to the end of the URL, regardless of the file extension.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '/default.$1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is "/default.$1", which would add the "default." substring to the end of the URL, followed by the file extension.

DONE.
