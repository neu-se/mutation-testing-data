  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER in the `once` function:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, _value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb, abort, onAbort` calls the `cb` function with the `null` value as the first argument and the ` abort` value as the second argument, while this new code fragment calls the `cb` function with the `_value` variable as both the first and second arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb, abort, onAbort` calls the `cb` function with the `null` value as the first argument and the ` abort` value as the second argument, while this new code fragment calls the `cb` function with the `onAbort` function as the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
