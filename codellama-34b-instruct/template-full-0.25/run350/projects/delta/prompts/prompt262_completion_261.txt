  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` is a different property than `attributes`, and it may not be defined for all operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp` is a different operation than `thisOp`, and it may not have the same attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid value for the `attributes` property, and it may cause errors or unexpected behavior in the code.

DONE.
