  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `c`, which could change the result of the `logHypot` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the value of `c`, which could change the result of the `logHypot` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would halve the value of `c`, which could change the result of the `logHypot` function.

DONE.
