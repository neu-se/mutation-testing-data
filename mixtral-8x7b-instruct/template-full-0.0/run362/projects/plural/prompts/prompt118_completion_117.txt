 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/iCs$/i, function(w) { return w }
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression now has the `C` before the `s`, which would not match the original pattern of words ending in `ics`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/ics$/, function(w) { return w.toUpperCase() + 'S' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function now converts the input word to uppercase and appends an 'S', instead of returning the original word as in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/ix$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression now matches any word ending in 'x', instead of 'ics', and appends 'es' instead of returning the original word.

DONE.
