  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i++])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback function with a boolean value, while this code fragment calls the callback function with the current element of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(array[i++])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback function with a boolean value, while this code fragment calls the callback function with the current element of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(array[i++], null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback function with a boolean value, while this code fragment calls the callback function with the current element of the array and a null value.

DONE.
