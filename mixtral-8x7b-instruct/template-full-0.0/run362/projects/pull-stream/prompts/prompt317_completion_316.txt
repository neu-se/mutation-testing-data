 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it always passes `true` as the error parameter to the callback, even if an error didn't occur.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data, 'extra')
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes an extra argument to the callback, which is not expected by the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(cb, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps the callback in a `setTimeout` call with a delay of 0 milliseconds, which could cause the callback to be executed asynchronously, while the original code calls the callback synchronously.

DONE.
