Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions.customWriteStream ?? zipAFolderOptions.customWriteStream
```
This would result in different behavior because the nullish coalescing operator `??` checks if `zipAFolderOptions.customWriteStream` is nullish and returns its value if it is not. If `zipAFolderOptions.customWriteStream` is nullish, it will return the default value of `zipAFolderOptions.customWriteStream`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions.customWriteStream || zipAFolderOptions.customWriteStream
```
This would result in
