  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deferred.reject(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject()` method would be called even if the `promise.then()` method is successful, which would result in an unnecessary rejection of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deferred.reject(new Error("Exception thrown"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject()` method would be called with a new `Error` object, which would result in a rejection of the promise with a different error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deferred.resolve(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve()` method would be called with the `exception` object, which would result in a fulfillment of the promise with the `exception` object as the value.

DONE.
