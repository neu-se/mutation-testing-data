  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the promise object instead of the resolved value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the resolved value instead of the promise object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.isResolved
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a boolean indicating whether the promise is resolved instead of the resolved value.

DONE.
