  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `terminate(cb)` calls the `terminate` function with the callback `cb`, while this new code fragment simply calls the callback `cb` directly without calling the `terminate` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `terminate(cb)` calls the `terminate` function with the callback `cb`, while this new code fragment simply calls the callback `cb` directly without calling the `terminate` function.

DONE.
