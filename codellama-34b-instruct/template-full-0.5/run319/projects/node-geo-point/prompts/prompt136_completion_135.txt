  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
precision + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `adjust` function would now round the input to the next highest integer instead of the original number of decimal places.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
precision - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `adjust` function would now round the input to the next lowest integer instead of the original number of decimal places.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(precision)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `adjust` function would now round the input to the nearest integer instead of the original number of decimal places.

DONE.
