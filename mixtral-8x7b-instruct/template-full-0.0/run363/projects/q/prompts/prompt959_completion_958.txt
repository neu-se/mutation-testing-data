 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the Array.prototype.slice method instead of the undefined `array_slice` function, which could cause issues if the function was relying on specific behavior of the `array_slice` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a TypeError to be thrown when trying to call the `slice` method on `null`, which would not happen with the original `array_slice` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.prototype.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the Array.prototype.slice method as a property instead of calling the `array_slice` function, which could cause issues if the function was relying on specific behavior of the `array_slice` function.

DONE.
