Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to treat the operation as a delete instead of an insert, potentially leading to incorrect composition of operations and loss of data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'retain' // Incorrectly using 'retain' instead of checking for 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly assume that the next operation is a retain, which could lead to incorrect handling of the operations and unexpected results in the composed delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0 // Using a constant value instead of the dynamic peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always attempt to process the operation with a length of 0, effectively ignoring the actual length of the operation and potentially leading to incorrect composition results.

DONE.
