  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_toString.call
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method is used instead of the `toString` method, which would cause the code to throw a TypeError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_toString.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is used instead of the `toString` method, which would cause the code to throw a TypeError.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_toString.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method is used instead of the `toString` method, which would cause the code to throw a TypeError.

DONE.
