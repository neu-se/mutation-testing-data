  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.search.split("=")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the search string on the first occurrence of "=", while the mutated code fragment splits the search string on every occurrence of "=". This could cause the code to produce different results for URLs with multiple query parameters.

DONE.
