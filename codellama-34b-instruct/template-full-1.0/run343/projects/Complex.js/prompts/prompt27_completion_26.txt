  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'NullPointerException'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw a NullPointerException instead of a SyntaxError, which is the original behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'InvalidArgumentException'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an InvalidArgumentException instead of a SyntaxError, which is the original behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'NotImplementedError'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw a NotImplementedError instead of a SyntaxError, which is the original behavior of the code.

DONE.
