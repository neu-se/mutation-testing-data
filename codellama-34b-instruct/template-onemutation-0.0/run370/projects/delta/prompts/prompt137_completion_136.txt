  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther != null &&
      typeof firstOther.retain === 'string' &&
      firstOther.attributes == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `firstOther.retain` is a number, but the replaced code fragment checks if it is a string. This could cause the code to behave differently if the `retain` property of `firstOther` is not a number.

DONE.
