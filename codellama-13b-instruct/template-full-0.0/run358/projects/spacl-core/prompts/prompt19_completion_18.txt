  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.length > 0 && string.endsWith('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition `string.length > 1` is now `string.length > 0`, which would allow the matcher to match paths with a single character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.length > 1 && !string.endsWith('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition `string.endsWith('/')` is now negated, which would allow the matcher to match paths that do not end with a slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.length > 1 && string.startsWith('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition `string.endsWith('/')` is now `string.startsWith('/')`, which would allow the matcher to match paths that start with a slash.

DONE.
