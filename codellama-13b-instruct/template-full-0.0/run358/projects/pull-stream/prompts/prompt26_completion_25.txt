  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is calling the `pull` function with 4 arguments, while the modified code fragment is calling it with 5 arguments. This could potentially cause the `pull` function to behave differently, depending on how it is implemented.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3], ref[4])
```
