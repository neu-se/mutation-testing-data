  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.delete()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushes the operation onto the `line` delta, while this modified code would delete the operation instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.retain()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushes the operation onto the `line` delta, while this modified code would retain the operation instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.push(otherIter.next(1))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushes the operation onto the `line` delta, while this modified code would push a different operation onto the `line` delta.

DONE.
