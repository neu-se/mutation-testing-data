  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.insert.substring
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring` is a different method than `substr`, and it has a different behavior when the start index is negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.insert.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` is a different method than `substr`, and it has a different behavior when the start index is negative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.insert.substr(0, length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the first `length` characters of the string, regardless of the value of `offset`.

DONE.
