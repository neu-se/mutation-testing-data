  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx` is used to resolve context-dependent paths, while `null` is a constant value that does not have this functionality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a value that is not defined, while `ctx` is a variable that is defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` returns a random number, while `ctx` is a variable that is used to resolve context-dependent paths.

DONE.
