  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[key] = value;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the value to the property of the object instead of pushing it to the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key = value;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the value to the variable `key` instead of pushing it to the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.push(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the value to the array instead of assigning it to the property of the object.

DONE.
