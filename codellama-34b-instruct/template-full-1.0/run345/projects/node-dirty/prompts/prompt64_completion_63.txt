  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `destroy()` method destroys the stream immediately, whereas the `end()` method finishes writing any buffered data before destroying the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end()` method takes an optional `err` parameter, which, if provided, will cause the stream to emit an 'error' event. In this case, the stream would emit an error event with `err` set to a generic Error object, which could potentially cause the stream to be handled differently by the code that consumes it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(undefined, () => console.log('End of stream'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end()` method takes an optional callback function as its second parameter. In this case, the callback function would be
