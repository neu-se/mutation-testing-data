  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rest()` method would start from the next index instead of the current one, potentially returning a different set of operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rest()` method would start from the previous index instead of the current one, potentially returning a different set of operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rest()` method would start from the end of the operations array instead of the current index, potentially returning a different set of operations.

DONE.
