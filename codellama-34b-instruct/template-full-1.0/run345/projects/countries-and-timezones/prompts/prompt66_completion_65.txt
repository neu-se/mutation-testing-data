  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"INVALID"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `options` is truthy, but replacing it with the string "INVALID" would cause the function to always return the string "INVALID" instead of the country object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `+` operator to concatenate `options` with the string "London", but replacing it with the sum of 1 and 2 would cause the function to return the number 3 instead of the country object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `options` is truthy, but replacing it with `null` would cause the function to always return `null` instead of the country object.

DONE.
