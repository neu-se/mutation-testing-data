  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `stream` is a reference to the `stream` variable, which is a function that returns a stream. Replacing it with `null` would cause the code to throw a `TypeError` when trying to call `null` as a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `stream` is a reference to the `stream` variable, which is a function that returns a stream. Replacing it with `undefined` would cause the code to throw a `TypeError` when trying to call `undefined` as a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `stream` is a reference to the `stream` variable, which is a function that returns a stream. Replacing it with an empty object `{}` would cause the code to throw a `Type
