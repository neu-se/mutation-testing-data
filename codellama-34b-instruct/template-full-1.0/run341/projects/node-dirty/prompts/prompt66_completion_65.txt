  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork
```
This would result in different behavior because `cork()` is a method that stops the stream from sending data and lets you write to the buffer without triggering `drain` events, while `destroy()` is a method that permanently destroys the stream and prevents future write operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.resume
```
This would result in different behavior because `resume()` is a method that resumes the flow of data in a paused stream, while `destroy()` is a method that permanently destroys the stream and prevents future write operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end
```
This would result in different behavior because `end()` is a method that signals the end of the data that can be sent through the stream, while `destroy()` is a method that permanently destroys the stream and prevents future write operations.

DONE.
