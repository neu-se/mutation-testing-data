 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / a
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the sign of the result when `a` is negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the sign of `a` from the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
a * a
```
This would result in different behavior because it squares the value of `a`, which would change the result for negative values of `a`.

DONE.
