  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'delete' &&
        thisIter.peekLength() <= firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for an insert operation, while this replacement checks for a delete operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' &&
        thisIter.peekLength() >= firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for an insert operation with a length less than or equal to firstLeft, while this replacement checks for an insert operation with a length greater than or equal to firstLeft.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' &&
        thisIter.peekLength() === firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for an insert operation with a length less than or equal to firstLeft, while this replacement checks for an insert operation with a length equal to first
