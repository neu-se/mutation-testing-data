  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is used to call a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided individually, whereas `apply` is used to call a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided as an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function that, when called, will call the original function with a given `this` value and arguments provided individually, whereas `apply` calls the function immediately with the given `this` value and arguments provided as an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(null, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the function with a `this` value of `null` and the arguments provided in the `args` array, whereas the original code uses the `this` value of the `callback` function and the arguments provided in the `args`
