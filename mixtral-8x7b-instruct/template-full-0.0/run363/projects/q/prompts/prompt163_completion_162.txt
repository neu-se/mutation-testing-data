 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\n<script>alert('Mutated code!');</script>\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because it injects a script tag that displays an alert, which is not present in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\n\t\t"
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an extra tabulation, changing the indentation of the following line, which might cause issues in some specific parsers or code linters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\n</body>"
```
This would result in different behavior because it prematurely closes the body tag, potentially causing rendering issues or breaking the structure of the HTML document.

DONE.
