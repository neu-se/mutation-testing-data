  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method is used to invoke the `task` function, which would cause the function to be executed in the global scope, rather than in the scope of the `nextTick` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task.apply()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is used to invoke the `task` function, which would cause the function to be executed in the global scope, rather than in the scope of the `nextTick` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task.bind()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method is used to create a new function that is bound to the `task` function, but it is not invoked. This would cause the `task` function to be executed in the global scope, rather than in the scope of the `nextTick` function.

DONE.
