  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin` and `cos` are inverse trigonometric functions, and the calculation of `sinφ2` would be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `tan` and `cos` are inverse trigonometric functions, and the calculation of `sinφ2` would be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `acos` and `cos` are inverse trigonometric functions, and the calculation of `sinφ2` would be incorrect.

DONE.
