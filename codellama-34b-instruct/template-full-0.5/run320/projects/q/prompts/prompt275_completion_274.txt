  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.reject("error")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the error message "error", which would trigger the promise's rejection handler.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.resolve("success")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the value "success", which would trigger the promise's resolution handler.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.reject(new Error("error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with an Error object containing the message "error", which would trigger the promise's rejection handler.

DONE.
