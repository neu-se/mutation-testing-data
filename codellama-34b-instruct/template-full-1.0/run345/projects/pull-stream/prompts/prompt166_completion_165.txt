  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a reference to the callback function that is passed as an argument to the `values` function. Replacing it with `null` would cause the `abortCb` function to be called with `null` as the first argument, rather than the callback function. As a result, the `abortCb` function would not be able to call the callback function, and the behavior of the code would be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a reference to the callback function that is passed as an argument to the `values` function. Replacing it with `undefined` would cause the `abortCb` function to be called with `undefined` as the first argument, rather than the callback function. As a result, the `abortCb` function would not be able to call the callback function, and the behavior of the code would be different
