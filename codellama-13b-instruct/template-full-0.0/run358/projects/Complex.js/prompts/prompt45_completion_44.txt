  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator returns a string representing the type of the operand, while the `toString()` method returns a string representing the value of the operand.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.constructor.name
```
This would result in different behavior because the `constructor` property returns a reference to the constructor function that created the object, while the `name` property returns a string representing the name of the constructor function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because the `prototype` property returns a reference to the prototype of the object, while the `typeof` operator returns a string representing the type of the operand.

DONE.
