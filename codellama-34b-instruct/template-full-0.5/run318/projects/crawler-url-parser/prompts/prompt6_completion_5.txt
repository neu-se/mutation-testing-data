  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `test()` method to check if the string contains any illegal characters, but the replaced code fragment uses the `toLowerCase()` method, which would convert the string to lowercase but would not check for illegal characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `test()` method to check if the string contains any illegal characters, but the replaced code fragment uses the `split()` method, which would split the string into an array of individual characters, but would not check for illegal characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/\W/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `test()` method to check if the string contains any illegal characters, but the replaced code fragment uses the `replace()` method with
