  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `Math.log(_b)` when `a` is equal to `b`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `Math.log(_b)` when `a` is greater than `b`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `Math.log(_b)` when `a` is less than `b`, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
