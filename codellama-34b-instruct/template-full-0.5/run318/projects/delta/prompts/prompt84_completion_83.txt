  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<` operator is used for comparison, and it would always return `false` if the operands are not of the same type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!==
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator is used for comparison, and it would always return `true` if the operands are not of the same type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
==
```
This would result in different behavior because the `==` operator is used for comparison, and it would always return `true` if the operands are of the same type.

DONE.
