 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
typeof handler === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for `undefined` instead of the existence of the `handler` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
handler === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for `null` explicitly, which might not cover cases where the handler is `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.keys(this.handlers).includes(embedType) === false
