  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a `0` instead of calling the `parser_exit` function, which would cause the code to continue executing instead of exiting.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a `1` instead of calling the `parser_exit` function, which would cause the code to return a `1` instead of exiting.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a `false` instead of calling the `parser_exit` function, which would cause the code to continue executing instead of exiting.

DONE.
