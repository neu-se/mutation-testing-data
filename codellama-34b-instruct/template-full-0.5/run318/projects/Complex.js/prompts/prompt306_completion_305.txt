  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b` variable is incremented by 1, which changes the value of the `sinh` function and the resulting complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b` variable is negated, which changes the sign of the `sinh` function and the resulting complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b` variable is multiplied by 2, which changes the value of the `sinh` function and the resulting complex number.

DONE.
