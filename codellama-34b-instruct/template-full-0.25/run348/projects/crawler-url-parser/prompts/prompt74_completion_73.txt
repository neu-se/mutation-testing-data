  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attr` method would return the value of the `href` attribute of the `base` element, which may not be the same as the `href` attribute of the `a` element being processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('a').attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attr` method would return the value of the `href` attribute of the `a` element being processed, which may not be the same as the `href` attribute of the `base` element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').attr('href') || $('a').attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would return the value of the `href` attribute of the `base` element if it exists, or the value of the `href` attribute of the `a` element if the `
