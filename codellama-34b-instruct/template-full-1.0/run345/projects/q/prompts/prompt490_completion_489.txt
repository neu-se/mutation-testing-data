  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return true, causing the rejection to be ignored.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return false, causing the rejection to be handled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (promise.isRejected())
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would check the state of the promise, causing the rejection to be handled if the promise is rejected.

DONE.
