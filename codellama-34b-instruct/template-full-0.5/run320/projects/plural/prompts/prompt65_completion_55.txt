  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacterium', 'bacteriaa'
```
This would result in different behavior because the second word is different, so the test would fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacterium', 'bacteria' + 'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the second word is constructed differently, so the test would fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacterium', 'bacteria' * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the second word is constructed differently, so the test would fail.

DONE.
