```
for (const verb in verbs) {
  this.verbs[verb] = false;
}

This would result in different behavior because it would deny all verbs, regardless of whether they were previously allowed or denied.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const verb of Object.keys(verbs)) {
  this.verbs[verb] = false;
}

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const verb of Object.values(verbs)) {
  this.verbs[verb] = false;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only deny verbs that are explicitly listed in the `verbs` object, while the original code would deny all verbs that are
