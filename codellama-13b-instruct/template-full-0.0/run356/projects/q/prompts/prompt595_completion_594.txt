  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the `args` array, rather than the array itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first element of the `args` array, rather than the array itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new array containing all but the first element of the `args` array, rather than the array itself.

DONE.
