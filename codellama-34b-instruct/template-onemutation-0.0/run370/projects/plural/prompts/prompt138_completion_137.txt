  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule[0]` is a regular expression, and `rule[1]` is a string or a function. Using `rule[0]` instead of `rule[1]` would cause the regular expression to be applied to the word, which would result in a different plural form.

DONE.
