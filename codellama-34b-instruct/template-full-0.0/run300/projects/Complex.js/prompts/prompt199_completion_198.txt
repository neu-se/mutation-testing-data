  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` returns the square root of a number, while `Math.pow` returns the value of a number raised to a power.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number, while `Math.pow` returns the value of a number raised to a power.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log` returns the natural logarithm of a number, while `Math.pow` returns the value of a number raised to a power.

DONE.
