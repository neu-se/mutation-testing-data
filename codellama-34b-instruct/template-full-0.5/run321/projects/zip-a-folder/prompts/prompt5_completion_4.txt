  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream || targetFilePath
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the `customWriteStream` if it is defined, even if `targetFilePath` is also defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream && targetFilePath
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the `targetFilePath` if `customWriteStream` is not defined, even if `customWriteStream` is defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream && targetFilePath
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the `targetFilePath` if `customWriteStream` is defined, even if `targetFilePath` is not defined.

DONE.
