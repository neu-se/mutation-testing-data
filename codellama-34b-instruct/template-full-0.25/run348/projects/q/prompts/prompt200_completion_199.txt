  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.split
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method is not defined for the `stack` property of an Error object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString` method is not defined for the `stack` property of an Error object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method is not defined for the `stack` property of an Error object.

DONE.
