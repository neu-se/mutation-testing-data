  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, nodeback]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeback` argument is now included in the array passed to the `post` method. This would cause the `nodeback` function to be called with the result of the `post` method, rather than the `nodeback` function being called with the result of the `post` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, nodeback, "post"]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method is now called with the `nodeback` function as the last argument. This would cause the `nodeback` function to be called with the result of the `post` method, rather than the `nodeback` function being called with the result of the `post` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, nodeback, "post", "post"]
```
This would result in different behavior because the
