  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `x` is an integer, while `x + 1` is a non-integer. This could cause the `cosm1` function to return a different value, potentially leading to a different outcome in the `hypot` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `x` is an integer, while `x * 2` is a non-integer. This could cause the `cosm1` function to return a different value, potentially leading to a different outcome in the `hypot` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `x` is an integer, while `x / 2` is a non-integer. This could cause the `cosm1` function to return a different value
