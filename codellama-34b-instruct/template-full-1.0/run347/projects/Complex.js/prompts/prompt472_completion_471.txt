  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` checks for NaN values, and using `!isNaN` would negate the result, causing the function to return `true` for NaN values and `false` for all other values, including infinities and real numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['re'] === NaN)
```
This would result in different behavior because `if (this['re'] === NaN)` checks for NaN values in the real part `re` of the complex number, and would return `true` for NaN values, but `false` for Infinities and real numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['re'] > NaN)
```
This would result in different behavior because `if (this['re'] > NaN)` checks for real numbers that are greater than NaN, which is always `false`, and would cause the function to return `false` for all values, including infinities
