  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > len
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never be entered, as the condition `i > len` is always false for `i = 0` and `len` is a positive integer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= len
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would be entered an additional time, as the condition `i <= len` is true for `i = len` and `len` is a positive integer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i >= len
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would be entered an additional time, as the condition `i >= len` is true for `i = len` and `len` is a positive integer.

DONE.
