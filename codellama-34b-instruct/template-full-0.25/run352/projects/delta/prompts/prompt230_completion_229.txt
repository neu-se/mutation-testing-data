  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` variable is used to determine the length of a string, and adding 1 to it would cause the string to be one character longer than it should be.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` variable is used to determine the length of a string, and subtracting 1 from it would cause the string to be one character shorter than it should be.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` variable is used to determine the length of a string, and multiplying it by 2 would cause the string to be twice as long as it should be.

DONE.
