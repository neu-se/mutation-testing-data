 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for both `null` and `undefined`, whereas the original code only checks for `undefined`. This could cause false negatives if a property exists but has a value of `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match[index + 1] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if the next character in the match is not `undefined`, rather than checking if it matches the property value. This could cause false positives if the next character in the match is not `undefined` but also does not match the property value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match[index + 1] !== ctx[this.regex.props[index]]
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the next character in the match is not equal to the corresponding property value in the context, rather than checking if the entire property path matches. This could cause false
