  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper !== mapper
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `mapper` is falsy, whereas this new code fragment checks if `mapper` is equal to itself, which is always true if `mapper` is not `null` or `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!mapper.call
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `mapper` is falsy, whereas this new code fragment checks if `mapper.call` is falsy, which could result in different behavior if `mapper` is not a function or has no `call` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!mapper(42)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `mapper` is falsy, whereas this new code fragment calls the `mapper` function with the argument `42` and checks if the returned value is f
