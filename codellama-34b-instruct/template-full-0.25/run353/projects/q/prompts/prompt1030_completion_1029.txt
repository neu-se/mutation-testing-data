  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid value for the `nodeback` function, which expects a function as its second argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid value for the `nodeback` function, which expects a function as its second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeback` function expects a function as its second argument, and `function() {}` is not the same function as the one that was passed to `nodeify`.

DONE.
