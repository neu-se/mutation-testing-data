  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isFinite` checks if a value is a finite number, whereas `Number.isInteger` checks if a value is an integer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isNaN` checks if a value is NaN (Not a Number), whereas `Number.isInteger` checks if a value is an integer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isSafeInteger
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isSafeInteger` checks if a value is a safe integer, whereas `Number.isInteger` checks if a value is an integer.

DONE.
