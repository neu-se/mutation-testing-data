  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.length
```
This change will cause the `matches` method to always return `false` if the `ctx` argument is an empty string, which may cause the `query` method to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.substring(1)
```
This change will cause the `matches` method to always return `false` if the `ctx` argument is a string that starts with a space character, which may cause the `query` method to return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.toLowerCase()
```
This change will cause the `matches` method to always return `false` if the `ctx` argument is a string that contains any uppercase letters, which may cause the `query` method to return incorrect results.

DONE.
