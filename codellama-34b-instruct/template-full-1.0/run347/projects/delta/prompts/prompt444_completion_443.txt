  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset + length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method takes a single integer as an argument, not a range of indices. This change would result in the `next` method returning the wrong substring.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset * length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method takes a single integer as an argument, not a product of two integers. This change would result in the `next` method returning the wrong substring.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset - length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method takes a single integer as an argument, not a difference of two integers. This change would result in the `next` method returning the wrong substring.

DONE.
