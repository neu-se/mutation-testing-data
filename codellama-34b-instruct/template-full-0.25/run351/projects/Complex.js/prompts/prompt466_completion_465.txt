  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, whereas the original code used the `===` operator to check for strict equality. This means that the new code would return `true` if `b` is not equal to `0`, whereas the original code would return `true` if `b` is equal to `0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `>` operator checks for greater than, whereas the original code used the `===` operator to check for equality. This means that the new code would return `true` if `b` is greater than `0`, whereas the original code would return `true` if `b` is equal to `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<` operator checks for less than, whereas the original code used the `==
