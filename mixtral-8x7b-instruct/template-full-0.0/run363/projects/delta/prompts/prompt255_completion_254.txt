 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the current operation in the `this` Delta instead of the `other` Delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use a length of 0 for the `other` operation, potentially causing the loop to exit early or causing unexpected behavior in the `retain` or `push` calls.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek().length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the current operation in the `this` Delta instead of the length of the `other` operation. This could cause the loop to exit early or cause unexpected behavior in the `retain` or `push` calls.

DONE.
