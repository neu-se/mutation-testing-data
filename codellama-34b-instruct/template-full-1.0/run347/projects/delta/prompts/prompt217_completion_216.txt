  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is slicing the `ops` property of the `other` object, which is an array, while the new code fragment is replacing the `ops` property itself, which could have different values or references.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is slicing the `ops` property of the `other` object, which is an array, while the new code fragment is replacing the `ops` property with null, which could lead to unexpected behavior when trying to access the `ops` property or when comparing the value of `other` to other objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.name
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is slicing the `ops` property of the `other` object, which is an array, while the new code fragment is replacing the `ops` property with the
