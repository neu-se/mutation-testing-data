  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType(<PLACEHOLDER>) === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekType` method is not defined in the `OpIterator` class, and the `peek` method should be used instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekType` method is not defined in the `OpIterator` class, and the `peek` method should be used instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekType` method is not defined in the `OpIterator` class, and the `peek` method should be used instead.

DONE.
