  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"head"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get()` method would always return the same value, instead of the next value in the queue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"tail" + "tail"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get()` method would return the concatenation of the `tail` property and the string "tail", instead of the next value in the queue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"tail".toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get()` method would return the uppercase version of the `tail` property, instead of the next value in the queue.

DONE.
