  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r + a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add `a` to `r`, regardless of whether `a` is positive or negative. In the original code, `a` is only added to `r` if it is positive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r - a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always subtract `a` from `r`, regardless of whether `a` is positive or negative. In the original code, `a` is only subtracted from `r` if it is negative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r * a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always multiply `r` by `a`, regardless of whether `a` is positive or negative. In the original code, `a` is only multiplied by `r` if it is positive.

DONE.
