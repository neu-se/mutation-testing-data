  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the array would always be 0, regardless of whether there are any unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the array would always be 0, regardless of whether there are any unhandled rejections that have been reported.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
untrackedRejections.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the array would always be 0, regardless of whether there are any untracked rejections.

DONE.
