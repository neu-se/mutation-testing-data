 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it specifically checks for the `null` value, whereas the original code checks for falsy values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(country).length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `country` object is empty, rather than just checking if the `country` variable is defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof country === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `country` is of the `undefined` type, rather than checking if it is falsy.

Note: These changes are meant to introduce differences in behavior to test the effectiveness of the test suite. They might not necessarily represent "buggy" code in a real-world scenario.

DONE.
