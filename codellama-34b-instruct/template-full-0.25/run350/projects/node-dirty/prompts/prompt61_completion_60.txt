  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.destroy()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not call the `destroy()` method, which would cause the read stream to be destroyed immediately, potentially resulting in data loss or corruption.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.close()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not call the `close()` method, which would cause the read stream to remain open, potentially resulting in data loss or corruption.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not call the `end()` method, which would cause the read stream to remain open, potentially resulting in data loss or corruption.

DONE.
