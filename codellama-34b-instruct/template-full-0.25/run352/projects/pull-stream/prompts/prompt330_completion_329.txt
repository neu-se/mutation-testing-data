  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the data being passed through the stream, while `null` is a null value. Using `null` would cause the stream to pass through null values instead of the original data, which could cause issues if the downstream code is not expecting null values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the data being passed through the stream, while `undefined` is a value that indicates the absence of a value. Using `undefined` would cause the stream to pass through undefined values instead of the original data, which could cause issues if the downstream code is not expecting undefined values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the data being passed through the stream, while `0` is a number value.
