  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `file` variable, which is a string, while the new code fragment is using the `null` value, which is not a string. This could cause the `fs.writeFileSync` method to throw an error or produce unexpected results.

DONE.
