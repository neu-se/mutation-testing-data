  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, and it would not have the same methods and properties as a `Promise` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value, and it would not have the same methods and properties as a `Promise` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"foo"` is a string, and it would not have the same methods and properties as a `Promise` object.

DONE.
