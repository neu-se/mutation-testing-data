  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!seen[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the result of the `seen[key]` expression, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` regardless of the value of `seen[key]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
seen[key] === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator would check for strict equality between `seen[key]` and `true`, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false` regardless of the value of `seen[key]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
seen[key] !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator would check for strict inequality between `seen[key]` and `true`, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` regardless of the value of `seen[key]`.

DONE.
