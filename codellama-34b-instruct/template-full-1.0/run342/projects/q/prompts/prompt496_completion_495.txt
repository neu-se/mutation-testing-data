  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejected` is not a promise, so it would not have a `when` method and would immediately reject the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately reject the promise with the `reason` argument, rather than waiting for the promise to be resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Promise(() => { throw reason; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that throws an exception immediately, rather than waiting for the promise to be resolved.

DONE.
