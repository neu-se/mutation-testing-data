  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.prototype.npost` would attempt to call the function with a different context, potentially leading to an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would attempt to call `null` with the provided arguments, potentially leading to an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind()` would create a new function with a different context, potentially leading to an error.

DONE.
