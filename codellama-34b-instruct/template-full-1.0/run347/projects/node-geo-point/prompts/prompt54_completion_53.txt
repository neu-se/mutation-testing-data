  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(Δλ) * tan(φ1 * φ2);
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the product between `sin(Δλ)` and the tangent of the product between `φ1` and `φ2`, whereas the original code used the cosine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ1) * sin(φ2) - sin(φ1) * cos(φ2);
```
This would result in different behavior because it rearranges the order of the operations compared to the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 Math.acos(cos(φ1) * sin(φ2) - sin(φ1) * cos(φ2));
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the inverse cosine function from the Math library, whereas the original code used the arccosine function.

DONE.
