  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(point2.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `deg2rad(point2.latitude)` converts the latitude value from degrees to radians, while `Math.cos(point2.latitude)` returns the cosine of the latitude value. This change would affect the calculation of the bearing between two points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(point2.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `deg2rad(point2.latitude)` converts the latitude value from degrees to radians, while `Math.sin(point2.latitude)` returns the sine of the latitude value. This change would affect the calculation of the bearing between two points.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan(point2.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `deg2rad(point2.lat
