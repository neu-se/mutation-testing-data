  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = verbs[verb]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the value of the `verbs` object property with the key `verb` to the `verb` variable, instead of using the `verb` variable as a key to access the `verbs` object property.
