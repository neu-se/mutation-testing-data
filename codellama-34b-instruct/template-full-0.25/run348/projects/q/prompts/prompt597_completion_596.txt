  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("get", [key])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a promise for the property value, rather than a promise for the result of the operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("set", [key, value])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a promise for the return value, rather than a promise for the result of the operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("delete", [key])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a promise for the return value, rather than a promise for the result of the operation.

DONE.
