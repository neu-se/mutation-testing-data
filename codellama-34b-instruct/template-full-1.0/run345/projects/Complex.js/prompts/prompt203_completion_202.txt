  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + (a * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `1 + (a * b)` is not the same as `a * b` in the context of the surrounding code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + (b * c)
```
This would result in different behavior because `a + (b * c)` is not the same as `a * b` in the context of the surrounding code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a + b) * c
```
This would result in different behavior because `(a + b) * c` is not the same as `a * b` in the context of the surrounding code.

DONE.
