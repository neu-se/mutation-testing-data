  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is performing a single multiplication operation, whereas the modified code fragment is performing a multiplication of `b` by 2, which changes the resulting value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is performing a single addition operation, whereas the modified code fragment is performing an addition of 1 to `b`, which changes the resulting value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is performing a single multiplication operation, whereas the modified code fragment is performing a multiplication by 2 of the sine of `b`, which changes the resulting value.

DONE.
