  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value and does not have a `progressed` property, unlike `void 0`, which is a function that returns `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, undefined, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value and does not have a `progressed` property, unlike `void 0`, which is a function that returns `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, void 0, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a function that returns `undefined`, and `undefined` does not have a `progressed` property.

DONE.
