  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the Boolean value of `rejected`, so the `untrackRejection` function would be called even if the promise is fulfilled, which would cause the `unhandledRejections` array to grow indefinitely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than the `!` operator, so `rejected` will be first be coerced to a Boolean value, and then the result will be negated. This would cause the `untrackRejection` function to be called only if `rejected` is `false`, which would cause the `unhandledRejections` array to grow indefinitely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected || false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has
