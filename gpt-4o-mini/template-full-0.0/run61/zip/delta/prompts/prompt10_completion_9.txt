Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to check for keys in `b` instead of `a`, potentially overwriting attributes from `b` instead of preserving those from `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the keys of `b` instead of `a`, leading to the addition of attributes from `b` to `attributes` even when they are not defined in `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(a).filter(key => a[key] === undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider keys in `a` that are `undefined`, effectively ignoring any defined keys in `a` and potentially omitting important attributes from the final result.

DONE.
