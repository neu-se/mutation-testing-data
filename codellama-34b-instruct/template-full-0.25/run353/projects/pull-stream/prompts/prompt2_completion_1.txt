  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinks
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinks` object is not the same as the `sources` object, and the `pull` function may not handle the `sinks` object correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throughs
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throughs` object is not the same as the `sources` object, and the `pull` function may not handle the `throughs` object correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pull` function may not handle a `null` value correctly.

DONE.
