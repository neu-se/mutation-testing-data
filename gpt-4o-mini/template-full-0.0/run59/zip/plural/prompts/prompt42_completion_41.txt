Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because changing the starting index from `0` to `1` would cause the function to skip the first character of the word when forming the plural, leading to incorrect pluralization for words like "index".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-2
```
This would result in different behavior because using `-2` as the starting index would cause the function to incorrectly remove the last two characters of the word instead of the last two characters before appending "ices", which would lead to incorrect plural forms for words like "index".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 3
```
This would result in different behavior because changing the starting index to `w.length - 3` would remove the last three characters of the word instead of the last two, which would produce incorrect plural forms for words like "appendix".

DONE.
