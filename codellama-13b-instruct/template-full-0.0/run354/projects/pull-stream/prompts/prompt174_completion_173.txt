  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array.length` property is a number, while the original code fragment `array` is an array. This would cause the `values` function to return a function that always returns `true` when called, regardless of the `abort` parameter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array[0]` property is the first element of the array, while the original code fragment `array` is the entire array. This would cause the `values` function to return a function that always returns the first element of the array when called, regardless of the `abort` parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array.slice(0, 1)` method returns a new array containing the first element of the original array, while the original code fragment `
