  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the `ops` array, which is not the same as the original code which returns the `ops` array itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.ops[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first element of the `ops` array, which is not the same as the original code which returns the entire `ops` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.ops.map(op => op.retain)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of only the `retain` properties of the `op` objects in the `ops` array, which is not the same as the original code which returns an array of `op` objects.

DONE.
