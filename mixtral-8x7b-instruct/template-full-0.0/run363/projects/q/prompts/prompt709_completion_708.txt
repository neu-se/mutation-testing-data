 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is replaced with an empty array, causing `array_slice` to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function expects an array-like object, and null is not one. This would cause `array_slice` to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
123
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function expects an array-like object, and a number is not one. This would cause `array_slice` to throw an error.

By introducing these changes, we can find weaknesses in the test suite by observing if any tests fail due to the different behavior introduced by the mutations. DONE.
