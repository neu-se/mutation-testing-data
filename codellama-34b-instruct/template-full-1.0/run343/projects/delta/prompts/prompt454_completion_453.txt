  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `next()` method to return a different result when `this.offset` is greater than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `next()` method to return a different result when `this.offset` is not equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `next()` method to return a different result when `this.offset` is greater than or equal to 0.

DONE.
