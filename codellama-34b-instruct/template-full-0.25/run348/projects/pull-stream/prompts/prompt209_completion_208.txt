  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `aborted` is truthy, while this new code fragment checks if `aborted` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted && err
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `aborted` is truthy, while this new code fragment checks if both `aborted` and `err` are truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err || aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `aborted` is truthy, while this new code fragment checks if either `err` or `aborted` are truthy.

DONE.
