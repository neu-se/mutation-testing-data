  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength() < Infinity;
```
This would result in different behavior because the previous code fragment used `<` instead of `<=` to check for infinity.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength() <= Infinity;
```
This would result in different behavior because the previous code fragment used `<` instead of `<=` to check for infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength() !== Infinity;
```
This would result in different behavior because the previous code fragment used `<` instead of `!==` to check for infinity.

DONE.
