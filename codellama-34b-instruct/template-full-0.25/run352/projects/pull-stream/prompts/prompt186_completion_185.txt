  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` calls the callback function with the value `true`, while the new code fragment `cb(false)` calls the callback function with the value `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` calls the callback function with the value `true`, while the new code fragment `cb(null)` calls the callback function with the value `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(array[i++])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` calls the callback function with the value `true`, while the new code fragment `cb(array[i++])` calls the callback function with the value `array[i++]`, which is the next element in the `array` variable.

DONE.
