  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(value).thenResolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fcall` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments, but it does not return a promise, so the `thenResolve` method would not be called on the returned value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(value).then(function (result) { return result; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `fcall` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments, but it does not return a promise, so the `then` method would not be called on the returned value.
