  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh(a) * sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cosh(a) * Math.sin(b)` would return the negative of the expected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / sinh(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cosh(a) * Math.sin(b)` would return a complex number with a positive real part, while `1 / sinh(a)` would return a complex number with a negative real part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tanh(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cosh(a) * Math.sin(b)` would return a complex number with a non-zero imaginary part, while `Math.tanh(a)` would return a complex number with a zero imaginary part.

DONE.
