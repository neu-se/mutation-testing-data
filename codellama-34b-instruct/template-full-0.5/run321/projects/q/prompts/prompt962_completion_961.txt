  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now refer to the second argument instead of the first.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now refer to the third argument instead of the first.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now refer to the argument with the key "foo" instead of the first argument.

DONE.
