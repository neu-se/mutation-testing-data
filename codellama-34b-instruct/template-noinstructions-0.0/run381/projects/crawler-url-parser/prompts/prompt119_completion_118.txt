  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gettype` function would return "external" instead of "internal" when the `linkurl` and `pageurl` have the same host.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gettype` function would return "internal" instead of "external" when the `linkurl` and `pageurl` have different hosts.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"http://example.com"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gettype` function would return "external" instead of "internal" when the `linkurl` and `pageurl` have the same host, and the `linkurl` is not a subdomain of the `pageurl`.

DONE.
