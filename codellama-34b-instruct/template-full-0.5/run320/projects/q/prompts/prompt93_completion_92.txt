  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute, as the condition `index < length` would never be true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only execute once, as the condition `index < length` would be false on the second iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute an additional time, as the condition `index < length` would be true on the second iteration.

DONE.
