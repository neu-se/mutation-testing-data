  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(reject(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the given value, whereas the original code fragment would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the given value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(fulfill(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the given value, whereas the original code fragment would cause the promise to be rejected with the given value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(Q(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the given value, whereas the original code fragment would cause the promise to be rejected with the given value.

DONE.
