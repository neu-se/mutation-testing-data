  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memo'
```
This would result in different behavior because it will always return the singular form of the word, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' Memory'
```
This would result in different behavior because it will always return the plural form of the word, regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'Memories'
```
This would result in different behavior because it will always return the plural form of the word, and it would not match the input if it was a single 'memory'.

DONE.
