 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns a distance of 0, regardless of the input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
r + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns a distance greater than or equal to 1, even if the input values would result in a smaller distance.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
