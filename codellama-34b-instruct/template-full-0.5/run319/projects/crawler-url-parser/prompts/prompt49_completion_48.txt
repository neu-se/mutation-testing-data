  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve(parsedBaseUrl, parsedUrl.href)
```
This would result in different behavior because `parsedUrl.href` includes the query string and hash, whereas `parsedUrl` does not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve(parsedBaseUrl, parsedUrl.path)
```
This would result in different behavior because `parsedUrl.path` only includes the path portion of the URL, whereas `parsedUrl` includes the protocol, host, and query string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve(parsedBaseUrl, parsedUrl.pathname)
```
This would result in different behavior because `parsedUrl.pathname` only includes the path portion of the URL, whereas `parsedUrl` includes the protocol, host, and query string.

DONE.
