  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because [] is an empty array, rather than nodeArgs, which is an array of arguments passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[nodeArgs, "foo"]
```
This would result in different behavior because nodeArgs is an array of arguments passed to the function, but by concatenating it with the string "foo", we are creating a new array with the contents of nodeArgs and the string "foo". This would likely cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[nodeArgs, nodeArgs.length]
```
This would result in different behavior because by including nodeArgs.length in the array, we are effectively including the length of the nodeArgs array as an argument to the function. This would likely cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
