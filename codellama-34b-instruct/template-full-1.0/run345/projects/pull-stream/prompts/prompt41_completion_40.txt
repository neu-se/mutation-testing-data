  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `pull.call` is a different way of calling a function than `pull.apply`, and it may result in a different set of arguments being passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `pull.bind` creates a new function that, when called, will call the original `pull` function with a pre-set `this` value and any arguments passed to the bound function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull.spread
```
This would result in different behavior because `pull.spread` is a different way of calling a function than `pull.apply`, and it may result in a different set of arguments being passed to the function.

DONE.
