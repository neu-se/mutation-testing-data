  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[next].concat(this.rest())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `next` element with the result of the `rest()` method, which is not the same as concatenating `next` with the `ops` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[next].concat(this.ops.slice(this.index))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate `next` with a slice of the `ops` array starting from the current index, which is not the same as concatenating `next` with the entire `ops` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[next].concat(this.ops.slice(this.index + 1))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate `next` with a slice of the `ops` array starting from the next index, which is not the same as concatenating `next` with the entire `ops` array.
