Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly checks the type of the current operation in `thisIter` instead of `otherIter`, potentially leading to incorrect transformations when the two Deltas are merged.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() > 0 ? 'insert' : 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the condition to always evaluate to 'insert' if there are any operations in `otherIter`, which could lead to incorrect handling of operations that should be treated as deletes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the logic to treat a delete operation in `otherIter` as a priority over an insert, which could lead to unexpected results when merging operations from the two Deltas.

DONE.
