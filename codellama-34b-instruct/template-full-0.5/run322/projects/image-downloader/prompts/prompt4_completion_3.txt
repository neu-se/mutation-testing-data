  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `options.dest` is falsy, while this replacement checks if it is exactly `null`. If `options.dest` is `undefined`, the original code would still execute the `if` block, but this replacement would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `options.dest` is falsy, while this replacement checks if it is an empty string. If `options.dest` is a non-empty string, the original code would still execute the `if` block, but this replacement would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.startsWith('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `options.dest` is falsy, while this replacement checks if it starts with a forward slash
