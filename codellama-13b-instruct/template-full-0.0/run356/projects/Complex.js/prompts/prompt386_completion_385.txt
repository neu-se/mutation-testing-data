  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `acosh` function would return a complex number with a real part of `log(c + sqrt(c^2 - 1))` instead of `log(c + sqrt(c^2 + 1))`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `acosh` function would return a complex number with a real part of `log(c + sqrt(c^2 - 1))` instead of `log(c + sqrt(c^2 + 1))`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `acosh` function would return a complex number with a real part of `log(c + sqrt(c^2 - 1))` instead of `log(c + sqrt(c^2 + 1))`.

DONE.
