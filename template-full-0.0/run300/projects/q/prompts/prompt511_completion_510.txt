  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp, args.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.slice()` creates a shallow copy of the `args` array, which may not be the desired behavior in the context of the `apply` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp, args.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.concat()` creates a new array that is the concatenation of the `args` array and any additional arguments passed to the `concat` method, which may not be the desired behavior in the context of the `apply` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp, args.map(function(arg) { return arg + 1; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.map()` creates a new array where each element is the result of calling the provided function on the corresponding element of the original array, which may not be the desired behavior in the context of the `apply` method
