  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 ** zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the number of tiles in a row at a given zoom level, while the replaced code calculates the total number of tiles in the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (zoom + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the number of tiles in a row at a given zoom level, while the replaced code calculates the number of tiles in a row at the next zoom level.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 / zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the number of tiles in a row at a given zoom level, while the replaced code calculates the number of tiles in a column at the same zoom level.

DONE.
