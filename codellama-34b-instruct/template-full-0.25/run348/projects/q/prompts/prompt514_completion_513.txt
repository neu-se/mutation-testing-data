  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred` is not a function, and would cause a `TypeError` when invoked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer()` is not a function, and would cause a `TypeError` when invoked.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` is a function that creates a new deferred object, which would cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
