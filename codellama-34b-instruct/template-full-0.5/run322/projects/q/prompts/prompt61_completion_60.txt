  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value and does not have a `toString` method, so the comparison would fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value and does not have a `toString` method, so the comparison would fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ toString: function() { return "object"; } }
```
This would result in different behavior because the object has a `toString` method that returns a string, so the comparison would succeed.

DONE.
