  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/g, function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag is added to the regular expression, which makes it match all occurrences of "ics" in the word, instead of just the last one. This would cause words like "statistics" to be pluralized as "statisticeses" instead of "statistics".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag is added to the regular expression, which makes it case-insensitive. This would cause words like "Mathematics" to be pluralized as "Mathematics" instead of "Mathematicses".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/g, function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in
