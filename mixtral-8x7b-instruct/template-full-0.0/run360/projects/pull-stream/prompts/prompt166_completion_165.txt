 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { cb(true) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment directly passes `cb` as the argument, while the modified fragment wraps `cb` with an anonymous function. This could cause issues if the test suite relies on the context (`this`) of the callback function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes `cb` as the argument, while the modified fragment passes `null`. This could cause issues if the test suite relies on the callback function being called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => cb(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes `cb` as the argument, while the modified fragment passes an arrow function that wraps `cb`. This could cause issues if the test suite relies on the context (`this`) of the callback function.

DONE.
