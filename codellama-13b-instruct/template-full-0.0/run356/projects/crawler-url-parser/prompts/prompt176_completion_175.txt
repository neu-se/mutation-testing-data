  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method is called on the `url` variable, which would return a string representation of the URL, whereas the original code fragment simply returns the `url` variable, which is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.href
```
This would result in different behavior because the `href` property is accessed on the `url` variable, which would return the full URL string, whereas the original code fragment simply returns the `url` variable, which is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pathname` property is accessed on the `url` variable, which would return the pathname of the URL, whereas the original code fragment simply returns the `url` variable, which is an object.

DONE.
