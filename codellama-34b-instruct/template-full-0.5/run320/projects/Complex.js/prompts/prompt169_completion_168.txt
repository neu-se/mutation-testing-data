  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if either `this` or `z` is zero, while this replacement checks if both are zero. This would cause the `return Complex['ZERO'];` statement to be executed only if both `this` and `z` are zero, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']() || z['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if either `this` or `z` is zero, while this replacement checks if either is NaN. This would cause the `return Complex['ZERO'];` statement to be executed if either `this` or `z` is NaN, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isZero']()
```
This would result in
