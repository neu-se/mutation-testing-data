 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fs.writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `_fs` variable instead of the `fs` parameter, which could cause issues if the user has provided a custom `fs` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.write
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.write` is not a valid function in Node.js's file system module, and would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify` is not a function in Node.js's file system module, and would throw a `TypeError`. It also doesn't write the stringified JSON to a file, which is the intended behavior of the `writeFileSync` function.

DONE.
