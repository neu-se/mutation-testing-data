  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c != '+'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original line `c === '+'` checks whether `c` is a plus sign, while the modified line `c != '+'` checks whether `c` is not a plus sign. This change would cause the subsequent code to execute differently, potentially leading to unintended consequences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '-'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original line `c === '+'` checks whether `c` is a plus sign, while the modified line `c === '-'` checks whether `c` is a minus sign. This change would cause the subsequent code to execute differently, potentially leading to unintended consequences.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNaN(c)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original line `c === '+'` checks whether `c` is a plus sign, while the modified line `!isNaN(c)` checks
