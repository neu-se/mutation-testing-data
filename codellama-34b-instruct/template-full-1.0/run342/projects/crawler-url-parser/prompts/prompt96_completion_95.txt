  Option 1: A suitable buggy code fragment to replace the PLACEHOLDER in the parse() function to change the behavior of the function could be `undefined`, 
This would result in the `if (parsedUrl.protocol && parsedUrl.protocol !== 'http:' && parsedUrl.protocol !== 'https:') return null;` line being executed and the function returning null, which is different from the original behavior where the function would proceed to the next steps if the protocol is not 'http:' or 'https:'.

Option 2: Another suitable buggy code fragment to replace the PLACEHOLDER in the parse() function to change the behavior of the function could be `href, baseUrlStr + "/randomPage"`,
This would result in the `href` variable being changed to a completely different URL which would cause the `parse()` function to return a URL object with completely different attributes and values, which would be a different behavior from the original code where the `parse()` function would return a URL object with attributes and values that match the original URL.
