  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `replace` method to remove the last part of the path, while this code fragment uses a regular expression to remove the last part of the path and any trailing slashes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.split("/").pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `split` method to split the path into an array of parts, while this code fragment uses the `pop` method to remove the last part of the path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.substring(linkurl_path.lastIndexOf("/") + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `lastIndexOf` method to find the last occurrence of a slash in the path, while this code fragment uses
