  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would overwrite the entire object `a` with the contents of `b`, instead of only overwriting the properties of `a` that are also present in `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.include(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the properties of `b` to the object `a`, instead of overwriting the properties of `a` with the ones from `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.merge(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would merge the properties of `b` into the object `a`, instead of overwriting the properties of `a` with the ones from `b`.

DONE.
