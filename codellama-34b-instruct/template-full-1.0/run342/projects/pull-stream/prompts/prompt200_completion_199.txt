  Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
!busy
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the boolean value of `busy`, potentially causing the `abort` function to be called when it shouldn't.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it would enable the `abort` function to be called even when `map` is not busy, potentially causing the program to exit prematurely.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
abort !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `abort` function is not null, potentially causing the program to exit prematurely if `map` is not busy.

DONE.
