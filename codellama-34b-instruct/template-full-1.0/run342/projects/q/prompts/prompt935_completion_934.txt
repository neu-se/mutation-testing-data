  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
None
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return `None` instead of a slice of the `object` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object[object.length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the last element of the `object` array instead of a slice of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return `null` instead of a slice of the `object` array. DONE.
