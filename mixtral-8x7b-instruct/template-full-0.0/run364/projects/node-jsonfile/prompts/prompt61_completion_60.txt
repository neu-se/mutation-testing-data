 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof content === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the type of `content` instead of using the `Buffer.isBuffer` method. This would cause issues when dealing with binary data or Buffer objects, as it would incorrectly treat them as strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content instanceof ArrayBuffer
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `content` is an ArrayBuffer, while the original code checks if it's a Buffer. This would cause issues when dealing with Buffer objects, as it would incorrectly treat them as ArrayBuffers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
global.Buffer.isBuffer
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the global scope to access the `Buffer` object, while the original code uses the `Buffer` object from the Node.js core module. This could cause issues if the application defines a different `Buffer` object in the local scope.
