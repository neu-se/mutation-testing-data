  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call(thisp, value, index, self) + 1
```
This change will cause the callback function to be called with an incorrect argument, which may cause the function to produce incorrect results or throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call(thisp, value, index, self) - 1
```
This change will cause the callback function to be called with an incorrect argument, which may cause the function to produce incorrect results or throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call(thisp, value, index, self) * 2
```
This change will cause the callback function to be called with an incorrect argument, which may cause the function to produce incorrect results or throw an error.

DONE.
