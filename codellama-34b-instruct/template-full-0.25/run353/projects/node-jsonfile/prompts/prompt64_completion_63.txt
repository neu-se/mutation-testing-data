  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'utf16'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Buffer.toString()` method would convert the buffer to a UTF-16 string instead of a UTF-8 string, which could cause issues if the string is not properly encoded.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'ascii'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Buffer.toString()` method would convert the buffer to an ASCII string, which could cause issues if the string contains non-ASCII characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'base64'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Buffer.toString()` method would convert the buffer to a base64 string, which could cause issues if the string is not properly encoded.

DONE.
