  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.query(path, verb, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `query` method to be called on the `rule` object, which may have a different implementation than the `query` method on the `Policy` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.query(path, verb, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `query` method to be called on the `rule` object, which may have a different implementation than the `query` method on the `Policy` class.
