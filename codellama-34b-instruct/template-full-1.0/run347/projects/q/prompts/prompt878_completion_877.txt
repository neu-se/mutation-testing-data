  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` is a function that resolves the promise with the provided argument, whereas `nodeArgs.push` is a function that adds an element to the end of an array. Using `deferred.resolve` instead of `nodeArgs.push` would cause the code to resolve the promise immediately with the value of `deferred.makeNodeResolver()`, which is a function and not an error, and the promise would not be rejected with an error as expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that is not a function, and it would cause a type error when attempting to call the function with the provided arguments. Using `null` instead of `nodeArgs.push` would cause the code to throw a type error, and the promise would not be rejected with an error as expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
