  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is an object, and `undefined` is a primitive value. The `typeof` operator would return "object" for `a`, while `a === undefined` would return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is an object, and `null` is a primitive value. The `typeof` operator would return "object" for `a`, while `a !== null` would return `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is an object, and `{}` is an empty object. The `typeof` operator would return "object" for `a`, while `a !== {}` would return `true`.

DONE.
