  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[^/]+\/$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment allows for the presence of a slash in the middle of the path, while the new fragment does not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^.+\/+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment requires the path to end with a slash, while the new fragment requires the path to start with a slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^.+\/+\*$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment allows for the presence of a star in the middle of the path, while the new fragment requires the path to end with a star.

DONE.
