  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodeURI
```
This would result in different behavior because `decodeURI` only decodes escape characters and does not support decoding non-ASCII characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodeURIComponent(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because `decodeURIComponent` decodes the entire URL, not just the basename.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodeURIComponent(pathname)
```
This would result in different behavior because `decodeURIComponent` decodes the entire URL, not just the basename, and `pathname` is the URL without the protocol and hostname.

DONE.
