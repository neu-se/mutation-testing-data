  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c.id, options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `id` property of the `c` object as the first argument to `getCountry`, instead of passing `c` itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c, { ...options, deprecated: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a new object with the `deprecated` property set to `true`, instead of passing the original `options` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry(c.id, { ...options, deprecated: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `getCountry` with the `id` property of `c` as the first argument, and a new object with the `deprecated` property set to `true` as the second argument, instead of passing `c` and `options` directly.

DONE.
