  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1 * str
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication would result in a negative value, which could cause the `writeFileSync` function to fail or produce unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello" + str
```
This would result in different behavior because the concatenation would produce a new string that includes the content of `str` as well as the string `"hello"`, which could cause the `writeFileSync` function to behave differently, such as writing to a different file or producing a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `writeFileSync` function to return `undefined` instead of a value, which could cause problems if the function is used as an input to another function or if it is expected to return a value.

DONE.
