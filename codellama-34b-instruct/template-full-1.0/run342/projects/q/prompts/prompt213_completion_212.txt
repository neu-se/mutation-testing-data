  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof value !== "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` checks if `value` is an object with a `then` property, whereas `typeof value !== "object"` only checks if `value` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value !== Object(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` checks if `value` is an object with a `then` property, whereas `value !== Object(value)` checks if `value` is not equal to the `Object` type coercion of `value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.constructor !== Object
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` checks if `value` is an object with a `then` property, whereas `value.constructor !== Object` checks if `value` is not an instance of the `Object` constructor.

DONE.
