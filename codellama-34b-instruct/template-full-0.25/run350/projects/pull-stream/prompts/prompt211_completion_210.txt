  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `aborted` is a boolean value, while `null` is a null value. The `aborted` variable is used to indicate whether the asynchronous operation has been aborted, and the code fragment `aborted` is used to check if the operation has been aborted. Replacing `aborted` with `null` would cause the code to behave differently, as it would no longer be checking if the operation has been aborted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `aborted` is a boolean value, while `undefined` is a special value that indicates that a variable has not been assigned a value. The `aborted` variable is used to indicate whether the asynchronous operation has been aborted, and the code fragment `aborted` is used to check if the operation has been aborted. Replacing `aborted` with `undefined` would cause the code to behave differently, as it would
