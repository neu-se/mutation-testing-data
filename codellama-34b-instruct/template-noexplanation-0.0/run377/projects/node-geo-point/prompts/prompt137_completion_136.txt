  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
adjust(this.longitude) + 1
```
This code fragment will adjust the longitude value by adding 1 to it, which will result in a different behavior than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
adjust(this.longitude) - 1
```
This code fragment will adjust the longitude value by subtracting 1 from it, which will also result in a different behavior than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
adjust(this.longitude) * 2
```
This code fragment will adjust the longitude value by multiplying it by 2, which will also result in a different behavior than the original code fragment.

DONE.
