  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close', () => this.close()
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different. The original code listens for the `'drain'` event, while the modified code listens for the `'close'` event. This could cause the `close()` method to be called at a different time than expected, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
