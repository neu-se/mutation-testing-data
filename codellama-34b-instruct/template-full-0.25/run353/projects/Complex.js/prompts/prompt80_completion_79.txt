  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c !== '+'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the character is a plus sign, while this replacement checks if it is not a plus sign.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '-'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the character is a plus sign, while this replacement checks if it is a minus sign.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '*'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the character is a plus sign, while this replacement checks if it is a multiplication sign.

DONE.
