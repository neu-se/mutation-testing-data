  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]o$|quy$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression has been modified to include the additional case of words that end with 'quy'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]o$|quy$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function has been modified to always append 's' to the word, regardless of whether it ends with 'quy' or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]o$|quy$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function has been modified
