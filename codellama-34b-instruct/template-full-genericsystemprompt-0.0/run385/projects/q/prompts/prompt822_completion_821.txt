  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `object` variable, which is not defined in the provided code snippet. Using `null` instead would cause the `done` method to be called on `null`, which would likely result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `object` variable, which is not defined in the provided code snippet. Using `undefined` instead would cause the `done` method to be called on `undefined`, which would likely result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `object` variable, which is not defined in the provided code snippet. Using a string literal instead would cause the `done` method to be called on a string, which would likely result in an error.

DONE.
