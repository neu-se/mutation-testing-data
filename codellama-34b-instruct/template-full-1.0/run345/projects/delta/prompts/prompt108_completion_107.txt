  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` function would always return an empty array, as the predicate function always returns `0` which is a falsy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` function would always return the original array, as the predicate function always returns `1` which is a truthy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` function would always return an empty array, as the predicate function always returns `false` which is a falsy value.

DONE.
