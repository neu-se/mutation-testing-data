  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end` is a boolean value that indicates whether the stream has ended, while `null` is a null value that does not have the same meaning. Using `null` instead of `end` could cause the stream to behave differently and potentially introduce bugs.
