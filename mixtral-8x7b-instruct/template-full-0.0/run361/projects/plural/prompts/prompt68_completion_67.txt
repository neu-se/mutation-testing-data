 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'memos'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns 'memo' for singular and 'memos' for plural, while the replacement always returns 'memos' regardless of the number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'memoes'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement does not match the original singular or plural form, and would not be covered by the existing tests.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement function is the same as the one used for words ending in 'y', but the test for this rule is only checking for the string 'memo'.

DONE.
