  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacterium'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was looking for a specific string, while the new code fragment would match any string that ends with "ium".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacteria'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was looking for a specific string, while the new code fragment would match any string that ends with "ia".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacteri'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was looking for a specific string, while the new code fragment would match any string that ends with "i".

DONE.
