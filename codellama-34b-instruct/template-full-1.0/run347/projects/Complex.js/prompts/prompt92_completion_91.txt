  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '' : '-') + '1'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add `1` to the result, regardless of whether `minus` is odd or even.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '1' : '-1')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add `1` or `-1` to the result, regardless of whether `minus` is odd or even.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add `1` to the result, regardless of whether `minus` is odd or even.

DONE.
