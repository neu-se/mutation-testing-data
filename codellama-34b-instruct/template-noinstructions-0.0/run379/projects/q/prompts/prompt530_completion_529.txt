  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a resolved promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fulfill
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fulfill` is a function that returns a fulfilled promise, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a resolved promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.async` is a function that returns a promise that is resolved with the value of the first argument, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a resolved promise.

DONE.
