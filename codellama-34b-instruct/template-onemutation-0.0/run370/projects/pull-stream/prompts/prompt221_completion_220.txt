  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` returns the input data, while `null` returns a null value. This change would cause the function to return a null value instead of the expected data, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the program.

DONE.
