  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a method that fulfills a promise with a value, whereas `dispatch` is a method that sends a message to a value in a future turn. Using `this.resolve` would cause the promise to be fulfilled immediately, which is not the intended behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a method that rejects a promise with a reason, whereas `dispatch` is a method that sends a message to a value in a future turn. Using `this.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected immediately, which is not the intended behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method that adds a callback to the promise that is called when the promise is resolved or rejected, whereas `dispatch` is
