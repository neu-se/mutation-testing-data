  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this.close()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` method is not called when the `drain` event is emitted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this.emit('drain')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` method is not called when the `drain` event is emitted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this.close()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` method is not called when the `drain` event is emitted.

DONE.
