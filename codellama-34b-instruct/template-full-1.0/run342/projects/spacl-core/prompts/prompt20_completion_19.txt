  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `string.includes` will return true if the specified string appears anywhere in the original string, while `string.endsWith` will only return true if the specified string appears at the end of the original string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.replace
```
This would result in different behavior because `string.replace` will return a new string with the specified search string replaced with the specified replacement string, while `string.endsWith` is only used to determine if a string ends with a specified suffix.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `string.indexOf` will return the index of the first occurrence of the specified string, while `string.endsWith` is only used to determine if a string ends with a specified suffix.

DONE.
