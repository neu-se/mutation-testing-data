  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ms, new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` parameter is now an instance of `Error`, which would cause the promise to be rejected immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ms, "some string"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` parameter is now a string, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a different error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ms, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` parameter is now `null`, which would cause the promise to be fulfilled instead of rejected.

DONE.
