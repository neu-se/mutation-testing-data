  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj + {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `obj + {}` is a different operation than `obj`, and it would return a new object with the properties of `obj` and an empty object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `obj.toString()` is a different operation than `obj`, and it would return a string representation of the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `obj.length` is a different operation than `obj`, and it would return the length of the object.

DONE.
