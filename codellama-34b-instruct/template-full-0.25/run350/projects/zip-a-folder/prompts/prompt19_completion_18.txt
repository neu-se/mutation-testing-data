  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath, fs.constants.R_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fs.constants.W_OK` flag is missing, which would allow the code to write to the target file even if it doesn't have write permissions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath, fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fs.constants.R_OK` flag is missing, which would allow the code to read from the target file even if it doesn't have read permissions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath, fs.constants.X_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fs.constants.X_OK` flag is not a valid flag for the `fs.access()` method, and would cause the code to throw an error.

DONE.
