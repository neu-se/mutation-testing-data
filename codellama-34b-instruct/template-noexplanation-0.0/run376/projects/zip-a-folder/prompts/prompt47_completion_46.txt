  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, true
```
This change will cause the `directory` method to include the contents of the `src` directory in the archive, rather than excluding them as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, false, { exclude: ['**/*'] }
```
This change will cause the `directory` method to exclude all files and directories in the `src` directory from the archive, rather than including them as in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, false, { include: ['**/*'] }
```
This change will cause the `directory` method to include all files and directories in the `src` directory in the archive, rather than excluding them as in the original code.

DONE.
