  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nfapply(FS.readFile, [__filename])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, while the new code fragment is a variable reference.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nfcall(FS.readFile, __filename)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, while the new code fragment is a function call with a different set of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nfbind(FS.readFile, __filename)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, while the new code fragment is a function call with a different set of arguments and a bound context.

DONE.
