  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(end)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `done` function with the `end` argument, which is not the intended behavior. The original code fragment simply returns the `done` function without calling it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `done` function with `null` as the argument, which is not the intended behavior. The original code fragment simply returns the `done` function without calling it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `done` function with both `end` and `data` as arguments, which is not the intended behavior. The original code fragment simply returns the `done` function without calling it.

DONE.
