  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || !ended
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if both `ended` and `end` are false, while the new code checks if either `end` or `!ended` is true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && !!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `ended` is true and `end` is not true (i.e., `end` is false), while the new code checks if `ended` is true and `end` is true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if both `ended` and `end` are false, while the new code checks if either `ended` or `end` is true.

DONE.
