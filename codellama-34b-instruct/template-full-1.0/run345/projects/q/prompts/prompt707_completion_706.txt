  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object would be sliced starting from the second argument instead of the first, which could cause confusion and lead to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `args` is not defined in the scope of the fragment, and would throw a reference error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object would be sliced starting from the third argument instead of the first two, which could cause confusion and lead to unexpected results.

DONE.
