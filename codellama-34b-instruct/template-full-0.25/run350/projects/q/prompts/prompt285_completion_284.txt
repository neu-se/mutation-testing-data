  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking for the presence of a value, and the new code fragment would always return `null`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if a value was present.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking for the presence of a value, and the new code fragment would always return `undefined`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if a value was present.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking for the presence of a value, and the new code fragment would always return `0`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if a value was present.

DONE.
