  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.delete(baseUrlStr);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` method is not being called on the `urlMap` object, which would cause the `baseUrlStr` to not be removed from the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set(currentUrl.url, currentUrl);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method is not being called on the `urlMap` object, which would cause the `currentUrl` object to not be added to the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clear` method is not being called on the `urlMap` object, which would cause the map to not be emptied.

DONE.
