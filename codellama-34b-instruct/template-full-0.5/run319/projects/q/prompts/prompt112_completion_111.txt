  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call(thisp, index, value, self)
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments passed to the callback function would be different, which could cause issues if the callback function relies on the specific order of the arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(thisp, [value, index, self])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method would pass the arguments as an array, rather than as individual arguments, which could cause issues if the callback function relies on the specific order of the arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call(thisp, value, index, self, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra `undefined` argument would be passed to the callback function, which could cause issues if the callback function does not expect an extra argument.

DONE.
