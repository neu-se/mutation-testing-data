  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dstOffset + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the DST offset based on the current time zone offset, but adding 1 to the offset would make the resulting DST offset incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
utcOffset
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the DST offset based on the current time zone offset, but using the UTC offset instead would make the resulting DST offset incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dstOffset - utcOffset
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the DST offset based on the current time zone offset, but subtracting the UTC offset from the DST offset would make the resulting DST offset incorrect.

DONE.
