Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(reject(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with the provided value instead of fulfilling it, leading to a promise that is always in a rejected state when `fulfill` is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(Q(null));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would fulfill the promise with `null` instead of the intended value, potentially leading to unexpected results for consumers of the promise who expect the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(Q(value + " modified"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would fulfill the promise with a modified version of the original value (appending " modified" to it), which could lead to incorrect assumptions about the value that the promise resolves to.

DONE.
