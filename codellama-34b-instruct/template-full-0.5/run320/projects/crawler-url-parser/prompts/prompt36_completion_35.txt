  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would not be called when the `currentUrlStr` is undefined, which could lead to incorrect parsing of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!currentUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would be called when the `currentUrlStr` is not defined, which could lead to incorrect parsing of the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would not be called when the `currentUrlStr` is undefined, which could lead to incorrect parsing of the URL.

DONE.
