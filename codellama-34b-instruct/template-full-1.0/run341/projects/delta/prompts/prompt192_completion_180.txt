  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'insert' &&
            otherIter.peekLength() === firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the next operation in the other iterator is an insert and if its length is equal to the remaining length of the first operation in the this iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator to the next operation instead of checking for insert operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek().retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the next operation in the other iterator is a retain operation instead of an insert operation.

DONE.
