  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length < 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to enter the `if` block when `arguments.length` is 0, whereas the original code would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to enter the `if` block when `arguments.length` is greater than 1, whereas the original code would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to enter the `if` block when `arguments.length` is 0, whereas the original code would not.

DONE.
