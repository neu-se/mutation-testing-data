  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be using the longitude of the first point instead of the second point, which could cause errors in the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be using the latitude of the first point instead of the longitude, which could cause errors in the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be using a constant value of 0 instead of a variable, which could cause errors in the calculation.

DONE.
