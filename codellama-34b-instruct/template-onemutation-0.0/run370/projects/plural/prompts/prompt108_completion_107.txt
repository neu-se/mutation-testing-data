  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the input word unchanged, while the new code fragment returns the input word with the last letter removed and "es" added to the end. This would cause the plural function to return incorrect results for certain words.

DONE.
