  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process === "object" && typeof process.emit === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because `process` is an object, but it is not a string, so the comparison `process === "object"` would return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process === "function" && typeof process.emit === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof process` is "object", but it is not a function, so the comparison `typeof process === "function"` would return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process === "undefined" && typeof process.emit === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because `process` is defined, but `typeof process` is "object", so the comparison `typeof process === "undefined"` would return `false`.

DONE.
