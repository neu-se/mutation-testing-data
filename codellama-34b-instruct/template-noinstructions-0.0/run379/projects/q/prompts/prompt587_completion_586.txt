  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeGenerator` function is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(function* () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeGenerator` function is not called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeGenerator` function is not called.

DONE.
