  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Buffer.isBuffer
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation operator `!` would invert the result of `Buffer.isBuffer`, so if `content` is a buffer, it would be considered not to be a buffer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Buffer.isBuffer()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Buffer.isBuffer` method expects an argument, but the original code fragment did not provide one. If `Buffer.isBuffer` is called without an argument, it would return `true` if the provided argument is a buffer, otherwise it would return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Buffer.isBuffer(content)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Buffer.isBuffer` method expects an argument, but the original code fragment did not provide one. If `Buffer.isBuffer` is called with an argument, it would return `true` if the provided argument is a buffer, otherwise it
