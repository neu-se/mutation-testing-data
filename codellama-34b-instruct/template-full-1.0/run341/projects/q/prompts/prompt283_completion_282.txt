  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(null, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would produce a different slice of the arguments array, potentially changing the outcome of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, -2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would take a different slice of the arguments array, potentially changing the outcome of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would take a different slice of the arguments array, potentially changing the outcome of the function.

DONE.
