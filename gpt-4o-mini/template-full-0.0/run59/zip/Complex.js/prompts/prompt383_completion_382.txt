Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the trigonometric function from sine to cosine, which will yield different values for the imaginary part of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the sine function with the tangent function, which can produce undefined values (infinity) for certain inputs, leading to different results in the complex calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the calculation from using the sine of `b` to simply adding 1 to `b`, which will significantly alter the output of the complex number's imaginary part.

DONE.
