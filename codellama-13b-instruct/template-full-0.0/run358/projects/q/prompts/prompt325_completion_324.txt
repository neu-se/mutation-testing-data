  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.all
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.all` is a method that returns a promise that is resolved when all of the promises in the input array are resolved, whereas `promise` is a variable that refers to a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all` is a method that returns a promise that is resolved when all of the promises in the input array are resolved, whereas `Q` is a variable that refers to a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.race
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.race` is a method that returns a promise that is resolved when any of the promises in the input array is resolved, whereas `Q` is a variable that refers to a promise.

DONE.
