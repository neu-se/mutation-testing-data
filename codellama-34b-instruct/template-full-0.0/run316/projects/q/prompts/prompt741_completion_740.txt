  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(rejection);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` method would be called with a rejection reason, which would cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(rejection);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` method would be called with a rejection reason, which would cause the promise to be resolved with that reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(rejection);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify` method would be called with a rejection reason, which would cause the promise to be notified with that reason.

DONE.
