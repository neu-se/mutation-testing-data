  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" jack", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method will receive " jack" as the second argument, instead of the expected "post".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" get", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method will receive "get" as the second argument, instead of the expected "post".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" post"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method will receive a malformed argument, as there is only one argument instead of two.

DONE.
