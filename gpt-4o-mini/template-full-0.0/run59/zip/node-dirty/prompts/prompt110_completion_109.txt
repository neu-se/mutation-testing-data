Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'warning'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the event type emitted from 'error' to 'warning', which may not be handled by the listeners expecting an 'error' event, potentially leading to unhandled situations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load'
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits a 'load' event instead of an 'error' event, which could mislead the application into thinking the loading process completed successfully, even when there was a corrupted row.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'data'
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits a 'data' event instead of an 'error' event, which would not appropriately signal that an error occurred during the loading process, potentially causing the application to continue operating under false assumptions.

DONE.
