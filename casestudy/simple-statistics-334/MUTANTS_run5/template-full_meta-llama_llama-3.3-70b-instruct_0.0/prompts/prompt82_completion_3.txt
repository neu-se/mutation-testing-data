Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
indices[r - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the index used for the `quantileSelect` function call, potentially altering the quantile calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
arr.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the length of the array instead of the calculated index, which could lead to incorrect quantile calculations or even an out-of-bounds error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.floor(r)
```
This would result in different behavior because it rounds down the index to the nearest integer, which could change the quantile calculation, especially when the index is not an integer.

DONE.
