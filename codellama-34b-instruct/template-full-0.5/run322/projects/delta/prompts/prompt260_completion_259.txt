  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert, otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the insert operation of the current op with the retain operation of the other op, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain, otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the retain operation of the current op with the insert operation of the other op, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert, otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the insert operation of the current op with the delete operation of the other op, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
