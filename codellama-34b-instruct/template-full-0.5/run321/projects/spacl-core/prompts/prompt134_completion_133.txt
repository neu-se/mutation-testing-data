  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb of this.verbs
```
This would result in different behavior because `of` is a different operator than `in`, and it would cause the code to loop over the keys of the `verbs` object instead of the values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb in this.verbs.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because `keys()` returns an array of the keys in the `verbs` object, and `in` would check if the `verb` is in that array instead of checking if it is a property of the `verbs` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb in this.verbs.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because `values()` returns an array of the values in the `verbs` object, and `in` would check if the `verb` is in that array instead of checking if it is a property of the `verbs` object.

DONE
