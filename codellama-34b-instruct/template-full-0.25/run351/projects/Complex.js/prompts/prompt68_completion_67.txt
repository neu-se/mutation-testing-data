  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(a);
```
This would result in different behavior because `parser_exit` is called with an argument, which would cause the function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(b);
```
This would result in different behavior because `parser_exit` is called with a different argument, which would cause the function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(a + b);
```
This would result in different behavior because `parser_exit` is called with a different argument, which would cause the function to throw an error.

DONE.
