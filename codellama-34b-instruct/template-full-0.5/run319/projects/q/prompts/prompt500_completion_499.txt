  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `value.call` is a different method than `value.apply` and would likely cause a different result to be returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `value.bind` creates a new function with a bound context, whereas `value.apply` and `value.call` simply call the function with a specific context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.toString
```
This would result in different behavior because `value.toString` returns a string representation of the function, whereas `value.apply` and `value.call` actually call the function.

DONE.
