  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was slicing the string from the first character to the second-to-last character, but this new code fragment would slice the string from the first character to the last character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was slicing the string from the first character to the second-to-last character, but this new code fragment would slice the string from the last character to the second-to-last character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was slicing the string from the first character to the second-to-last character, but this new code fragment would slice the string from the first character to the second-to-last character, but with a different offset.

DONE.
