  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!

After analyzing the code, I have identified three potential mutations that could be applied to the PLACEHOLDER to cause different behavior in the code. Here are my suggestions:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the boolean value of `resolvedPromise`, which would affect the outcome of the `if` statement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator would compare the value of `resolvedPromise` with `null`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator would compare the value of `resolvedPromise` with `null`, which would cause the `
