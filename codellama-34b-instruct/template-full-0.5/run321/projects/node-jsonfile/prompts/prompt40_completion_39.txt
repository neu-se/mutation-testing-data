  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromCallback` is a different function than `universalify.fromPromise`. While `fromPromise` takes a promise and returns a function that takes a callback, `fromCallback` takes a function that takes a callback and returns a function that takes a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromNull
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromNull` is a different function than `universalify.fromPromise`. While `fromPromise
