  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r < 1 ? 1 : r
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the logic of the original code fragment, causing the `acos` function to always return 1 instead of the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round(r) > 1 ? 1 : r
```
This would result in different behavior because it would round the value of `r` to the nearest integer before checking if it's greater than 1. This would cause the `acos` function to return a different value than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acos(r).toFixed(2) > 1 ? 1 : r
```
This would result in different behavior because it would round the value of `acos(r)` to two decimal places before checking if it's greater than 1. This would cause the `acos` function to return a different value than the original code fragment.
