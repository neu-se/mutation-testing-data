  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("Testing");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would log a different message to the console.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(res1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would log the value of `res1` to the console, which is not the same as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(res2);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would log the value of `res2` to the console, which is not the same as the original code.

DONE.
