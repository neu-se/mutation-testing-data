  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new OpIterator(slice.ops).next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `next()` method on the `OpIterator` object, which would return the next operation in the iterator. In the original code, the `next` property was accessed, which would return the next operation without calling the `next()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new OpIterator(slice.ops).next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `next()` method on the `OpIterator` object with an argument of `1`, which would return the next `1` operations in the iterator. In the original code, the `next` property was accessed, which would return the next operation without calling the `next()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new OpIterator(slice.ops).next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `next()` method on the `Op
