  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the sine of the imaginary part of the complex number, instead of the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the sine of the sum of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, instead of the real part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the sine of the difference between the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, instead of the real part.

DONE.
