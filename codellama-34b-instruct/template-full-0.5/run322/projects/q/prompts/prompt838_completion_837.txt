  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(null, onUnhandledError);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function would be called with `null` as its first argument, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(onUnhandledError, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function would be called with `null` as its second argument, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {
    onUnhandledError();
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function would be called immediately, without waiting for the promise to be resolved or rejected.

DONE.
