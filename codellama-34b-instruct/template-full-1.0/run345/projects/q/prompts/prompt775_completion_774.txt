  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject()` creates a rejected promise, whereas `Q` would create a resolved promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.resolve()` creates a resolved promise, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.all()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.all()` takes an iterable of promises and returns a promise that resolves when all of the promised values are resolved, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a promise that resolves with an array of values.

DONE.
