  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.+\/$/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match()` method returns `null` if the regular expression does not match, while `match() !== null` returns `true` if the regular expression matches.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.+\/$/) === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value is not a valid return value for the `match()` method, and `Null` is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.+\/$/) === NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match()` method returns `NaN` if the regular expression does not match, while `match() !== NaN` returns `true` if the regular expression matches.

DONE.
