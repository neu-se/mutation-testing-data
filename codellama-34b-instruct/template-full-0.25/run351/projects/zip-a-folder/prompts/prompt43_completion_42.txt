  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
globPart + "*"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match all files in the directory, including those that are not matched by the original glob pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
globPart + "?"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match all files in the directory, including those that are not matched by the original glob pattern, but it would also match files that are not in the directory.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
globPart + "**"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match all files in the directory and all subdirectories, including those that are not matched by the original glob pattern.

DONE.
