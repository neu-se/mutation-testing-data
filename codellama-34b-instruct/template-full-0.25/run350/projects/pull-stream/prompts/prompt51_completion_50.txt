  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!s
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `s` is a function call, while `!s` is a logical NOT operator applied to the function call.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `s` is a function call, while `s + 1` is a mathematical operation that adds 1 to the result of the function call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `s` is a function call, while `s.length` is a property access that returns the length of the result of the function call.

DONE.
