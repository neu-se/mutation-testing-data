  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[4]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would attempt to access an undefined element in the `ref` array, which would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would access the first element in the `ref` array, which would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would access the second element in the `ref` array, which would cause the function to return a different value.

DONE.
