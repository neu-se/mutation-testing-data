Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath, fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks for write permissions instead of both read and write permissions, potentially allowing access when the source directory is not readable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, fs.constants.R_OK | fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks permissions on the `src` variable instead of `targetBasePath`, which could lead to incorrect permission checks for the target file path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath, fs.constants.R_OK & fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the bitwise AND operator instead of the bitwise OR operator, which would incorrectly evaluate the permissions check, likely resulting in a failure to check for either permission correctly.

DONE.
