  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.dispatch` function would be handling the `set` method instead of the `post` method, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.dispatch` function would be handling the `get` method instead of the `post` method, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.dispatch` function would be handling the `delete` method instead of the `post` method, potentially leading to unexpected results.

DONE.
