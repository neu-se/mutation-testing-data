 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'content'
```
This would result in different behavior because the JSON parsing step would be bypassed, and the `content` string would be returned directly, instead of the parsed object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1234
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.parse` function would throw a syntax error, and the error message would indicate that the file contains a numeric value instead of JSON data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.parse` function would throw a syntax error, and the error message would indicate that the file contains a null value instead of JSON data.

DONE.
