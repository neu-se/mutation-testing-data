Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly pluralize uncountable nouns by adding an 's' to them, which is not the intended behavior for words like "bison" or "deer".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly apply the pluralization rule for words that do not end in 'y', potentially transforming words like "deer" into "deeries", which is not a valid plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.toUpperCase() }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the word to uppercase instead of returning it unchanged, which would alter the original word's case and not provide a valid pluralization.

DONE.
