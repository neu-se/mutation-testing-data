  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` returns the sine of the argument in radians, whereas `cos` returns the cosine of the argument in radians. This would lead to incorrect calculation of the bearing and distance between two geographic points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan` returns the tangent of the argument in radians, whereas `cos` returns the cosine of the argument in radians. This would lead to incorrect calculation of the bearing and distance between two geographic points.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan` returns the principal value of the arc tangent of the argument in radians, whereas `cos` returns the cosine of the argument in radians. This would lead to incorrect calculation of the bearing and distance between two geographic points.
