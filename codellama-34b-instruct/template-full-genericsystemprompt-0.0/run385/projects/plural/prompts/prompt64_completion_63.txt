```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'bacteria'`, which is the correct plural form for the word "bacterium".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacteria'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'bacterium'`, which is the correct singular form for the word "bacteria".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
