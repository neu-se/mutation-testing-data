  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setTimeout` function would be called with a delay of 1 millisecond instead of 0, which would cause the `flush` function to be called later than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush, 1000
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setTimeout` function would be called with a delay of 1 second instead of 0, which would cause the `flush` function to be called later than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush, 10000
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setTimeout` function would be called with a delay of 10 seconds instead of 0, which would cause the `flush` function to be called later than expected.

DONE.
