  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(new Error("This is a bug"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deferred.reject` method to be called with a different argument than the original code, which would result in a different error being thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfill(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deferred.fulfill` method to be called with a different argument than the original code, which would result in a different value being used to fulfill the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
notify("This is a bug")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deferred.notify` method to be called with a different argument than the original code, which would result in a different value being used to notify progress listeners of the promise.

DONE.
