  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the error to the nodeback function, while this code fragment passes null instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the error to the nodeback function, while this code fragment passes undefined instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw error
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the error to the nodeback function, while this code fragment throws the error instead.

DONE.
