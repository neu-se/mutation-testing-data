  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise` object would be in a different state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise` object would be in a different state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise` object would be in a different state.

DONE.
