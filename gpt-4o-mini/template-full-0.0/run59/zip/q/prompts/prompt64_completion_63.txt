Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 100);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the delay from 0 milliseconds to 100 milliseconds, which could lead to tasks being executed later than intended, potentially causing issues with timing-sensitive operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setImmediate(flush);
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `setImmediate` instead of `setImmediate.bind(window, flush)`, which may not properly bind the context of `flush` to the `window` object, leading to unexpected results in a browser environment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestAnimationFrame(flush);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the scheduling mechanism to `requestAnimationFrame`, which is designed for rendering updates and may not execute `flush` in the same timing context as `setImmediate`, potentially affecting the order of task execution.

DONE.
