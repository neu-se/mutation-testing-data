  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a valid expression, but it evaluates to `undefined`, which is different from the original `arguments` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is also a valid expression, but it has a different value than `arguments`, which is an array-like object containing the function's arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject()` returns a rejected promise, which would trigger the `.fail()` method in the original code, whereas the `arguments` object would not trigger any promise handling code.

DONE.
