  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.deprecated` is a boolean value that indicates whether the country is deprecated, whereas `options` is an object that contains various options for the `getCountry` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.timezones
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.timezones` is an array of timezone objects, whereas `options` is an object that contains various options for the `getCountry` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.countries
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.countries` is an array of country objects, whereas `options` is an object that contains various options for the `getCountry` function.

DONE.
