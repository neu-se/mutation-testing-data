  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the length of the `unhandledRejections` array instead of checking if the `promise` is present in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() {
    unhandledRejections.push(promise);
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the `promise` to the `unhandledRejections` array only if the promise is resolved, whereas the original code pushes the `promise` to the array regardless of whether it is resolved or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.catch(function() {
    unhandledRejections.push(promise);
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the `promise` to the `unhandledRejections` array only if the promise is rejected, whereas the original code push
