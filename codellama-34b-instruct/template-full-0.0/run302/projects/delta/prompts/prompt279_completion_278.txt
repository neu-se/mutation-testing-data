  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of an object is not necessarily the same as the `length` property of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of an object is not necessarily the same as the `length` property of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of an object is not necessarily the same as the `length` property of an array.

DONE.
