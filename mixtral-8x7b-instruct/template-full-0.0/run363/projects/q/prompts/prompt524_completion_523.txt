 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q(object)` call in the `master` function would receive `null` instead of the provided `object`. This could cause issues if the `Q(object)` constructor has specific behavior for `null` or if it expects a truthy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q(object)` call in the `master` function would receive a function instead of the provided `object`. This could cause issues if the `Q(object)` constructor has specific behavior for functions or if it expects a non-function object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q(object)` call in the `master` function would receive the value of `this` instead of the provided `object`. Depending on the context in which the `master`
