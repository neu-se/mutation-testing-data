 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because `[1, 2, 3]` is an array and doesn't have the `slice` method, causing a `TypeError` to be thrown. The original `array_slice` is a function that is used to slice an array, and not providing it would result in incorrect arguments being passed to `nodeArgs`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, causing a `TypeError` to be thrown. The original `array_slice` is a function that is used to slice an array, and not providing it would result in incorrect arguments being passed to `nodeArgs`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.max
