Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promises when there are still pending promises, which is contrary to the original logic that only resolves when all promises are fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promises if there is at least one pending promise, which would lead to premature resolution instead of waiting for all promises to settle.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only resolve the promises when there is exactly one pending promise, which could lead to incorrect handling of the promise array if there are multiple promises still pending.

DONE.
