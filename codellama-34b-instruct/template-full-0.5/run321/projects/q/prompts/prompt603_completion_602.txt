  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` expects a function as its argument, but `undefined` is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` expects a function as its argument, but `null` is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` expects a function as its argument, but `function() {}` is not the same function as the one that was intended to be passed to `defer`.

DONE.
