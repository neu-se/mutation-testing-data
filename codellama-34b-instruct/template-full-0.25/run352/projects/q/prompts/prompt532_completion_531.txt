  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `spread` is a method that returns a promise for the fulfilled value of the input promise, while `then` is a method that returns a promise for the result of the callback function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).all
```
This would result in different behavior because `spread` is a method that returns a promise for the fulfilled value of the input promise, while `all` is a method that returns a promise for the fulfilled value of an array of promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).race
```
This would result in different behavior because `spread` is a method that returns a promise for the fulfilled value of the input promise, while `race` is a method that returns a promise for the first fulfilled value of an array of promises.

DONE.
