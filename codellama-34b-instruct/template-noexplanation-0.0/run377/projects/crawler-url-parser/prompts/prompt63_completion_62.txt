  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.hostname
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code fragment, but it uses the `hostname` property instead of the `host` property. This change may cause the code to behave differently, depending on the specific implementation of the `URL` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.host + "." + ret.domain
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code fragment, but it adds a dot (`.`) between the `host` and `domain` properties. This change may cause the code to behave differently, depending on the specific implementation of the `URL` class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.host.split(".")[0]
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code fragment, but it uses the `split()` method to extract the first part of the `host` property. This change may cause the code to behave differently, depending on the specific implementation of the `URL` class.

DONE.
