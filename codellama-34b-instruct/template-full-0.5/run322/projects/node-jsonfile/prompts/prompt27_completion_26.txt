  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content, options
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options` object is not a function and would produce a different result when passed as the reviver argument to `JSON.parse()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content, options.reviver + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the reviver function would be called with a different argument, potentially causing the parsing to fail or produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the reviver function would not be called at all, potentially causing the parsing to fail or produce incorrect results.

DONE.
