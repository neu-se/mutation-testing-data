  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because `res === true` checks if the result is equal to `true`, while `res !== true` checks if the result is not equal to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res === false
```
This would result in different behavior because `res === true` checks if the result is equal to `true`, while `res === false` checks if the result is equal to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because `res === true` checks if the result is equal to `true`, while `res !== false` checks if the result is not equal to `false`.

DONE.
