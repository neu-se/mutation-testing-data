 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always treat the content as a string, even if it is a Buffer. The original code correctly checks if the content is a Buffer and converts it to a string if necessary.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always treat the content as a Buffer, even if it is not. This could cause an error if the content is not a Buffer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toString('ascii')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always convert the content to an ASCII string, which may not be valid if the content is not in ASCII format. The original code correctly allows the developer to specify the encoding when converting the content to a string.

DONE.
