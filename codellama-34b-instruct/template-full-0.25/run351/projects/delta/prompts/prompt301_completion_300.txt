  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `eachLine` method would start counting lines from 1 instead of 0, which could cause the predicate function to be called with the wrong line number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `eachLine` method would start counting lines from -1 instead of 0, which could cause the predicate function to be called with a negative line number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `eachLine` method would start counting lines from 0 but with a step size of 2, which could cause the predicate function to be called with a line number that is not a multiple of 2.

DONE.
