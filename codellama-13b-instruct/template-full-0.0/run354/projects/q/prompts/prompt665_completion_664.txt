  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is not an array, but rather an array-like object that contains the arguments passed to the function. Using `arguments` instead of `array_slice(arguments)` would cause the function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array would cause the function to return an empty array, whereas `array_slice(arguments)` would return an array containing the arguments passed to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because an array containing the values `1`, `2`, and `3` would cause the function to return a different result than `array_slice(arguments)`.

DONE.
