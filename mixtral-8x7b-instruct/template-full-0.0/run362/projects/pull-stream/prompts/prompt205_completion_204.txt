 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` value would be overwritten by the `data` value, potentially causing the function to continue executing when it should have stopped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` value would be replaced with `undefined`, potentially causing the function to continue executing when it should have stopped.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
