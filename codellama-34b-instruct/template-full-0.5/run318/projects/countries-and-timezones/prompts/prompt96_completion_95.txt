  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.forEach
```
This would result in different behavior because `map` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array, while `forEach` executes a provided function once for each array element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `map` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array, while `filter` creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.find
```
This would result in different behavior because `map` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array, while `find` returns the value of the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function.

DONE.
