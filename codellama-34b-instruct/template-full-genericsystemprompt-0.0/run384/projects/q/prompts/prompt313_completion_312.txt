  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would not be called on the promise, and the promise would not be resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would not be called on the promise, and the promise would not be resolved or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would not be called on the promise, and the promise would not be resolved or rejected.

DONE.
