  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given number, whereas `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number. This would cause the `equals` method to return `false` for complex numbers that have a real part equal to zero and an imaginary part equal to a non-integer value.

DONE.
