  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return object;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` function would not be called, potentially causing issues downstream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return object[inspect]();
```
This would result in different behavior because we would be calling the `inspect` method on `object`, which may have unintended consequences.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Promise({
        "when": function () {
            return object;
        },
        "get": function (name) {
            return object[name];
        },
        "post": function (name, args) {
            return object[name].apply(object, args);
        },
        "keys": function () {
            return Object.keys(object);
        }
    }, void 0, function inspect() {
        return { state: "fulfilled", value: object };
    });
```
This would result in
