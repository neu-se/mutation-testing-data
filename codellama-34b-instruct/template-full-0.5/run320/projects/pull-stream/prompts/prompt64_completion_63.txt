  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(end === true ? null : end + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls `done` with `end` as an argument, while this new code fragment calls `done` with `end + 1` as an argument. This means that the test cases that check for the correct behavior when `end` is not `null` or `true` would fail, indicating that the test suite is not effective in detecting this type of error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(end === true ? null : end - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls `done` with `end` as an argument, while this new code fragment calls `done` with `end - 1` as an argument. This means that the test cases that check for the correct behavior when `end` is not `null` or `true` would fail, indicating that the test suite is not effective in detecting this type of error.
