  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [args, void 0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments to the "apply" method is reversed, which would cause the wrong argument to be interpreted as the `this` value in the function call.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", undefined, args
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to the "apply" method is missing, which would cause the function to be called with the global object as the `this` value instead of the expected value of `args`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [null, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument to the "apply" method is null instead of undefined, which would cause the function to be called with null as the `this` value instead of the expected value of `args`.

DONE.
