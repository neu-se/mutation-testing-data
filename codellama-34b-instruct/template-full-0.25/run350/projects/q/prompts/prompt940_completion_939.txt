  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would omit the first argument passed to the function, which could cause the function to fail or produce unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only include the first argument passed to the function, which could cause the function to fail or produce unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first two arguments passed to the function, which could cause the function to fail or produce unexpected results.

DONE.
