  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero'](0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method will always return `true` when called with `0`, regardless of the value of `this['re']` and `this['im']`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === 0 && this['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method checks if both the real and imaginary parts are equal to `0`, while the above code fragment only checks if the real part is equal to `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === 0 || this['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method checks if both the real and imaginary parts are equal to `0`, while the above code fragment checks if either the real or imaginary part is equal to `0`.

DONE.
