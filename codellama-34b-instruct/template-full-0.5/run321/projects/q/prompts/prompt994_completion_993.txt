  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deferred.promise.then(function(value) {
    return value;
}, function(error) {
    return error;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is used to handle the resolution of the promise, but the error callback returns the error instead of calling `deferred.reject`. This would cause the promise to be resolved with the error value instead of being rejected with the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deferred.promise.then(function(value) {
    return value;
}, function(error) {
    throw error;
});
```
