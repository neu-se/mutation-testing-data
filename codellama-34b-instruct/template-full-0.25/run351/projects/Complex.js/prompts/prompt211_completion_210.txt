  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a, b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.atan2` function, which takes two arguments and returns the arctangent of the quotient of those arguments. Replacing the arguments with `a, b` would cause the function to return the arctangent of `a / b`, which is different from the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b, a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.atan2` function, which takes two arguments and returns the arctangent of the quotient of those arguments. Replacing the arguments with `b, a` would cause the function to return the arctangent of `b / a`, which is different from the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b, a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.atan
