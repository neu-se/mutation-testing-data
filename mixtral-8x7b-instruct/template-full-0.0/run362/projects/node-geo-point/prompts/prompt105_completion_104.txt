 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(Math.atan(Math.tan(coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 180)) + 180) / 360 * Math.pow(2, zoom)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the latitude's radian and converts it back to degrees using atan and tan functions, which may not provide the same result as the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(coordinate.longitude * Math.PI / 180 + 180) / 360 * Math.pow(2, zoom)
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the longitude to radians before calculating the x-coordinate, which may not provide the same result as the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(coordinate.longitude + 180) / 360 * Math.
