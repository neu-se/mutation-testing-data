  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, so the `dispatch` method would throw an error when trying to invoke it with `nodeArgs` as arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.length = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because `nodeArgs` would be an empty array, so the `dispatch` method would not receive any arguments, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs[0] = deferred.makeNodeResolver();
```
This would result in different behavior because `nodeArgs[0]` would be a function, which would be used as the callback for the `dispatch` method. However, the `deferred.makeNodeResolver` method returns a function that is not the same as the original `nodeArgs[0]` function, so the behavior would be different.

DONE.
