  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise.then(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the `promise` object, which would cause the `makeStackTraceLong` function to be called with a different `promise` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise.catch(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch` method is called on the `promise` object, which would cause the `makeStackTraceLong` function to be called with a different `promise` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise.finally(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finally` method is called on the `promise` object, which would cause the `makeStackTraceLong` function to be called with a different `promise` object.

DONE.
