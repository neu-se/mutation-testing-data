  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.length > 0 && string.endsWith('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the string has a length greater than 1, while this new code fragment checks if the string has a length greater than 0. This means that the new code fragment would match strings with a length of 1, while the original code fragment would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.length > 1 && string.endsWith('/') && string.charAt(0) === '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if the string ends with a forward slash, while this new code fragment also checks if the first character of the string is a forward slash. This means that the new code fragment would only match strings that end with a forward slash and have a length greater than 1, while the original code fragment would match strings that end with a forward slash regardless of their length.
