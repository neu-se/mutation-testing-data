Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because setting `Q.onerror` to `null` would prevent any error handling from occurring, leading to unhandled exceptions being thrown instead of being processed by the error handler.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function() { throw new Error("Custom error"); };
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing the original error handler with a custom one that always throws a new error would change the way errors are reported, potentially leading to misleading error messages and disrupting the normal flow of error handling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(e);
```
This would result in different behavior because logging the error to the console instead of invoking `Q.onerror` would mean that the error is not handled according to the promise's error handling strategy, which could lead to silent failures where the error is ignored and not propagated properly.

DONE.
