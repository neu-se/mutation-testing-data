  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === "function" && typeof module === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `exports` and `module` are objects, while the new code fragment checks if they are functions. This change would cause the code to behave differently in certain situations, potentially leading to unexpected results.

DONE.
