  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number` is a function that returns the number value of a string, whereas `Object` is a function that returns a new object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array` is a function that returns a new array, whereas `Object` is a function that returns a new object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String
```
This would result in different behavior because `String` is a function that returns a new string, whereas `Object` is a function that returns a new object.

DONE.
