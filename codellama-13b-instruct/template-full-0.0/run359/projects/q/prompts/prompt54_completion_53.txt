  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.toString
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.toString` returns a string representation of the `process` object, while `process.toString()` returns the string "process".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.nextTick
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.nextTick` is a function that schedules a task to be executed after the current one, while `process.nextTick()` is a function that schedules a task to be executed after the current one and returns a promise that resolves when the task is executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.domain
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.domain` is a property that returns the current domain, while `process.domain()` is a function that returns the current domain and throws an error if there is no current domain.

DONE.
