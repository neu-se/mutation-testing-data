  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.push(part.slice(1))
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the `slice` method to extract the substring from the `part` variable, starting from the second character. This is a valid replacement, but it may not be the intended behavior, as it does not handle the case where the `part` variable is an empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.push(part.slice(1, -1))
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the `slice` method to extract the substring from the `part` variable, starting from the second character and ending at the second-to-last character. This is a valid replacement, but it may not be the intended behavior, as it does not handle the case where the `part` variable is an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.push(part.slice(1, part.length - 1))
