  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates[0]
```
This code fragment accesses the first element of the `coordinates` array of the `point` object, which is a number representing the longitude of the point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates[1]
```
This code fragment accesses the second element of the `coordinates` array of the `point` object, which is a number representing the latitude of the point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates[0] + point.coordinates[1]
```
This code fragment adds the longitude and latitude of the point, which is a valid operation but may not be the intended behavior of the code.

DONE.
