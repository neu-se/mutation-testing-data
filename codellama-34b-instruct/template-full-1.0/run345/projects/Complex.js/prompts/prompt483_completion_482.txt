  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isNaN']() || this['isFinite']()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `isInfinite` is `false` before calling `isFinite`, but this code fragment checks `isNaN` and `isFinite` separately, which could cause different behavior if `isNaN` and `isFinite` have different implementations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isNaN']() && this['isFinite']) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `isInfinite` is `false` before calling `isFinite`, but this code fragment checks if `isNaN` and `isFinite` are both `true`, which could cause different behavior if `isNaN` and `isFinite` have different implementations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isNaN']() || this['isInfinite']) {
