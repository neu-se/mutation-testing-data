Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the NULL_CHARACTER would now represent the character with the Unicode value of 1 instead of 0, potentially leading to incorrect behavior in the diffing process where the NULL_CHARACTER is used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the NULL_CHARACTER would now represent an invalid Unicode character, which could cause unexpected results or errors when the character is used in string operations or comparisons.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.fromCharCode(65)
```
This would result in different behavior because the NULL_CHARACTER would now represent the character 'A' (Unicode 65), which could interfere with the logic that relies on the NULL_CHARACTER being a placeholder for a non-visible character in the diffing process.

DONE.
