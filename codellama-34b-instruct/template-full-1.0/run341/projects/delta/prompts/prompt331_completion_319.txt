  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[index]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the index of the element being accessed in the `base` array, which could lead to the wrong object being retrieved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base[index + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the next element in the `base` array after the current element, which could lead to a different object being retrieved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the line of code to fail, as `null` is not a valid argument for the `findIndex` method.

DONE.
