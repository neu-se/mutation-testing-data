  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === true ? null : end && null
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now short-circuit the evaluation of the second operand if `end` is `null` or `undefined`. In the original code, the result of the conditional expression would always be `null` if `end` is falsy, but with the new code, the result would be `null && null`, which is `null`. This would change the behavior of the code if `end` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === true ? null : end || null
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now short-circuit the evaluation of the second operand if `end` is truthy. In the original code, the result of the conditional expression would always be `null` if `end` is falsy, but with the new code, the result would be `null || null`, which is `null`. This would change the behavior of the code if `end` is truth
