  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the boolean value of `resolvedPromise`, so if `resolvedPromise` is truthy, `!resolvedPromise` will be falsy, and vice versa. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `resolvedPromise` is truthy, which would result in the `become` function not being called, and the promise not being resolved or rejected.

DONE.
