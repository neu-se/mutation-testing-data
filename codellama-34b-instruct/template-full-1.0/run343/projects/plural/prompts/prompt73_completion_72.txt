  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cello', 'cello'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would return 'cello' instead of 'cellos', which is the correct plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cello', 'cellos'
```
This would result in the same behavior as the original code fragment, and the code would return 'cellos'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cello', 'crows'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would return 'crows' instead of 'cellos', which is the correct plural form for 'cello'.

DONE.
