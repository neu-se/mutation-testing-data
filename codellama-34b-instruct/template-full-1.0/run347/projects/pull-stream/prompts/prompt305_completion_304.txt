  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the logical NOT operator is applied to the `ended` variable, which would invert its truthiness. This means that if `ended` is true, the function will be called with `false`, instead of `true`, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ended` variable is now being used as a condition, rather than being passed as an argument to the function. If `ended` is true, the function will be called with the value of `cb`, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ended` variable is now being used as a condition, rather than being passed as an argument to the function. If `ended` is false, the function will not be called at all, which could cause the function to
