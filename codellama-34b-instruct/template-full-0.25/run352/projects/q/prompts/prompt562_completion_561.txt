  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(exception.value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with the value of the exception, rather than resolving it with the value of the exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(exception.value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with the value of the exception, rather than rejecting it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(exception.value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that is resolved with the value of the exception, rather than using the existing promise.

DONE.
