  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content, options.reviver, options.throws
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throws` option is not being passed to `JSON.parse()`, which could cause the function to return `null` instead of throwing an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content, options.reviver, options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because the `encoding` option is not being passed to `JSON.parse()`, which could cause the function to return a string instead of an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content, options.reviver, options.flag
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flag` option is not being passed to `JSON.parse()`, which could cause the function to return a different result.

DONE.
