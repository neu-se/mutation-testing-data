  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(φ2) + 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deg2rad` function is called on `φ2` twice, which could cause the bearing calculation to be off by a factor of 2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(φ2) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deg2rad` function is called on `φ2` twice, which could cause the bearing calculation to be off by a factor of 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(φ2) + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deg2rad` function is called on `φ2` twice, which could cause the bearing calculation to be off by a factor of 2.

DONE.
