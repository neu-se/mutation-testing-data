  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the length of the `promises` array instead of the index of the argument being applied.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the length of the `arguments` array minus one instead of the index of the argument being applied.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the length of the `arguments` array plus one instead of the index of the argument being applied.

DONE.
