  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ReturnValue !== "definitelynotundefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because "definitelynotundefined" is not a valid value for the `typeof` operator, so the expression would evaluate to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ReturnValue !== "string"
```
This would result in different behavior because "string" is not the same value as "undefined", so the expression would evaluate to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ReturnValue === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because `ReturnValue` is not a function, so the expression would evaluate to `false`.

DONE.
