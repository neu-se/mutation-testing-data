  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().split(" ")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the first word of the link text, rather than the entire link text.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().split(" ").pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the last word of the link text, rather than the entire link text.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().split(" ").slice(1).join(" ")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the second and subsequent words of the link text, rather than the entire link text.

DONE.
