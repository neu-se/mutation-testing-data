  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.delete` is a different operation than `op.retain`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.length` is a different operation than `op.retain`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.attributes` is a different operation than `op.retain`.

DONE.
