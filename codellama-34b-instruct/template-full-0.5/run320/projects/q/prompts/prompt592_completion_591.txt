  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` function expects an array of promises, but `0` is not an array and would cause the function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` function expects an array of promises, but `null` is not an array and would cause the function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` function expects an array of promises, but `[]` is an empty array and would cause the function to return a promise that resolves immediately with an empty array, rather than waiting for the promises to settle.

DONE.
