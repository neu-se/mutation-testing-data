  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, id
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `id` property instead of the `name` property to the `buildTimezone` function, which may cause the function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, name + "X"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a modified `name` property to the `buildTimezone` function, which may cause the function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `undefined` as the `name` argument to the `buildTimezone` function, which may cause the function to return a different result.

DONE.
