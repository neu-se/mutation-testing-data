  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.delay(result.value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.delay` returns a promise that is resolved with the given value after a specified delay, whereas `when` returns a promise that is resolved with the given value immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.delay(result.value, 1000)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.delay` returns a promise that is resolved with the given value after a specified delay, and the delay is set to 1000 milliseconds.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.delay(result.value, function() { return 1000; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.delay` returns a promise that is resolved with the given value after a specified delay, and the delay is determined by the function that is passed as the second argument. In this case, the function returns 1000, which
