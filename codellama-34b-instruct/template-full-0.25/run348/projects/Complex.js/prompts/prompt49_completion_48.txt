  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Number.isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `!Number.isFinite` is the negation of `Number.isFinite`, which checks if a value is a finite number. By replacing it with its negation, the code would be checking if the value is not a finite number, which would cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isNaN` checks if a value is NaN (Not a Number), which is different from `Number.isFinite`, which checks if a value is a finite number. By replacing `Number.isFinite` with `Number.isNaN`, the code would be checking for a different condition, which would cause it to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isInteger
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isInteger` checks if a value is an integer,
