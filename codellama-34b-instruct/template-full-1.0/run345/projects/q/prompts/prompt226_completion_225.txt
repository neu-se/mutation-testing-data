  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `message` array would be filled with `null` values instead of the actual arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `message` array would be filled with empty arrays instead of the actual arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"random string"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `message` array would be filled with the same string instead of the actual arguments.

DONE.
