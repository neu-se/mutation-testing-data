  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `switch` statement would always evaluate to the first case, even if the length of the `args` array is greater than 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `switch` statement would always evaluate to the third case, even if the length of the `args` array is less than 3.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `switch` statement would always evaluate to the last case, even if the length of the `args` array is greater than 1.

DONE.
