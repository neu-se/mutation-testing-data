  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `timeout` parameter is used to calculate the delay before the promise is resolved, and a value of `0` would cause the promise to be resolved immediately, regardless of the value of `ms`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `timeout` parameter is used to calculate the delay before the promise is resolved, and a value of `-1` would cause the promise to be resolved immediately, regardless of the value of `ms`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `timeout` parameter is used to calculate the delay before the promise is resolved, and a value of `null` would cause the promise to be resolved immediately, regardless of the value of `ms`.

DONE.
