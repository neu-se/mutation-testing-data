  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clearInterval
```
This would result in different behavior because `clearInterval` is intended to be used with `setInterval` while `clearTimeout` is intended to be used with `setTimeout`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clearTimeout(timeoutId, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `clearTimeout` would no longer be called with the correct arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clearTimeout()
```
This would result in different behavior because `clearTimeout` would no longer be called with any arguments.
