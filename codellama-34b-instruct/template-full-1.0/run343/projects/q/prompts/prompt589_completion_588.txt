  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async
```
This would result in different behavior because the call to `Q.async` would not be surrounded by parentheses, which would cause a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async();
```
This would result in different behavior because the call to `Q.async` would not be passed any arguments, which could change the behavior of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator).bind(this, arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because the call to `bind` would return a new function that is not equivalent to the original `Q.async` function.

DONE.
