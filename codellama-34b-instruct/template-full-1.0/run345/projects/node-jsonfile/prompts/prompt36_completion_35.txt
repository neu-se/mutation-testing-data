  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was `options`, which references the `options` object passed to the function, while `1 + 1` evaluates to the number 2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was `options`, which references the `options` object passed to the function, while `true` is a Boolean value that does not have the same properties or methods as the `options` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was `options`, which references the `options` object passed to the function, while `"hello"` is a string value that does not have the same properties or methods as the `options` object.

DONE.
