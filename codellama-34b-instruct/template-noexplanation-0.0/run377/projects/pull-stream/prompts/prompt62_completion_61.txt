  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!loop
```
This change will cause the loop to run indefinitely, as the `!` operator will always return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
loop && false
```
This change will cause the loop to exit immediately, as the `&&` operator will return `false` if the left-hand side is `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
loop || true
```
This change will cause the loop to run indefinitely, as the `||` operator will return `true` if the left-hand side is `true`.

DONE.
