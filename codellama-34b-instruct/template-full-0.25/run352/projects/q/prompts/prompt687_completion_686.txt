  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would start the slice at the second argument instead of the first, which could cause the function to behave differently if the first argument is not a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would start the slice at the first argument instead of the second, which could cause the function to behave differently if the second argument is not a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would start the slice at the last argument instead of the second, which could cause the function to behave differently if the last argument is not a promise.

DONE.
