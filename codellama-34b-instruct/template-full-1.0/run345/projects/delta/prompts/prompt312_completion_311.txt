  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, { test: true }, i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a `test` property to the `attributes` object, which may not be desired.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, { recipes: ['chicken', 'beef'] }, i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a `recipes` property to the `attributes` object, which may not be desired.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, { ingredients: ['salt', 'pepper'] }, i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an `ingredients` property to the `attributes` object, which may not be desired.

DONE.
