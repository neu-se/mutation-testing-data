 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { throw new Error('Buggy slice'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would now throw an error instead of performing array slicing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.prototype.filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is expected to slice an array, while `Array.prototype.filter` is used for filtering elements in an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` is a function for rounding a number downwards to the nearest integer, while `array_slice` is expected to slice an array.

DONE.
