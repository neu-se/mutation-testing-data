  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp && typeof lastOp.retain === 'string' && !lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is checking if `lastOp.retain` is a string, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `lastOp` is not `null` or `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp && typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' && lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is checking if `lastOp.attributes` is truthy, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `lastOp` is not `null` or `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp && typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' && lastOp.attributes && lastOp.attributes.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is checking if `last
