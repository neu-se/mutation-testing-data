  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the length of the `other.ops` array is greater than 0, while this code fragment checks if it is greater than 1. This means that if the `other.ops` array has only one element, the original code would return `true`, while this code would return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the length of the `other.ops` array is greater than 0, while this code fragment checks if it is equal to 0. This means that if the `other.ops` array has any elements, the original code would return `true`, while this code would return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment
