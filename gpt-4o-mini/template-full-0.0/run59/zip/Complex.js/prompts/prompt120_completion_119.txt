Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it will return true if either `this` or `z` is infinite, instead of requiring both to be infinite as the original code does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']() && !z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it will return true only if neither `this` nor `z` is infinite, which is the opposite condition of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']() && z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if both `this` and `z` are zero instead of checking for infinity, leading to a different condition being evaluated.

DONE.
