  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a + 1` expression would always be truthy, whereas the original `a` expression would be truthy if `a` is non-zero and falsy if `a` is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a * 2` expression would always be twice the value of `a`, whereas the original `a` expression would be the same value as `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a - 1` expression would always be one less than the value of `a`, whereas the original `a` expression would be the same value as `a`.

DONE.
