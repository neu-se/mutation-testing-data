 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / (coordinate.latitude * Math.PI)
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the calculation, dividing by the latitude instead of multiplying. This would give incorrect results for the `toTile` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 180.001
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a slightly different constant (180.001 instead of 180) for the conversion from degrees to radians. This would cause small differences in the calculated tile coordinates, which could lead to incorrect results in the `toTile` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan(coordinate.latitude) * 180 / Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `atan` function instead of multiplying by `Math.PI /
