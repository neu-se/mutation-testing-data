  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only push the first element of the match to the desiredLines array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!attempt2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the result of the regex match, and would only push the stack line to the desiredLines array if it didn't match the regex.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2 && attempt2[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only push the group 1 of the match (the filename) to the desiredLines array if the match was successful, and would push nothing if the match wasn't successful.

DONE.
