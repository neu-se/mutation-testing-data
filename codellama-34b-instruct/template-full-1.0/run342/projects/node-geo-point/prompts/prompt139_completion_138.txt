  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a longitude value that is 1 degree off from the original value. This could potentially cause issues in calculations involving geographic coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round(this.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would round the longitude value to the nearest integer, which could cause the coordinate to be shifted by up to 0.5 degrees. This could potentially cause issues in calculations involving geographic coordinates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the longitude value, which could cause the coordinate to be shifted by up to 2 degrees. This could potentially cause issues in calculations involving geographic coordinates.

DONE.
