  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^https?:\/\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `URL.parse()` method to parse the URL, which includes the protocol (e.g. `http://` or `https://`). By removing the protocol using `replace()`, the resulting URL will be different and may not be parsed correctly by the `URL.parse()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^https?:\/\//, 'ftp://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `URL.parse()` method to parse the URL, which includes the protocol (e.g. `http://` or `https://`). By replacing the protocol with `ftp://`, the resulting URL will be different and may not be parsed correctly by the `URL.parse()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
