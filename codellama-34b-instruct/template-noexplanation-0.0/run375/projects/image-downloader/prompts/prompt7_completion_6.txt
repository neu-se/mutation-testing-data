  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!extractFilename
```
This change will cause the code to always enter the `if` block, even if `extractFilename` is `false`. This will result in the `options.dest` path being modified, even if it is not necessary.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
extractFilename && path.extname(options.dest)
```
This change will cause the code to only enter the `if` block if `extractFilename` is `true` and `options.dest` has an extension. This will result in the `options.dest` path being modified only if it is necessary.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
extractFilename || path.extname(options.dest)
```
This change will cause the code to enter the `if` block if `extractFilename` is `true` or if `options.dest` has an extension. This will result in the `options.dest` path being modified only if it is necessary
