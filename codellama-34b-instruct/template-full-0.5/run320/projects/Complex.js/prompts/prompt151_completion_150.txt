  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>) || z['isInfinite']()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `this` is infinite, but the new code fragment checks if `z` is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>) || z['isInfinite']() || this['isNaN']()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not check if `this` is NaN, but the new code fragment does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

if (this['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>) || z['isInfinite']() || this['isNaN']() || z['isNaN']()) {
