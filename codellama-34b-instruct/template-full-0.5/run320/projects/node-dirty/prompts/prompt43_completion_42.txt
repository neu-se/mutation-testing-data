  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, val + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operation would change the value of `val` and potentially cause the `if (val === undefined)` check to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, val - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operation would change the value of `val` and potentially cause the `if (val === undefined)` check to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, val * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operation would change the value of `val` and potentially cause the `if (val === undefined)` check to fail.

DONE.
