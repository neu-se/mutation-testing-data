  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the country with the given ID to null, which would cause the `getCountry` function to return null instead of the expected country object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] = { name: 'Invalid Country' };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the country with the given ID to an object with a name property set to 'Invalid Country', which would cause the `getCountry` function to return a different country object than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] = countries[id + 1];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the country with the given ID to the country with the next ID, which would cause the `getCountry` function to return a different country object than expected.

DONE.
