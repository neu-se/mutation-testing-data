  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.inspect().state === "pending";
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `inspect` method to get the state of the promise, while the new code fragment uses the `state` property directly. The `inspect` method is a Q-specific method that returns an object with information about the promise, including its state. The `state` property is a standard property of promises that returns the state of the promise as a string.

DONE.
