  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `cb` function if the `end` parameter is falsy, but this new code fragment would call it regardless of the value of `end`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `data` parameter as-is to the `cb` function, but this new code fragment passes `data + 1` instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `data` parameter as-is to the `cb` function, but this new code fragment passes `null` instead.

DONE.
