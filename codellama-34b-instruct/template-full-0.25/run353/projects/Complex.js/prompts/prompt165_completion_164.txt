  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the object has an `isInfinite` property, while the new code fragment is calling the `isInfinite` method on the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'] = true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the object has an `isInfinite` property, while the new code fragment is setting the `isInfinite` property to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'] = function() { return true; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the object has an `isInfinite` property, while the new code fragment is setting the `isInfinite` property to a function that always returns `true`.

DONE.
