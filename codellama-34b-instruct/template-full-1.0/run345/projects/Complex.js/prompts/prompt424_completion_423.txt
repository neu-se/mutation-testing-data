  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFalse']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFalse` is not a valid method in the `Complex` class, and would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the real part of the number to 0, which was not the case in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the imaginary part of the number to 0, which was not the case in the original code.

DONE.
