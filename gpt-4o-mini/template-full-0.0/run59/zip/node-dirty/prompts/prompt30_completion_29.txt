Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'key'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the string `'key'` instead of the value associated with the actual key, leading to incorrect data retrieval.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `undefined`, regardless of whether the key exists in the `_data` map, effectively making the `get` method useless.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.keys().next().value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first key in the `_data` map instead of the requested key, leading to incorrect data retrieval for any key that is not the first one.

DONE.
