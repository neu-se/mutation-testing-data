  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `parse` function to return a complex number with a real part of 0 and an imaginary part of 0, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `parse` function to return a complex number with a real part of 0 and an imaginary part of 1, regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `parse` function to return a complex number with a real part of 1 and an imaginary part of 0, regardless of the input.

DONE.
