  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `arg` is a number, whereas this replacement checks if `arg` is an empty string or an array with no elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg.toString().includes('number')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `arg` is a number, whereas this replacement checks if the string representation of `arg` contains the substring `'number'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof arg === 'number' && arg % 2 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `arg` is a number, whereas this replacement checks if `arg` is an even number.

DONE.
