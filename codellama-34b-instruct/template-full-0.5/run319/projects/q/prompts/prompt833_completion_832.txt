  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a valid expression that evaluates to `undefined`, whereas `progress` is a variable that may or may not be defined in the scope of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid expression that evaluates to `null`, whereas `progress` is a variable that may or may not be defined in the scope of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `function () {}` is a valid expression that evaluates to a function, whereas `progress` is a variable that may or may not be defined in the scope of the function.

DONE.
