  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip over the first element in the slice, which could be relevant if the slice is being used to find a specific element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex + 3
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip over the first two elements in the slice, which could be relevant if the slice is being used to find a specific element in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include an extra element in the slice, which could be relevant if the slice is being used to find a specific element in the array.

DONE.
