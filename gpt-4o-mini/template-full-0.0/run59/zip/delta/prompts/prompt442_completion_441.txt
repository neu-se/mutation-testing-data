Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always start the substring from the beginning of the string, effectively ignoring the current offset and potentially returning more characters than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the current index of the operations array as the starting point for the substring, which could lead to unexpected results if the index is not at the beginning of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to extract one more character than specified by the length, potentially causing an out-of-bounds error or returning more characters than expected.

DONE.
