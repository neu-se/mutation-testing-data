Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately resolve the promise instead of creating a Node-style callback resolver, potentially leading to incorrect handling of asynchronous operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately reject the promise instead of providing a resolver, which would cause any success callbacks to be skipped and lead to unhandled promise rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push an empty function as the callback instead of a proper Node-style resolver, resulting in the promise not being resolved or rejected correctly, leading to a hanging promise.

DONE.
