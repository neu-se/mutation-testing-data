 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a instanceof Function && a.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `instanceof` operator instead of the `typeof` operator, which would behave differently for built-in and custom functions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.constructor.name === 'Function' && a.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the `constructor.name` property of the `a` variable, which may not be reliable in all environments or when minification is used.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'function' && a.length == 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `==` equality operator instead of the `===` strict equality operator, which could lead to unexpected type coercion.

DONE.
