  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil` rounds a number up to the nearest integer, while `Math.floor` rounds a number down to the nearest integer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number, which can cause the expression `Math.abs(this['im'] * places) / places` to always evaluate to 0, regardless of the value of `this['im']`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random` returns a random number between 0 and 1, which can cause the expression `Math.random(this['im'] * places) / places` to always evaluate to a random number between 0 and 0.1, regardless of the value of `this['im']`.

DONE.
