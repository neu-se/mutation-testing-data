  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) {
    return value;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the promise itself, while the modified code fragment returns a new promise that resolves to the same value as the original promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) {
    return Q(value);
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the promise itself, while the modified code fragment returns a new promise that resolves to the same value as the original promise, but with a different type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) {
    return value + 1;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the promise itself, while the modified code fragment returns a new promise that resolves to the value of the original promise plus 1.

DONE.
