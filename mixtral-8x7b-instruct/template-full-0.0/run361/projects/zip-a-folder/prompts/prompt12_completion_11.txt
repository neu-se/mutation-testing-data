 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.constants.F_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the `access` function would only check if the file exists, not if the process has read or write permissions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.accessSync
```
This would result in different behavior because the `access` function is asynchronous, while `accessSync` is synchronous. This could cause the application to block until the file access check is completed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.promises.stat
```
This would result in different behavior because `stat` returns file status information, while `access` checks if the process has the specified access permissions. This could lead to false positives if the file exists but the process doesn't have the required permissions.

DONE.
