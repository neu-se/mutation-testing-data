  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath, fs.constants.R_OK & fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the bitwise AND operator (`&`) is used instead of the bitwise OR operator (`|`) in the original code fragment. This would cause the `access` method to check if the process has both read and write permissions to the target file path, instead of just one of the permissions.

DONE.
