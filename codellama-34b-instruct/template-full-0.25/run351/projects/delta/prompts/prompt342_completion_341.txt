  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const baseOpData = baseOp.insert;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the value of `baseOp.insert` to `baseOpData`, which is not the same as the original code fragment that assigns the value of `baseOp.insert[0]` to `baseOpData`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const baseOpData = baseOp.insert[1];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the value of `baseOp.insert[1]` to `baseOpData`, which is not the same as the original code fragment that assigns the value of `baseOp.insert[0]` to `baseOpData`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const baseOpData = baseOp.insert[0];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the value of `baseOp.insert[0]` to `baseOpData`, which is not the same as the original code
