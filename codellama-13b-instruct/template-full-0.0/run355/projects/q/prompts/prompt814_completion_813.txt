  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `callback.fcall` is a function call without parentheses, which would result in a syntax error. Adding the parentheses would make the code fragment a function call and execute the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `callback.fcall` is a function call without parentheses, which would result in a syntax error. Adding the parentheses would make the code fragment a function call and execute the function. However, using `bind` would change the context of the function call, which could result in different behavior depending on the context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall.apply(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `callback.fcall` is a function call without parentheses, which would result in a syntax error. Adding the parentheses would make
