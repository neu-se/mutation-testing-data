  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspected.state` property is not defined in the `inspect` function, so the `if` statement would always evaluate to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspected.state` property is not defined in the `inspect` function, so the `if` statement would always evaluate to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspected.state` property is not defined in the `inspect` function, so the `if` statement would always evaluate to `false`.

DONE.
