  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback with the `data` argument, while this replacement calls the callback with both `null` and `data` arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback with the `data` argument, while this replacement calls the callback with both `err` and `data` arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback with the `data` argument, while this replacement calls the callback with both `null` arguments.

DONE.
