  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the array is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if the array is empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the array is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if the array is not empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the array is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if the array is empty or does not exist.

DONE.
