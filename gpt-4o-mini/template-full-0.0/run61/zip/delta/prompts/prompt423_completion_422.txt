Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly adds an extra unit to the index adjustment, potentially causing the index to move beyond the intended position when a delete operation occurs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it subtracts one from the length, which could lead to an incorrect index adjustment, causing the index to be less than expected after a delete operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + offset
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the sum of the current index and offset instead of the length, which would not correctly account for the number of characters deleted, leading to an incorrect final index position.

DONE.
