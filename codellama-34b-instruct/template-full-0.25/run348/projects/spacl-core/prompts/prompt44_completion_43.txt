  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push(`/${part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$1')}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression used in the original code fragment is different from the one in the buggy code fragment. The original code fragment uses the `replace` method to escape any special characters in the `part` string, while the buggy code fragment does not. This means that the buggy code fragment may produce a different result if the `part` string contains special characters.
