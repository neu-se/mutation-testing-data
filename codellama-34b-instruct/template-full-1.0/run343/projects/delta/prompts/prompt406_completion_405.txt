  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the string "hello" regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0 regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return null regardless of the input.

DONE.
