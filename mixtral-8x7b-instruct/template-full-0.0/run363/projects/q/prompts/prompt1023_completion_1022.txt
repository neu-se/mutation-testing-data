 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
return Q(object).nodeify.call(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly sets the `this` context to `null`, which is not the same as the original behavior of using `Q(object)` to maintain the original object context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
return Q(object).nodeify(true);
