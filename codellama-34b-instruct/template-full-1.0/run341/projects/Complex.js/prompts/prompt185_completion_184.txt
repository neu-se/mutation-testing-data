  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.power
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.power` is a non-standard function that is not defined in JavaScript's default Math object. Therefore, it would result in a runtime error when used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(a, z['re'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only raise the base of the complex number to the power of the real part of the exponent, whereas the original code fragment raises the base to the power of a complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * Math.exp(z['re'] * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only multiply the base of the complex number by the exponential of the real part of the exponent, whereas the original code fragment raises the base to the power of a complex number.
