  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different behavior than the original code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0](x)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the first element of the `ref` array as a function, which is not the behavior of the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1](x)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the second element of the `ref` array as a function, which is not the behavior of the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2](x)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the third element of the `ref` array as a function, which is not the behavior of the original code fragment.

DONE.
