Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.options.textNodeName
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to replace entities in the `textNodeName` option instead of the actual `val`, potentially leading to incorrect entity replacement if `textNodeName` contains entity characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
key
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace entities in the `key` instead of the `val`, which could lead to incorrect entity replacement if the `key` contains entity characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
val.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the `val` to uppercase before replacing entities, potentially changing the entity replacement outcome if the entity regex patterns are case-sensitive.

DONE.
