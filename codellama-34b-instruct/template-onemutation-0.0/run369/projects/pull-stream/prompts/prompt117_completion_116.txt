  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length < 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `arguments` object has a length of exactly 2, while the new code fragment checks if the `arguments` object has a length less than 2. This change would cause the function to behave differently when it is called with a different number of arguments.

DONE.
