  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err && abort
```
This would result in different behavior because `err && abort` is always false, while `err || abort` is true when either `err` or `abort` is true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err ? abort : null
```
This would result in different behavior because `err ? abort : null` is always null, while `err || abort` is true when either `err` or `abort` is true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || err
```
This would result in different behavior because `abort || err` is always true, while `err || abort` is true when either `err` or `abort` is true.

DONE.
