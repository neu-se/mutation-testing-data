Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `map` variable to be `null`, leading to a TypeError when the code attempts to call `map(data, ...)`, as `null` is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also cause the `map` variable to be `undefined`, resulting in a TypeError when the code tries to invoke `map(data, ...)`, since `undefined` cannot be called as a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return 42; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` function would now ignore the input data and always return `42`, which changes the output of the `asyncMap` function significantly, regardless of the input data.

DONE.
