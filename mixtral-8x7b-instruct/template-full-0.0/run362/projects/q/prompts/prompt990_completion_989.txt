 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `slice` method of the Array object, which may not work correctly with non-Array objects or if the `arguments` object has fewer than 2 elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1)
