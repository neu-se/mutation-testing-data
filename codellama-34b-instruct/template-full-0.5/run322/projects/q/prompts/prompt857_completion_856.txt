  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clearInterval
```
This would result in different behavior because `clearInterval` is a function that clears the interval timer, whereas `clearTimeout` is a function that clears the timeout timer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` is a function that sets a timeout timer, whereas `clearTimeout` is a function that clears the timeout timer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clearTimeout(timeoutId + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would clear a different timeout timer than the one that was set, which would not have the intended effect.

DONE.
