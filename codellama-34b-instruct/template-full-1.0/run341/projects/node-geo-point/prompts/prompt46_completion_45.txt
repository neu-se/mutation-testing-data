  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `rad2deg` is the inverse function of `deg2rad`, so the final result would be in degrees instead of radians.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 - π/2
```
This would result in different behavior because `π/2` is the offset in radians between the original latitude and the transformed longitude. By subtracting `π/2`, the transformed longitude would be shifted by half a circle in the opposite direction, resulting in a different bearing calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acos(cos(θ))
```
This would result in different behavior because `acos(cos(θ))` would calculate the arccosine of the cosine of the bearing, which would produce a different result than the original `acos(r)` calculation.

DONE.
