  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `resolvedPromise` is undefined, rather than checking if it is falsey.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!resolvedPromise || !promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if either `resolvedPromise` or `promise` are falsey, rather than just `resolvedPromise`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise && promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if both `resolvedPromise` and `promise` are truthy, rather than just `resolvedPromise`.

DONE.
