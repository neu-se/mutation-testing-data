  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.compose
```
This would result in different behavior because `compose` is a method that merges two or more Deltas together, whereas `chop` is a method that removes trailing retain ops from the Delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` is a method that adds a retain operation to the Delta, whereas `chop` is a method that removes trailing retain ops from the Delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.insert(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` is a method that adds an insert operation to the Delta, whereas `chop` is a method that removes trailing retain ops from the Delta.

DONE.
