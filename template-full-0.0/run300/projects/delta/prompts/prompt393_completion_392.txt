  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to advance to the next operation, which may not be intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to return the next operation without advancing to it, which may not be intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to return the length of the next operation without advancing to it, which may not be intended.

DONE.
