Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the `next` method to always retrieve only one operation, potentially skipping over multiple operations that should be processed in the slice.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because calling `next` with `0` would not advance the iterator at all, leading to an infinite loop or incorrect slicing of operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(end - start + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the number of operations retrieved to be one more than intended, which could lead to an out-of-bounds error or incorrect operations being included in the slice.

DONE.
