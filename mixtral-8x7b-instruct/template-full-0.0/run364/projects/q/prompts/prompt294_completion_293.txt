 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the rejection of the promise is replaced with its resolution, potentially causing tests to pass even when the code should have rejected the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the rejection of the promise is replaced with a progress notification, which might not trigger test failures even if the code should have rejected the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the rejection of the promise is replaced with an empty function, which would not trigger any further actions in the promise chain and might cause tests to pass even when the code should have rejected the promise.

DONE.
