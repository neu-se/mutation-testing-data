  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ delete: length + 1 }
```
This change will cause the `delete` operation to delete one more character than intended, which may result in incorrect behavior in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ delete: length - 1 }
```
This change will cause the `delete` operation to delete one fewer character than intended, which may also result in incorrect behavior in some cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ delete: length * 2 }
```
This change will cause the `delete` operation to delete twice as many characters as intended, which may result in incorrect behavior in some cases.

DONE.
