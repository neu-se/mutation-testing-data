  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would extract the previous token instead of the next one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would extract the next two tokens instead of just the next one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i - 1] * tokens[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would extract the product of the previous token and the next one, instead of just the next token.

DONE.
