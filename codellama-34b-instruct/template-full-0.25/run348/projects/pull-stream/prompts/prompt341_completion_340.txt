  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!seen[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT, which means that the expression will be true if `seen[key]` is false, and false if `seen[key]` is true. In the original code, the expression `seen[key]` is used to check if the key is already in the `seen` object, and if it is, the function returns `true` immediately. By using `!seen[key]`, the function will return `true` if the key is not in the `seen` object, and `false` if it is, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
seen[key] = false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `=` operator is used to assign a value to a variable, and in this case, it would assign the value `false` to the `seen[key]` variable. In the original code, the `seen[key]` variable is used to check if the key is
