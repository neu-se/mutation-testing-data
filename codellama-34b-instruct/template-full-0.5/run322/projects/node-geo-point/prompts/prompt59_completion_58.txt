  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `φ1` and `φ2` are different variables representing the latitude of the two points, and using `φ1` instead of `φ2` would cause the calculation to use the wrong latitude value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const θ = atan2(y, x);
```
This would result in different behavior because `θ` is the angle between the two points, and using `atan2(y, x)` instead of `θ` would cause the calculation to use the wrong angle value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const λ2 = λ1 + atan2(y, x);
```
This would result in different behavior because `λ2` is the longitude of the destination point, and using `λ1 + atan2(y, x)` instead of `λ2` would cause the calculation to use the wrong longitude value.

DONE.
