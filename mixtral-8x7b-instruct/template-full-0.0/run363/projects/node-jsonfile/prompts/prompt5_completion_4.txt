 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fs.readFile` callback receives an error as the first argument when it encounters an error, but `null` is not an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFile` expects a file path as the first argument, but an empty object is not a valid file path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
file, 'wrong-options'
