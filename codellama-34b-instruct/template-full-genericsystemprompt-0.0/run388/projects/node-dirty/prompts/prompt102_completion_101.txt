  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because `clear()` removes all elements from the map, whereas `delete` only removes the element with the specified key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(row.key, undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because `set()` sets the value of the element with the specified key, whereas `delete` removes the element with the specified key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete(row.key);
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` removes the element with the specified key, whereas `set()` sets the value of the element with the specified key.

DONE.
