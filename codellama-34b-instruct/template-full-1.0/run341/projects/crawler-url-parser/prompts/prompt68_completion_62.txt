  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl = 'https://example.com';
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always use the hard-coded base URL, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always use a null base URL, which would cause unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl = {url: 'https://example.com'};
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always use a base URL object, regardless of the input.

DONE.
