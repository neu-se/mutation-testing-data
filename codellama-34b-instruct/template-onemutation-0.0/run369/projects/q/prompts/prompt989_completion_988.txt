  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.call(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, but `array_slice.call(arguments, 2)` would return a shallow copy of the `arguments` object starting from the second argument, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.
