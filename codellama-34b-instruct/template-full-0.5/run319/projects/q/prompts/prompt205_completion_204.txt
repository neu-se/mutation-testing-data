  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var fileNameAndLineNumber = getFileNameAndLineNumber(firstLine);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function to be called with the wrong argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var fileNameAndLineNumber = getFileNameAndLineNumber(stackLine);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function to be called with the wrong argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var fileNameAndLineNumber = getFileNameAndLineNumber(lines[0]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function to be called with the wrong argument.

DONE.
