  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` variable is not defined in the original code, and therefore the `if` statement would always evaluate to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` variable is not defined in the original code, and therefore the `if` statement would always evaluate to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
busy
```
This would result in different behavior because the `busy` variable is not defined in the original code, and therefore the `if` statement would always evaluate to `false`.

DONE.
