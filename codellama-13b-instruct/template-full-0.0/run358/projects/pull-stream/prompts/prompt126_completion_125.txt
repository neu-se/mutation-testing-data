  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < max
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be inverted, causing the function to return `true` when `i` is less than `max`, rather than when it is greater than `max`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i === max
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be changed to check for equality instead of inequality. This would cause the function to return `true` when `i` is equal to `max`, rather than when it is greater than `max`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i >= max
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be changed to check for greater than or equal to instead of greater than. This would cause the function to return `true` when `i` is greater than or equal to `max`, rather than when it is greater than `max`.

DONE.
