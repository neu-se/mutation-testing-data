  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `dispatch` method to be called on the `Promise.prototype` object, which is not a valid method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).fail(deferred.resolve);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `dispatch` method to be called on the `Promise.prototype` object, which is not a valid method, and it would resolve the promise instead of rejecting it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).fail(function() {});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `dispatch` method to be called on the `Promise.prototype` object, which is not a valid method, and it would fail the promise with an
