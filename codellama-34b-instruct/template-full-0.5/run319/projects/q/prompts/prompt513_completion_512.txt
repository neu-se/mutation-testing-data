  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"PLACEHOLDER"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a string with the value "PLACEHOLDER", rather than the original value of the variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a null value, rather than the original value of the variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an undefined value, rather than the original value of the variable.

DONE.
