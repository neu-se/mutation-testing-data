  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `newPromise` is a promise object, and `newPromise.promise` is a property of that object that contains the promise's resolution value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `newPromise.resolve` is a function that resolves the promise with a given value, whereas `newPromise` is a promise object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `newPromise.reject` is a function that rejects the promise with a given reason, whereas `newPromise` is a promise object.

DONE.
