  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex + length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the base delta starting from the index `baseIndex + length`, which is not the same as slicing from `baseIndex`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex, baseIndex + length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the base delta starting from the index `baseIndex` and ending at the index `baseIndex + length`, which is not the same as slicing from `baseIndex` to the end of the base delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex, baseIndex + length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the base delta starting from the index `baseIndex` and ending at the index `baseIndex + length - 1`, which is not the same as slicing from `baseIndex` to the end of the base
