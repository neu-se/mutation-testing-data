  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(opLength * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the other iterator would jump over twice as many operations as intended, potentially causing the `otherOp` variable to be set to an unexpected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(opLength + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the other iterator would jump over one more operation than intended, potentially causing the `otherOp` variable to be set to an unexpected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(opLength - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the other iterator would jump over one less operation than intended, potentially causing the `otherOp` variable to be set to an unexpected value.

DONE.
