  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using `Number` to convert the value of `attempt1[2]` to a number, whereas this code fragment is returning the string "undefined" instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using `Number` to convert the value of `attempt1[2]` to a number, whereas this code fragment is returning negative infinity instead of undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
5
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using `Number` to convert the value of `attempt1[2]` to a number, whereas this code fragment is returning 5 instead of undefined.

DONE.
