  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the hyperbolic cosine of the input value, while the modified code fragment calculates the negative hyperbolic cosine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh(b) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the hyperbolic cosine of the input value, while the modified code fragment calculates the hyperbolic cosine of the input value plus 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the hyperbolic cosine of the input value, while the modified code fragment calculates the hyperbolic cosine of the conjugate of the input value.

DONE.
