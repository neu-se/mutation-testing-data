  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `cb`, so if `cb` is truthy, `!cb` would be falsy, and if `cb` is falsy, `!cb` would be truthy. This would cause the function to behave differently than the original code, which always called the `cb` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add 1 to the value of `cb`, which would cause the function to behave differently than the original code, which always called the `cb` function with the same value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method would change the value of `this` inside the `cb` function, which could cause it to behave differently than the original code.
