Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it initializes the deferred object with `null`, which may lead to unexpected behavior when resolving or rejecting the promise, as it does not create a proper deferred object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer("error");
```
This would result in different behavior because it initializes the deferred object with a string "error", which is not a valid state for a deferred object and could cause the promise to be resolved incorrectly or not at all.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(42);
```
This would result in different behavior because it initializes the deferred object with a number `42`, which is not a valid argument for creating a deferred object, potentially leading to runtime errors or incorrect promise handling.

DONE.
