  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key, val) === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `forEach` method would iterate over all key-value pairs in the map, even if the `fn` function returns `true` for some of them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key, val) !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `forEach` method would not iterate over any key-value pairs in the map, even if the `fn` function returns `false` for some of them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key, val) === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `forEach` method would iterate over all key-value pairs in the map, even if the `fn` function returns `undefined` for some of them.

DONE.
