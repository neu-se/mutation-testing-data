  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, which would cause the `fromLngLatArray()` method to interpret the coordinates in the wrong order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method returns a new array with the specified number of elements from the original array, starting from the specified index. In this case, it would return an array with only the longitude coordinate, which would cause the `fromLngLatArray()` method to interpret the coordinates in the wrong order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.concat([0])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat()` method returns a new array with the specified elements added to the end of the original array. In this case, it would return an array with an extra element at the end,
