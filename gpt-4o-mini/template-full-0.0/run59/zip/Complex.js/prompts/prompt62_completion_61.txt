Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['theta']
```
This would result in different behavior because it refers to a different property (`theta`) that may not exist on the object `a`, potentially leading to `undefined` being used in calculations instead of the expected angle value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['r']
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `r` property instead of `phi`, which may lead to incorrect calculations if the `r` value is not intended to represent the angle, thus affecting the resulting complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['phi'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the value of `phi` by adding 1, which changes the angle used in the calculations, potentially leading to incorrect results in the complex number representation.

DONE.
