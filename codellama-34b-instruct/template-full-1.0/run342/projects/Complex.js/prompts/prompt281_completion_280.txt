  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-sinh(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the `sinh` function would be flipped, resulting in a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin` and `sinh` are different mathematical functions, and would result in a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cosh` and `sinh` are different mathematical functions, and would result in a different value.

DONE.
