  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because when the code is run, it would take the first element of the array and not the last element as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because when the code is run, it would take the last element of the array and not the first element as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because when the code is run, it would take the first element of the array and then increment the index by one.

DONE.
