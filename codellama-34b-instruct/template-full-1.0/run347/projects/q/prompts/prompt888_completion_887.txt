  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a promise for the resolution of the given promise before the timeout, regardless of whether the promise resolves or rejects, while the original code would only reject the promise if the given promise does not resolve before the timeout.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would reject the promise with a custom error message if the given promise resolves before the timeout, while the original code would only reject the promise with a custom error message if the given promise does not resolve before the timeout.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would resolve the promise with a null value if the given promise resolves before the timeout, while the original code would only reject the promise with a custom error message if the given promise does not resolve before the timeout.

DONE.
