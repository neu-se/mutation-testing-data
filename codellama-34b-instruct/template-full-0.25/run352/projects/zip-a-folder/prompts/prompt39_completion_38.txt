  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first part of the glob pattern, potentially missing other files that match the pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',').slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the second and subsequent parts of the glob pattern, potentially missing the first file that matches the pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',').slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first and second parts of the glob pattern, potentially missing the last file that matches the pattern.

DONE.
