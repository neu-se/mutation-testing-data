  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw reason;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error instead of returning a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reason;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the rejection reason instead of returning a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a rejected promise with the rejection reason, which is different from the original code that returns a rejected promise with the error object.

DONE.
