  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort, abort, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, which would cause the `abortCb` function to be called with the wrong set of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, cb, onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` argument is now passed as the second argument to `abortCb`, instead of the first.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, abort, onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` argument is now passed as the first argument to `abortCb`, instead of the second.

DONE.
