  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ended` is truthy, while this replacement checks if it is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && !last
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ended` is truthy, while this replacement checks if `ended` is truthy and `last` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || !last
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ended` is truthy, while this replacement checks if `ended` is truthy or `last` is falsy.

DONE.
