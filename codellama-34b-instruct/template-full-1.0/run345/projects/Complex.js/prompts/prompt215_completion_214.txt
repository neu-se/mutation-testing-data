  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a + b` has a different value than `a, b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(a, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.max(a, b)` has a different value than `a, b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a * b` has a different value than `a, b`.

DONE.
