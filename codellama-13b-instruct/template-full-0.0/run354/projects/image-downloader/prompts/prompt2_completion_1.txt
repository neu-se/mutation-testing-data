  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Promise.resolve` function returns a resolved promise, whereas the original code fragment returns a rejected promise. This could cause the test suite to pass when it should fail, indicating that the test suite may not be effective in catching this type of error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(new Error('Invalid URL'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Promise.reject` function returns a rejected promise with a custom error message, whereas the original code fragment returns a rejected promise with a generic error message. This could cause the test suite to pass when it should fail, indicating that the test suite may not be effective in catching this type of error.
