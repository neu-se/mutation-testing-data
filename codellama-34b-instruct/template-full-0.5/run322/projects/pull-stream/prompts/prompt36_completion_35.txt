  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ref[3]` expression would return a different value than `ref[2]`, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ref[2] + 1` expression would return a different value than `ref[2]`, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ref[2] * 2` expression would return a different value than `ref[2]`, which could cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
