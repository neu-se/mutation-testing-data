  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pathname.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the last segment of the pathname, rather than the entire pathname.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pathname.replace(/\//g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove all forward slashes from the pathname, rather than just the last one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pathname.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the pathname without the last character, rather than just the last forward slash.

DONE.
