Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.indexOf("node:") !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly identify stack lines from Node.js as internal frames only if they contain the substring "node:", potentially missing valid internal frames that contain "(node.js:") in their format.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.includes("module.js")
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the method of checking for the presence of "module.js" from `indexOf` to `includes`, which could lead to different results in environments where the line format may vary, especially if the line is not a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.startsWith("at ")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider lines that start with "at " as valid stack lines, potentially excluding valid internal frames that do not follow this exact format, thus leading to incorrect filtering of stack traces.

DONE.
