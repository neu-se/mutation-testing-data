  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting promise would be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.on('error', resolve)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function would be called instead of the `reject` function when an error occurs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.on('close', reject)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function would be called instead of the `resolve` function when the output stream is closed.

DONE.
