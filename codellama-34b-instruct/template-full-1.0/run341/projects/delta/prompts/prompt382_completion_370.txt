  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(<PLACEHOLDER> != null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses strict equality comparison, while this code uses loose equality comparison. If the `PLACEHOLDER` is `null` or `undefined`, the result of the loose equality comparison would be `false`, while the result of the strict equality comparison would be `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(<PLACEHOLDER> != undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses strict equality comparison, while this code uses loose equality comparison. If the `PLACEHOLDER` is `undefined`, the result of the loose equality comparison would be `false`, while the result of the strict equality comparison would be `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(!<PLACEHOLDER> || <PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses strict equality comparison,
