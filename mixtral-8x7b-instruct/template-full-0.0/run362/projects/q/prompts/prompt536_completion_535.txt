 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve()` returns a promise that is already resolved, while the original code creates a new promise using the `Q` constructor, which may have different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` creates a promise that is immediately rejected with the given value, while the original code creates a new promise using the `Q` constructor, which may have different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new function(){};
```
This would result in different behavior because `new function(){};` creates a new empty object, while the original code creates a new promise using the `Q` constructor, which may have different behavior.

DONE.
