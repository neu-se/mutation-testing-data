  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.delete(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` method removes the key-value pair from the map, whereas the `get` method returns the value associated with the key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, [])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method overwrites the value associated with the key, whereas the `get` method returns the value associated with the key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size
```
This would result in different behavior because the `size` property returns the number of key-value pairs in the map, whereas the `get` method returns the value associated with the key.

DONE.
