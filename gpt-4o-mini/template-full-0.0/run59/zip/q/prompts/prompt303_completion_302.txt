Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1, len = answerPs.length
```
This would result in different behavior because starting the index `i` at `1` instead of `0` would cause the first promise in the `answerPs` array to be skipped, potentially leading to incorrect results or missed resolutions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0, len = answerPs.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because increasing the `len` by `1` would cause the loop to attempt to access an out-of-bounds index in the `answerPs` array, resulting in an error or undefined behavior when trying to resolve a promise that does not exist.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0, len = answerPs.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because reducing the `len` by `1` would cause the loop to iterate one less time than intended, potentially missing the last promise in the `answerPs` array and leading to incomplete resolution of promises.

DONE.
