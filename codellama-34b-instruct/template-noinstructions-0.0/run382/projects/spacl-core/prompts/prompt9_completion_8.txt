  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/\//g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regex would cause the regex to match all occurrences of `//` in the string, rather than just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/\//i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regex would cause the regex to match `//` in a case-insensitive manner, so it would also match `//`, `//`, `//`, etc.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/\//m
```
This would result in different behavior because the `m` flag at the end of the regex would cause the regex to match `//` in a multiline manner, so it would also match `//` at the beginning of a line, as well as `//` at the end of a line.

DONE.
