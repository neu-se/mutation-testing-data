  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"key" + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the string "key" with the number 1, resulting in the string "key1".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the number 1 to the value of the variable "key", which could result in a different value than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + "1"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the value of the variable "key" with the string "1", resulting in a different string than the original code fragment.

DONE.
