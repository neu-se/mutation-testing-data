  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() * 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deg2rad` function is intended to convert degrees to radians, whereas `Math.random() * 360` would return a random value between 0 and 360, which is not relevant to the context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(θ) - sin(θ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deg2rad` function is intended to convert degrees to radians, whereas `cos(θ) - sin(θ)` would return a value that is not related to the conversion of degrees to radians.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI * 2 - θ
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deg2rad` function is intended to convert degrees to radians, whereas `Math.PI * 2 - θ` would return a value that is not related to the conversion of
