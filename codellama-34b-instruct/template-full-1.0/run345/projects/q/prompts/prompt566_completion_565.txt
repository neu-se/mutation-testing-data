  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function is used to reject a promise, whereas `when` is used to provide a value to a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is used to create a new deferred object, whereas `when` is used to provide a value to a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is used to resolve a promise with a value, whereas `when` is used to provide a value to a promise.

DONE.
