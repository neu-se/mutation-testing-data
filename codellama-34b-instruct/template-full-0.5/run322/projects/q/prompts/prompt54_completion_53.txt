  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.toString.call(process)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `toString` method to be called on the `process` object, which would return a string representation of the `process` object, rather than the string `"[object process]"`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.toString.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `toString` method to be called on the current object, which would return a string representation of the current object, rather than the string `"[object process]"`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.toString.call(window)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `toString` method to be called on the `window` object, which would return a string representation of the `window` object, rather than the string `"[object process]"`.

DONE.
