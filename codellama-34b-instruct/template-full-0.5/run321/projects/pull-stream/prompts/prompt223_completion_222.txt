  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester.not
```
This would result in different behavior because `tester.not` is a different function than `tester`, and it may have different behavior or produce different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!tester
```
This would result in different behavior because `!tester` is a different operation than `tester`, and it may produce different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester.not(test)
```
This would result in different behavior because `tester.not(test)` is a different operation than `tester`, and it may produce different results.

DONE.
