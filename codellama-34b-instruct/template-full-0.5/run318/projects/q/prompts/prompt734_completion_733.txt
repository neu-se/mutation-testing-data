  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `promises` as-is, while this option uses `promises.slice(1)` which returns a new array with all elements except the first one. This means that the resulting promise will be resolved with a different value than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.filter(function(promise) { return promise.state === "fulfilled"; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `promises` as-is, while this option uses `promises.filter()` to filter out any promises that are not in the "fulfilled" state. This means that the resulting promise will be resolved with a different value than the original code, as it will only contain the promises that have been fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.map(function(promise) { return promise.value; })
```
