  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(() => this._writeStream.destroy(new Error('Intentional error')));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `destroy` method would be called with an error, which would cause the write stream to be closed with an error, rather than being closed gracefully.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(() => this._writeStream.destroy(null));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `destroy` method would be called with `null` instead of an error, which would cause the write stream to be closed without an error, but the `close` event would still be emitted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(() => this._writeStream.destroy(undefined));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `destroy` method would be called with `undefined` instead of an error, which would cause the write stream to be closed without an error,
