  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex.prototype.isNaN = function() { return true; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` method would always return `true`, even if the complex number is actually a valid number. This would cause the `isNaN` method to be considered buggy, as it would always return the opposite of the correct result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex.prototype.isFinite = function() { return false; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite` method would always return `false`, even if the complex number is actually a finite number. This would cause the `isFinite` method to be considered buggy, as it would always return the opposite of the correct result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex.prototype.isInfinite = function() { return true; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method would always return `true
