  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^https?:\/\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would remove the `https://` or `http://` protocol from the URL, which could cause the `parse` function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^https?:\/\//, 'ftp://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would replace the `https://` or `http://` protocol with `ftp://`, which could cause the `parse` function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^https?:\/\//, 'file://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would replace the `https://` or `http://` protocol with `file://`, which could cause the `parse` function to return a different result.
