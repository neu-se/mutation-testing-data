  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("This is a buggy error message");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws a specific error message, while the buggy code fragment throws a different error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("This is a different buggy error message");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws a specific error message, while the buggy code fragment throws a different error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("This is a buggy error message");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws a specific error message, while the buggy code fragment throws a different error message.

DONE.
