  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\/\//) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the path contains double forward slashes, and the new code fragment checks if the path does not contain double forward slashes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\/\//) !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the path contains double forward slashes, and the new code fragment checks if the path contains double forward slashes or if the `match` method returns `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\/\//) !== '//'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the path contains double forward slashes, and the new code fragment checks if the path contains double forward slashes or if the `match` method returns a string that is not equal to `'//'`.

DONE.
