  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.inspect` is a function, and `this.inspect.then` would be undefined, causing the code to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.inspect` is a function, and `this.inspect.catch` would be undefined, causing the code to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.finally
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.inspect` is a function, and `this.inspect.finally` would be undefined, causing the code to throw an error.

DONE.
