  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.constructor.name
```
This code fragment will return the name of the constructor function that created the object `a`, which is the same as the original code fragment `typeof a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.toString()
```
This code fragment will return a string representation of the object `a`, which is the same as the original code fragment `typeof a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.valueOf()
```
This code fragment will return the primitive value of the object `a`, which is the same as the original code fragment `typeof a`.

DONE.
