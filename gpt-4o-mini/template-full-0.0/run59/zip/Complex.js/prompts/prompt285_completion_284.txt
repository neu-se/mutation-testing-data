Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the calculation from using the hyperbolic cosine function to the regular sine function, which will yield incorrect results for the cosine of a complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(b) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the cosine of `b`, which alters the expected output of the cosine function and could lead to incorrect results in the complex number calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cosh(b) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the hyperbolic cosine of `b` by 2, which will incorrectly scale the result and lead to erroneous calculations for the complex cosine function.

DONE.
