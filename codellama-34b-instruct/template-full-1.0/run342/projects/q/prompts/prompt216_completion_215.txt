  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coerce - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `coerce - 1` returns the value of `coerce` minus 1, which could cause the program to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coerce * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `coerce * 2` returns the value of `coerce` multiplied by 2, which could cause the program to produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coerce / 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `coerce / 0` would cause a divide by zero error, which would cause the program to crash.

DONE.
