  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the line number in the stack trace would be 1 less than the actual line number, which could cause debugging confusion.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the line number in the stack trace would be 1 greater than the actual line number, which could cause debugging confusion.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the line number in the stack trace would be twice the actual line number, which could cause debugging confusion and potentially cause the program to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
