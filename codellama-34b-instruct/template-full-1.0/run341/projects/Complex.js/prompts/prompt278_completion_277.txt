  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the variable `b` directly, which may have caused the error. By subtracting 1 from `b`, the result is different, and the error is exposed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c
```
This would result in different behavior because `c` is a different variable than `b`, and using it instead may cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because adding 1 to `b` changes the result, and the error is exposed.

DONE.
