 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(a) / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it only calculates `e^c / 2` instead of `(e^c + e^-c) / 2`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cos(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the cosine of `a` instead of the hyperbolic cosine of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the reciprocal of `re` instead of `(e^c + e^-c) / 2`. This could lead to incorrect results or exceptions when `re` is 0.

DONE.
