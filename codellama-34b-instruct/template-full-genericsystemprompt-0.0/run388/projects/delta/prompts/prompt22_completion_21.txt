  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isEqual` would always return the opposite of `isEqual`, which means that the `diff` function would always return a non-empty object, even if the two objects are equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!a[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because `!a[key]` would always return `true` if `a[key]` is not defined, which means that the `diff` function would always return a non-empty object, even if the two objects are equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because `a[key] !== b[key]` would always return `true` if `a[key]` and `b[key]` are not equal, which means that the `diff` function would always return a non-empty object, even if the two objects are equal.
