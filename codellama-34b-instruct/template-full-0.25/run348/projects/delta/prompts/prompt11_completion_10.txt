  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const key of a
```
This would result in different behavior because `const key of a` will iterate over the keys of the `a` object, whereas `const key in a` will iterate over the properties of the `a` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const key in b
```
This would result in different behavior because `const key in b` will iterate over the properties of the `b` object, whereas `const key in a` will iterate over the properties of the `a` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const key = a[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because `const key = a[key]` will assign the value of the `a` object at the current key to the `key` variable, whereas `const key in a` will iterate over the properties of the `a` object.

DONE.
