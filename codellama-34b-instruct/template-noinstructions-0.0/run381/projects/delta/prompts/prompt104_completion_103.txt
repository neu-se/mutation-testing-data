  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op: Op, index: number) => predicate(op, index)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `predicate` function is not being called with the correct arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op: Op, index: number) => predicate(op)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `predicate` function is not being called with the correct number of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op: Op, index: number) => predicate(op, index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `predicate` function is not being called with the correct index.

DONE.
