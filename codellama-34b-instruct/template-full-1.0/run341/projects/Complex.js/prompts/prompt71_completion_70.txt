  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\\d+\\.?\\d*e[+-]?\\d+|\\d+\\.?\\d*|\\.\\d+|./g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regex was removed, which would cause the regex to only match the first occurrence of the pattern in the input string, instead of all occurrences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\\d+\\.?\\d*e[+-]?\\d+|\\d+\\.?\\d*|\\.\\d+|./gi
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag was added at the end of the regex, which would cause the regex to match the input string case-insensitively.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\\d+\\.?\\d*e[+-]?\\d+|\\d+\\.
