  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!shouldThrow
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the boolean value of `shouldThrow`, so the error would not be thrown even if the JSON parsing fails.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
shouldThrow && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator short-circuits the evaluation of the expression, so the error would not be thrown if `shouldThrow` is `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
shouldThrow || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator short-circuits the evaluation of the expression, so the error would be thrown if `shouldThrow` is `true`.

DONE.
