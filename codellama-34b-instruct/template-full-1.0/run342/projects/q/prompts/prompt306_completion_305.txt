  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i <= len; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because it would result in an infinite loop, as the condition `i <= len` would always be true, causing the loop to continue indefinitely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i >= len; i--
```
This would result in different behavior because it would result in the loop never being entered, as the condition `i >= len` would always be false, causing the loop to be skipped entirely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = len; i >= 0; i--
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate in the opposite direction, starting from the last index instead of the first.

DONE.
