  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a method that removes a character or a range of characters from a string, whereas `retain` is a method that changes the color or appearance of a character or a range of characters in a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` is a method that inserts a character or a range of characters into a string, whereas `retain` is a method that changes the color or appearance of a character or a range of characters in a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.replace
```
This would result in different behavior because `replace` is a method that replaces a character or a range of characters in a string with a new character or a new range of characters, whereas `retain` is a method that changes the color or appearance of a character or a range of characters in a string
