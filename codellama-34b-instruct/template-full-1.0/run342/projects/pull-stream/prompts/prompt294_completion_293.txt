  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!last ? null : cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `last` variable is no longer being checked, and the callback function `cb` is now being returned without being called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
last ? null : cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `last` variable is now being checked, but the callback function `cb` is still being returned without being called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function `cb` is now being called twice, once in the outer scope and once in the inner scope.

DONE.
