  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b + b * a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the order of operations, potentially leading to a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * a + a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the order of operations, potentially leading to a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b - b * a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the order of operations and the signs of the terms, potentially leading to a different result.

DONE.
