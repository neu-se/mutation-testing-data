Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush, 1000
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the delay from 0 milliseconds to 1000 milliseconds, causing the flushing of tasks to occur much later than intended, potentially leading to delayed execution of queued tasks.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(function() { /* do nothing */ }, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a function that does nothing, effectively preventing the flushing of tasks from occurring, which could lead to tasks being stuck in the queue and never executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, -1);
```
This would result in different behavior because using a negative timeout is invalid and may cause the `flush` function to not be called at all, leading to a failure in processing the queued tasks.

DONE.
