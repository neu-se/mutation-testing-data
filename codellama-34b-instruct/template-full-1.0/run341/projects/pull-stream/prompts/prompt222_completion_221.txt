  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, data
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value from `null`, and it would change the result of the expression `cb(null, data)` to `cb(undefined, data)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the result of the expression `cb(null, data)` to `cb(null, null)`, which would pass a different value to the callback function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the result of the expression `cb(null, data)` to `cb(null, data + 1)`, which would pass a different value to the callback function.
