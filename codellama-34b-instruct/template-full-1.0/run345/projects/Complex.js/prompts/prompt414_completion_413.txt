  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - Math.sqrt(a * a + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt(a * a + 1)` would yield a different result from `a + Math.sqrt(a * a + 1)` when `a` is negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI + Math.sqrt(a * a + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of Math.PI would change the result of the square root calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * Math.sqrt(a * a + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the square of `a` would be multiplied by the result of the square root calculation.

DONE.
