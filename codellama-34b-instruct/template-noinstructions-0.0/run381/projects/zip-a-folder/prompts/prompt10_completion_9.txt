  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isGlob
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `isGlob` function, causing the `zipArchive.glob()` method to be called even if the `src` parameter is not a glob.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isGlob` function is called without any arguments, which would cause an error to be thrown if the `src` parameter is not a glob.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isGlob` function is called with the `src` parameter, which would cause the `zipArchive.glob()` method to be called only if the `src` parameter is a glob.

DONE.
