  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `catch` is a different method than `then`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.finally
```
This would result in different behavior because `finally` is a different method than `then`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(null, rejection)
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` takes two arguments, a callback for the fulfilled case and a callback for the rejected case, whereas `catch` only takes one argument, a callback for the rejected case.

DONE.
