  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a variable that is not defined in the scope of the function, so it would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value in JavaScript, but it is not a function, so it would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty function is not the same as the function that was originally called, so it would cause a different code path to be executed.

DONE.
