  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[i] !== value
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison operator is different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[i] > value
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison operator is different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[i] + value
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison operator is different.

DONE.
