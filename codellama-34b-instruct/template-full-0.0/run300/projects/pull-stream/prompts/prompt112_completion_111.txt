  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc + data
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the comma operator, which evaluates both operands and returns the second one. In contrast, `acc + data` uses the addition operator, which returns the sum of `acc` and `data`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc * data
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the comma operator, which evaluates both operands and returns the second one. In contrast, `acc * data` uses the multiplication operator, which returns the product of `acc` and `data`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc - data
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the comma operator, which evaluates both operands and returns the second one. In contrast, `acc - data` uses the subtraction operator, which returns the difference of `acc` and `data`.

DONE.
