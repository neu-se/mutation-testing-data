  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.toString();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method returns a string representation of the object, which may not be the expected behavior when trying to normalize the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.substring(5);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first five characters of the URL, which may not be desired.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.toUpperCase();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the URL to uppercase, which may not be desired.

DONE.
