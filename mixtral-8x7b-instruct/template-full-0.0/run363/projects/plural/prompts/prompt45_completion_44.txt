 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
rules.push([/[aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' }])
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `push` instead of `unshift`, adding the rule to the end of the `rules` array instead of the beginning.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
rules.unshift({match: /[aeiouy]o$/i, result: function(w) { return w + 's' }})
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses an object instead of an array to represent the rule, which would cause the `type(rule[0]) === 'RegExp'` check to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
rules.unshift([/[aeiouy]o$/i, 's'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a string instead of a function
