  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function to return a different value, which would then be used to determine whether the stack trace should be filtered or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function to return `undefined`, which would then be used to determine whether the stack trace should be filtered or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function to return `null`, which would then be used to determine whether the stack trace should be filtered or not.

DONE.
