Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
encodeURI(normalizedUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because `encodeURI` is used instead of the original code, which would change the way the URL is decoded and potentially lead to different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
normalizedUrl.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the URL is converted to uppercase before being decoded, which could affect the decoding process and lead to different outcomes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
url
```
This would result in different behavior because the original URL is used instead of the normalized URL, which could bypass some of the normalization steps and lead to different decoding results.

DONE.
