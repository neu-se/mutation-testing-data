  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method that returns a promise, whereas `tap` is a method that returns the original promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `catch` is a method that returns a promise that is rejected with the error, whereas `tap` is a method that returns the original promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).finally
```
This would result in different behavior because `finally` is a method that returns a promise that is resolved with the original promise, whereas `tap` is a method that returns the original promise.

DONE.
