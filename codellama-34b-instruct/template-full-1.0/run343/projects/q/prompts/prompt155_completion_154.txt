  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filterStackString(stackString)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `filterStackString` function to be called twice, which would result in an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
concatedStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `concatedStacks` string to be returned as the `stack` property of the error object, rather than the filtered version returned by the `filterStackString` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the first stack trace element to be used as the `stack` property of the error object, rather than the filtered version returned by the `filterStackString` function.

DONE.
