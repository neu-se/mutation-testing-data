  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc + acc
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the value of `acc` instead of passing it as is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass null as a parameter to the function, instead of the expected `acc`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a random number as a parameter to the function, instead of the expected `acc`.

DONE.
