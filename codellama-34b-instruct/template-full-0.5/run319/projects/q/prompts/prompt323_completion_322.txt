  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise, args, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `1` would be passed as an additional argument to the `promiseDispatch` method, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments would be passed in a different order, which could cause issues if the `promiseDispatch` method is expecting a specific order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise[args]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `args` as a property accessor to the `promise` object, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
