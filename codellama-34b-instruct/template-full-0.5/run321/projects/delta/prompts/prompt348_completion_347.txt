  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData, baseOpData.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, which would cause the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function to return different values, leading to different behavior in the `invert` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData, baseOpData[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first element of the `baseOpData` array, which could lead to incorrect results if the array contains more than one element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData, baseOpData[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the second element of the `baseOpData` array, which could lead to incorrect results if the array contains more than two elements.

DONE.
