  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a - b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses addition, while this replacement uses subtraction.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b + b * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses multiplication, while this replacement uses addition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b - b * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses multiplication, while this replacement uses subtraction.

DONE.
