  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return OBJECT.then(ft, rt, progress);
```
This would result in different behavior because `OBJECT.then` does not match the original code `Q(object).then`, and would cause a different promise chain to be constructed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return object.then(undefined, rt, progress);
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.then` does not match the original code `Q(object).then`, and would cause a different promise chain to be constructed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(object).then(undefined, rt, progress).then(ft);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(object).then` would update the original promise chain, which would not happen with `OBJECT.then` or `object.then`.

DONE.
