  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter.peekLength()` line to be executed, which would return the length of the next operation in the `other` delta, rather than the length of the current operation in `this` delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter.peekLength()` line to be executed, which would return the length of the next operation in the `other` delta, rather than the length of the current operation in `this` delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to never execute, as the `length` variable would always be set to 0.

DONE.
