  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that is called with the arguments `abort` and `onAbort`, while `null` is not a function and would result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that is called with the arguments `abort` and `onAbort`, while `undefined` is not a function and would result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that is called with the arguments `abort` and `onAbort`, while the arrow function `() => {}` is a function that takes no arguments and does not return anything.

DONE.
