  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset % 60
```
This would result in different behavior because `offset % 60` will return the remainder of `offset` divided by 60, whereas `offset / 60` will return the quotient of `offset` divided by 60.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset * 60
```
This would result in different behavior because `offset * 60` will return the product of `offset` and 60, whereas `offset / 60` will return the quotient of `offset` divided by 60.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset + 60
```
This would result in different behavior because `offset + 60` will return the sum of `offset` and 60, whereas `offset / 60` will return the quotient of `offset` divided by 60.

DONE.
