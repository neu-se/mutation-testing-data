  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned value would always be 0, regardless of the length of the operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned value would always be 1, regardless of the length of the operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned value would always be -1, regardless of the length of the operation.

DONE.
