  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the attributes of the `otherOp` object instead of the `baseOp` object, which could cause the `AttributeMap.invert` method to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.length()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the length of the `baseOp` object instead of its attributes, which could cause the `AttributeMap.invert` method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.length()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the length of the `otherOp` object instead of its attributes, which could cause the `AttributeMap.invert` method to return a different result.

DONE.
