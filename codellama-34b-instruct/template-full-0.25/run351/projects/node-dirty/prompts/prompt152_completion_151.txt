  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this._waitForDrain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the boolean value of `this._waitForDrain`, causing the `break` statement to be executed even if `this._waitForDrain` is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._waitForDrain === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, which means that `this._waitForDrain` must be `true` for the `break` statement to be executed. If `this._waitForDrain` is `false`, the `break` statement will not be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._waitForDrain !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, which means that `this._waitForDrain` must not be `true` for the `break` statement to be executed
