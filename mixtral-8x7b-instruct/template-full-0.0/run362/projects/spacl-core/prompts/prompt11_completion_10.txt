 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/[^/]:|:\/|:$/g) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag in the regular expression makes it match all occurrences instead of just the first one, potentially causing the function to throw an error when it shouldn't.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/[^/]:|:\/|:\s/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `\s` character class is added, which matches any whitespace character, potentially causing the function to throw an error when it shouldn't.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/[^/]:|:\/|:/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `$` is removed, which matches the end of the string, potentially causing the function to throw an error when it shouldn't.

DONE.
