  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.sin` method returns the sine of a number, whereas the `Math.abs` method returns the absolute value of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.cos` method returns the cosine of a number, whereas the `Math.abs` method returns the absolute value of a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.tan` method returns the tangent of a number, whereas the `Math.abs` method returns the absolute value of a number.

DONE.
