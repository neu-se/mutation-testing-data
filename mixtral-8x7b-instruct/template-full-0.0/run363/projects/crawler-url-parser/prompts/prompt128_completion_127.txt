 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pageurl instanceof URL
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `pageurl` is an instance of the URL class, rather than checking its type as a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pageurl === window.location
