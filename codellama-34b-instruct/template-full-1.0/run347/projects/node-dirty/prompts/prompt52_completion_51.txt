  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
blank
```
This would result in different behavior because the `update` method would always set the value of the key to `undefined`, even if it was not originally undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nonExistentKey
```
This would result in different behavior because the `update` method would always attempt to set the value of a non-existent key, which would result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `update` method would always increment the value of the key by 1, regardless of its original value.

DONE.
