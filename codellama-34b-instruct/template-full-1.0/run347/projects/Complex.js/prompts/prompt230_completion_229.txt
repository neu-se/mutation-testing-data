  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the square root using the positive value of `b`, while the mutated code calculates the square root using the negative value of `b`. This could potentially cause the calculation for the real part of the complex square root to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the square root using the value of `a`, while the mutated code calculates the square root using the value of `b`. This could potentially cause the calculation for the real part of the complex square root to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the square root using the square of the complex number, while the mutated code calculates the square root using the value of `1`. This could potentially cause the calculation for the real part of the complex square root to be incorrect.
