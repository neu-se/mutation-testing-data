  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork();
```
This would result in different behavior because `uncork` is a method that unblocks the stream, allowing data to flow through it, whereas `cork` is a method that blocks the stream, preventing data from flowing through it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write(data, (err) => {
  if (!cbs.length && err != null) this.emit('error', err);
  if (--this._inFlightWrites <= 0 && !this._waitForDrain) this.emit('drain');
  for (const cb of cbs) cb(err);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `write` method with a different callback function, which would potentially cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write(data, (err) =>
