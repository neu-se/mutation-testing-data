Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/b/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex now checks for the letter 'b' instead of 'a', which means it will not match words that contain 'a' before 'man', thus changing the intended pluralization behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/man/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex now matches the string 'man' directly, which would cause it to pluralize 'man' to 'men' only when the word is exactly 'man', ignoring any variations that might include 'wo' or other prefixes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiou]/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex now matches any vowel instead of specifically looking for 'a', which could lead to incorrect pluralization for words that do not conform to the original rule intended for 'man'.

DONE.
