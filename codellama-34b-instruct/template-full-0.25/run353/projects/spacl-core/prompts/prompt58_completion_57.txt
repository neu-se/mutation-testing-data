  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\$2'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex group reference has been changed from `$1` to `$2`, which would cause the replacement to use the wrong capture group.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\$0'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex group reference has been changed from `$1` to `$0`, which would cause the replacement to use the entire match instead of the first capture group.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\$&'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex group reference has been changed from `$1` to `$&`, which would cause the replacement to use the entire match instead of the first capture group.

DONE.
