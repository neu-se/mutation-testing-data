 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(this.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the instance property `this.latitude` instead of the parameter `φ1`. This could lead to incorrect calculations since `this.latitude` might have a different value than `φ1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the cosine of `φ1` with a constant value of 1. This could lead to incorrect calculations since the actual value of `cos(φ1)` might be less than or greater than 1, depending on the value of `φ1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
