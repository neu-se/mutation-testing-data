 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.makeNodeResolver(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method would receive an argument, which it doesn't in the original code. This could potentially cause issues if the method is not designed to handle unexpected arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.makeChild()
```
This would result in different behavior because `makeChild` is not a method of the `deferred` object, and would cause an error. This highlights the importance of checking for the existence of methods before calling them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return {}; }
```
This would result in different behavior because a new function is returned instead of a promise. This could cause issues if the code that calls this method is expecting a promise and not a function.

DONE.
