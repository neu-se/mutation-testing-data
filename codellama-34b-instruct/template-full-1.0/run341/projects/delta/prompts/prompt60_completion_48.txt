  Here are three possible replacement code fragments for the PLACEHOLDER:
```
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof arg !== 'object' || arg !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code checks whether `arg` is not an object or is null, whereas the original code checks whether `arg` is a string of length zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code checks whether `arg` is undefined, whereas the original code checks whether `arg` is a string of length zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code checks whether `arg` is not undefined, whereas the original code checks whether `arg` is a string of length zero.

DONE.
