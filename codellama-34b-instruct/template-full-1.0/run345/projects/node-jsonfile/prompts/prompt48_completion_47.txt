  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string, while `null` is an object. If the `writeFileSync` function is called with `null` as the third argument, it would throw a `TypeError` when it tries to read the `encoding` property of `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string, while `undefined` is a primitive value. If the `writeFileSync` function is called with `undefined` as the third argument, it would throw a `TypeError` when it tries to read the `encoding` property of `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string, while `{}` is an empty object. If the `writeFileSync` function is called with `{}` as the third argument, it would not throw an error when
