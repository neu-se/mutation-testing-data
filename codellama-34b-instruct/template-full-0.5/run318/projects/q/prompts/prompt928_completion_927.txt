  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object would be replaced with the number 1, which would cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object would be replaced with the string "hello", which would cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object would be replaced with the array [1, 2, 3], which would cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
