  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the previous operation instead of the current one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the next operation instead of the current one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.ops.length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the last operation in the list instead of the current one.

DONE.
