  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('mouse', 'mouses')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the plural "s" to the word "mouse," but this new code fragment adds the plural "es" to the word "mouses."

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('mouse', 'mice')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the plural "s" to the word "mouse," but this new code fragment adds the plural "ice" to the word "mice."

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('mouse', 'mous')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the plural "s" to the word "mouse," but this new code fragment adds the plural "s" to the word "mous."

DONE.
