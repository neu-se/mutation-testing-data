  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `str` is a string, but `null` is not a string, so the behavior of the function would be different when `null` is passed as the third argument to `fs.writeFileSync`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `str` is a string, but `undefined` is not a string, so the behavior of the function would be different when `undefined` is passed as the third argument to `fs.writeFileSync`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `str` is a string, but `0` is a number, so the behavior of the function would be different when `0` is passed as the third argument to `fs.writeFileSync`.

DONE.
