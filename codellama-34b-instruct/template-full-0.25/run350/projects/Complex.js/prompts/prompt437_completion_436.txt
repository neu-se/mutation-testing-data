  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10, places || 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use a minimum value of 1 for the `places` parameter, even if it is not provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10, places || Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use a maximum value of Infinity for the `places` parameter, even if it is not provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10, places || Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a random value for the `places` parameter, even if it is not provided.

DONE.
