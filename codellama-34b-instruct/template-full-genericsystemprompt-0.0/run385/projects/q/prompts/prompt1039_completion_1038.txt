  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.resolve(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Q.reject(error)` to create a rejected promise, while this replacement uses `closed.resolve(error)` to resolve the promise with an error value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve(end);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `ends.resolve(end)` to resolve the promise with a value, while this replacement uses `ends.resolve(end)` to resolve the promise with a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.promise.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Q.reject(error)` to create a rejected promise, while this replacement uses `closed.promise.reject(error)` to create a rejected promise that is resolved with an error value.

DONE.
