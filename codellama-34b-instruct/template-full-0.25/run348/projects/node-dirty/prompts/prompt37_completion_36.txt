  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._queue` is a Map object, and iterating over it would produce a different sequence of key-value pairs than `this._data`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data.values()` returns an iterator over the values in the Map, rather than the key-value pairs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data.keys()` returns an iterator over the keys in the Map, rather than the key-value pairs.

DONE.
