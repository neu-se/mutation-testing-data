  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, cb || function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical OR operator to return a function if `cb` is falsy, while the buggy code fragment uses the bitwise OR operator, which would always return `abort` regardless of the value of `cb`.
