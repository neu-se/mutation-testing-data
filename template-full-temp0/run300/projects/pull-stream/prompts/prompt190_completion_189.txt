  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `map` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `map` is strictly equal to `null`. If `map` is any other falsy value (such as `undefined` or `false`), the original code would still execute the `return id` statement, while this new code would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `map` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `map` has a length of 0. If `map` is any other falsy value (such as `undefined` or `false`), the original code would still execute the `return id` statement, while this new code would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map.hasOwnProperty('length')
```
This would result in different behavior
