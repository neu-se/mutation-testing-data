  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the deferred promise, which is not the same as rejecting the original promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(reject(reason))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the deferred promise and then become a new promise that is rejected with the same reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.reject(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the resolved promise, which is not the same as rejecting the original promise.

DONE.
