  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^\s+|\s+$/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the content, which could potentially change the JSON parsing behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the content to lowercase, which could potentially change the JSON parsing behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the characters in the content, which could potentially change the JSON parsing behavior.

DONE.
