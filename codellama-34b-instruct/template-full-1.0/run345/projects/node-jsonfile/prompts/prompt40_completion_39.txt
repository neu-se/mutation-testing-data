  Here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different behavior than the original code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromAsync
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromAsync` creates a promise-based stream, whereas `universalify.fromPromise` creates a promise-based object that wraps the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromStream
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromStream` creates a stream that represents the promise, whereas `universalify.fromPromise` creates a promise that represents the stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFile)
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromCallback` creates a callback-based function that wraps the stream, whereas `universalify.fromPromise` creates a promise-based object
