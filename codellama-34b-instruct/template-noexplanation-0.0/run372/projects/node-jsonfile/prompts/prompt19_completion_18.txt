  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.toString()
```
This change will cause the `readFileSync` function to throw an error, as `file.toString()` is not a valid file path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file + 'invalid'
```
This change will cause the `readFileSync` function to throw an error, as the file path `file + 'invalid'` does not exist.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.replace('json', 'txt')
```
This change will cause the `readFileSync` function to throw an error, as the file path `file.replace('json', 'txt')` does not exist.

DONE.
