  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `embedType.toLowerCase()` would return a lowercase string, which may not be a valid embed type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `embedType.length` would return the length of the embed type string, which may not be a valid embed type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType.charAt(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `embedType.charAt(0)` would return the first character of the embed type string, which may not be a valid embed type.

DONE.
