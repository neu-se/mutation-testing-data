Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the variable used in the sine calculation from the real part `a` to the imaginary part `b`, which would yield incorrect results for the cosine function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(a + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the input to the sine function by adding 1 to `a`, which would produce a different output than the original calculation of `Math.sin(a)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(a) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the result of the sine function, which would incorrectly increase the imaginary part of the complex number returned by the cosine function.

DONE.
