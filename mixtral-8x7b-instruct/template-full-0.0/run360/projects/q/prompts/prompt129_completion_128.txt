 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
keys.length = keys.length + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly modifies the `length` property of the `keys` array, which could lead to unexpected results in the rest of the code that relies on the correct length of the `keys` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
keys[99999] = 'extra';
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an extra element to the `keys` array, which could lead to unexpected results in the rest of the code that relies on the `keys` array having only the keys present in the original object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
delete keys[0];
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the first element from the `keys` array, which could lead to unexpected results in the rest of the code that relies on the correct keys being present in the `keys` array
