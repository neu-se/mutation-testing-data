  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.test` is a function that checks if a property exists on an object, whereas `test.test` is referring to a property called "test" on the test object.
Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.doesNotExist
```
This would result in different behavior because `doesNotExist` is not a property on the test object, whereas `test.test` is referring to a property called "test" on the test object.
Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"string" === typeof test.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the type of `test.test` is a string, whereas the type of `test` is an object.

DONE.
