  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `test` function, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false` regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator adds 1 to the result of the `test` function, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if the result of `test` is less than 1, and `false` otherwise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator multiplies the result of the `test` function by 2, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if the result of `test` is less than 2, and `false` otherwise.

DONE.
