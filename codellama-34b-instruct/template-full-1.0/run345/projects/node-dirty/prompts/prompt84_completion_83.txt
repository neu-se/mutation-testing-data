  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\t'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the delimiter used to separate the JSON objects in the data stream. Instead of using a newline character, it would use a tab character, which could result in invalid JSON data and potentially cause errors when attempting to parse the data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the delimiter altogether, resulting in a continuous string of JSON objects that would not be parsed correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'!'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the delimiter to an exclamation point, which would not be a valid JSON delimiter and would result in invalid JSON data.

DONE.
