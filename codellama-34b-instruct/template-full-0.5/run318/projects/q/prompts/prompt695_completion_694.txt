  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q` is a constructor function that expects a non-null value as its argument. Passing `null` would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q` is a constructor function that expects a non-null value as its argument. Passing `undefined` would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q` is a constructor function that expects a non-null value as its argument. Passing `0` would cause an error to be thrown.

DONE.
