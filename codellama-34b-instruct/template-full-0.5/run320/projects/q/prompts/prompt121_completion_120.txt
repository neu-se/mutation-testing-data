  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute, as the condition `i < key` would always be false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key = i + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute one extra time, as the condition `i < key` would be true one extra time.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key = i - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute one less time, as the condition `i < key` would be false one less time.

DONE.
