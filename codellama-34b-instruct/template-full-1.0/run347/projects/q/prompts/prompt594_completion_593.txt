  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `self`, changing its value in the scope of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self = null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the value `null` to `self`, causing `self` to refer to `null` instead of the original object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because it would refer to the global object (such as the window) instead of the original object.

DONE.
