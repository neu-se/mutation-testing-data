Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the callback's first argument from `undefined` (which indicates no error) to `false`, signaling an error condition when `abort` is true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, 'error')
```
This would result in different behavior because it provides a second argument to the callback, which is a string 'error', instead of passing `cb` as the first argument, potentially leading to confusion in the handling of the callback's response.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes the value of `abort` (which is a boolean) as the first argument to the callback instead of the original `cb`, which could lead to incorrect handling of the callback's response based on the value of `abort`.

DONE.
