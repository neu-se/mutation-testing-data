  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(Op.length(thisOp));
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.retain` would be called with the length of `thisOp`, which is an `Op` object, instead of the length of `thisOp.retain`, which is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(Op.length(otherOp));
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.retain` would be called with the length of `otherOp`, which is an `Op` object, instead of the length of `thisOp.retain`, which is a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(Op.length(thisOp.retain));
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.retain` would be called with the length of `thisOp.retain`, which is a number, instead of the length of `thisOp`, which is an `
