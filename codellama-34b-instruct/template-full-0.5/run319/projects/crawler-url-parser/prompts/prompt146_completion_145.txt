  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/index\.[a-z]+$/, ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the match with a forward slash, while the new code fragment replaces the match with a space.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/index\.[a-z]+$/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the match with a forward slash, while the new code fragment replaces the match with an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/index\.[a-z]+$/, '?'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the match with a forward slash, while the new code fragment replaces the match with a question mark.

DONE.
