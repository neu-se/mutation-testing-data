  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.indexOf("\n")
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastIndexOf` returns the last occurrence of the specified value, while `indexOf` returns the first occurrence. This means that if there are multiple lines in the chunk, `lastIndexOf` would return the index of the last line, while `indexOf` would return the index of the first line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.split("\n").length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `split` returns an array of substrings, while `lastIndexOf` returns the index of the last occurrence of the specified value. This means that if there are multiple lines in the chunk, `split` would return an array with the length of the number of lines, while `lastIndexOf` would return the index of the last line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.split("\n").pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` returns
