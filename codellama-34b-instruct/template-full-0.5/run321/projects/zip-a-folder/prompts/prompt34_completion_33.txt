  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close', reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the event `'close'` is emitted when the output stream is closed, while the event `'error'` is emitted when there is an error in the stream. Replacing `'error'` with `'close'` would cause the promise to reject when the stream is closed, rather than when there is an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end', reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the event `'end'` is emitted when the output stream has finished writing all data, while the event `'error'` is emitted when there is an error in the stream. Replacing `'error'` with `'end'` would cause the promise to reject when the stream has finished writing all data, rather than when there is an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finish', reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the event `'finish'` is emitted when the output stream has finished writing
