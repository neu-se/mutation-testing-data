  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would refer to the variable `b` instead of `a`, which could introduce errors in the calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the original value of `a`, which could affect the results of the calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would square the original value of `a`, which could change the magnitudes of the subsequent calculations.

DONE.
