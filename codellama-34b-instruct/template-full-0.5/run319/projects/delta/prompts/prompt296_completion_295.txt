  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.push(iter.next())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the next operation from the iterator onto the line, rather than the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.push(iter.peek())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the current operation from the iterator onto the line, rather than the next operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.push(iter.peek(1))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the next operation from the iterator onto the line, rather than the current operation.

DONE.
