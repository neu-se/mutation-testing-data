  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would return `null` instead of the expected plural form of the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would return the word with an extra 's' added to the end, which is not the expected plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would return the word in all caps, which is not the expected plural form.

DONE.
