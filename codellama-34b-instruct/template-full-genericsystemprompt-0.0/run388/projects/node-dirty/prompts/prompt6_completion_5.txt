  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete(key);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets the value at the given key to `undefined`, while this code fragment deletes the key-value pair altogether.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, val + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets the value at the given key to `val`, while this code fragment sets the value to `val + 1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, val * 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets the value at the given key to `val`, while this code fragment sets the value to `val * 2`.

DONE.
