 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / this['re'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the real part is specifically equal to positive or negative infinity, instead of checking if either the real or imaginary part is not a finite number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] > Number.MAX_VALUE || this['im'] > Number.MAX_VALUE
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if either the real or imaginary part is greater than the maximum representable number, instead of checking if either part is not a finite number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.is(this['re'], Infinity) || Object.is(this['im'], Infinity)
