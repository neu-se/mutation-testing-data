  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty('latitude') || object.hasOwnProperty('longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is negating the expression, so the code would return `true` if the `object` has either `latitude` or `longitude` instead of both.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty('latitude') && object.hasOwnProperty('longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is evaluating both expressions, so the code would return `false` if the `object` has only one of the properties instead of returning `true` if it has both.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty('latitude') != object.hasOwnProperty('longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!=` operator is checking that the expressions are not equal, so the code would
