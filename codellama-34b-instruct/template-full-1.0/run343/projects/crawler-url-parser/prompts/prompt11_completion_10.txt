  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^www/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match a different part of the URL. In the original code, `/^\/\//` matches the "//" at the beginning of an absolute URL, but `/^www/` matches the "www" at the beginning of a hostname.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\/$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match the entire URL instead of just the "//" at the beginning.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!localhost)\w+:/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match a different part of the URL. In the original code, `/^\/\//` matches the "//" at the beginning of an absolute URL, but `/^(?!localhost)\w+:/` matches the protocol (e.g. "http" or "https") and the "://" at the beginning of an absolute URL.
