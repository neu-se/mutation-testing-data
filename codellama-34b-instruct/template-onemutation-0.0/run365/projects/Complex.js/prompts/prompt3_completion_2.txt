  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp` is a function that returns the exponential value of its argument, while `Math.exp(x)` is a function call that returns the exponential value of `x`. In the original code, `Math.exp` is used as a function, but in the mutated code, it is used as a function call. This change would cause the function to return a different value, potentially leading to different behavior in the program. DONE.
