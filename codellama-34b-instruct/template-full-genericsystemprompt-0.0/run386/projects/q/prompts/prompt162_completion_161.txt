  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackString.split("\n")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the stack string into an array of lines, whereas the original code fragment splits the stack string into an array of lines and then filters out the internal frames.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackString.split(" ")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the stack string into an array of words, whereas the original code fragment splits the stack string into an array of lines.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackString.split("")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the stack string into an array of characters, whereas the original code fragment splits the stack string into an array of lines.

DONE.
