  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg']
```
This would result in different behavior because `arg` and `phi` are different properties of the `a` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['abs']
```
This would result in different behavior because `abs` and `phi` are different properties of the `a` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because `re` and `phi` are different properties of the `a` object.

DONE.
