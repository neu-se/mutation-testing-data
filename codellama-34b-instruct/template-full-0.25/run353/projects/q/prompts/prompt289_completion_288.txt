```
This would result in different behavior because `resolver.resolve` is a function that would be called with the `deferred.resolve` and `deferred.reject` functions as arguments, whereas `resolver` is a function that would be called with the `deferred.resolve` and `deferred.reject` functions as arguments.

This would result in different behavior because `resolver.notify` is a function that would be called with the `de
