Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return next
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the `next` function itself instead of invoking it, leading to an infinite loop where the `next` function is never executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `next` function to be called immediately, potentially leading to unexpected behavior if the `read` function is still processing, as it would create a new call stack instead of waiting for the current one to finish.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return
```
This would result in different behavior because it would terminate the execution of the `next` function prematurely, preventing any further processing of the stream data and potentially causing the stream to hang or not complete as expected.

DONE.
