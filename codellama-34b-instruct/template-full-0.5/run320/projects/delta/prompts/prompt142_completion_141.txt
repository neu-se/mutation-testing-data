  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength` is a method that returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, and passing `<PLACEHOLDER>` as an argument would cause the method to return the length of the placeholder operation, which is likely to be different from the length of the next operation in the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength(otherIter.peek())
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength` is a method that returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, and passing `otherIter.peek()` as an argument would cause the method to return the length of the next operation in the other iterator, which is likely to be different from the length of the next operation in the current iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength(thisIter.peek())
```
