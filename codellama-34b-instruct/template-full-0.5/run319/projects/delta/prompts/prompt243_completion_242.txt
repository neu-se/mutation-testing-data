  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.peekLength()` would return the length of the peeked operation, which may not be the same as the length of the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekLength()` would return the length of the peeked operation in the other iterator, which may not be the same as the length of the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.peekType()` would return the type of the peeked operation, which may not be the same as the type of the current operation.

DONE.
