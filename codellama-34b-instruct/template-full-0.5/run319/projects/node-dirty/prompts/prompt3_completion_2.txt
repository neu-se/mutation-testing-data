  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `val` is `undefined`, while this replacement checks if it is not `undefined`. This would cause the code to behave differently when `val` is `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof val === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `val` is `undefined`, while this replacement checks if its type is `'undefined'`. This would cause the code to behave differently when `val` is `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!val
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `val` is `undefined`, while this replacement checks if it is falsy. This would cause the code to behave differently when `val` is falsy but not `undefined`.

DONE.
