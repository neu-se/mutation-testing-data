Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing `value` with `null` would cause the promise to fulfill with a `null` value instead of the intended value, potentially leading to unexpected results in any subsequent promise chains that rely on the resolved value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` instead of `value` would fulfill the promise with an `undefined` value, which may not be handled correctly by consumers of the promise, leading to errors or incorrect logic in promise resolution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because fulfilling the promise with the string `"error"` instead of the intended `value` would mislead any promise handlers that expect a valid value, potentially causing them to treat the string as a valid result rather than an error state.

DONE.
