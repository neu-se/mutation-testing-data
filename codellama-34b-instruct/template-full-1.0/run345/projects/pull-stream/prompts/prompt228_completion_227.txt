  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with
```
data - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because data is considered to be a positive number.
Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(data + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because data is considered to be a positive number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const maths = require('maths'); 
  maths.add(data, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it  uses the maths library to add 1 to the value of data.
DONE.
