  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(Op.length(thisIter.next()) + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` method would be called with an incorrect argument, causing the resulting delta to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(Op.length(thisIter.next()) - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` method would be called with an incorrect argument, causing the resulting delta to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(Op.length(thisIter.next()) * 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` method would be called with an incorrect argument, causing the resulting delta to be incorrect.

DONE.
