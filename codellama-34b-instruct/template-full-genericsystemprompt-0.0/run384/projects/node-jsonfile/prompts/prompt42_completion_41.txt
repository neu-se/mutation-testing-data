  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stringify(obj, options) + "bug"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string "bug" would be appended to the JSON string, causing the file to be invalid JSON and potentially causing errors when readFileSync is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stringify(obj, options) + "bug"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string "bug" would be appended to the JSON string, causing the file to be invalid JSON and potentially causing errors when readFileSync is called.
