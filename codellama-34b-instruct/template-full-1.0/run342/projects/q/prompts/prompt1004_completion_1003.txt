  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"pre", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` dispatch method would be replaced with `pre`, causing the function to execute before the dispatch instead of after it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"send", nodeArgs
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` dispatch method would be replaced with `send`, causing the function to be executed with the `nodeArgs` array as its only argument instead of with `name` and `nodeArgs` as separate arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get", nodeArgs
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` dispatch method would be replaced with `get`, causing the function to be executed with the `nodeArgs` array as its only argument instead of with `name` and `nodeArgs` as separate arguments.

DONE.
