Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1, w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the starting index of the substring to 1 instead of 0, which would cause the first character of the word to be omitted in the pluralization process.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, w.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it includes the entire word in the substring, effectively returning the original word without any modification, which would not apply the intended pluralization rule.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, w.length - 3
```
This would result in different behavior because it reduces the length of the substring by 3 instead of 2, which would incorrectly remove the last three characters of the word, potentially leading to incorrect plural forms.

DONE.
