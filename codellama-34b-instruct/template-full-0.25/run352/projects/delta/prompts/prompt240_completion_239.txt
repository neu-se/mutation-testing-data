  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter` is an iterator for the `other` delta, while `thisIter` is an iterator for the `this` delta. Using `otherIter.peekLength()` would cause the code to use the length of the next operation in the `other` delta, which may not be the same as the length of the next operation in the `this` delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to use the length of the next operation in the `this` delta, plus one. This could cause the code to skip over the next operation in the `this` delta, or to include an extra operation in the diff.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to
