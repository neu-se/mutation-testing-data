  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Map` object would throw an error when trying to delete a key that is not present.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Map` object would not throw an error when trying to delete a key that is not present, but it would also not delete the key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Map` object would try to delete a key that is not present, which would result in an error.

DONE.
