  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the string `spec` on whitespace, while this replacement splits it on the empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split(/\s+/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the string `spec` on whitespace, while this replacement splits it on one or more whitespace characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split(/[a-zA-Z0-9_]/g)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the string `spec` on whitespace, while this replacement splits it on any letter, digit, or underscore.

DONE.
