  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.then` returns a promise, and calling `then` on that promise would create a new promise that is resolved with the original promise's fulfillment value or rejection reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.then` returns a promise, and calling `catch` on that promise would create a new promise that is resolved with the original promise's fulfillment value or rejection reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.finally
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.then` returns a promise, and calling `finally` on that promise would create a new promise that is resolved with the original promise's fulfillment value or rejection reason.

DONE.
