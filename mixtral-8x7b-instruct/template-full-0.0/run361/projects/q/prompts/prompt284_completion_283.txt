 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
self.resolve = function() {};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function would be overwritten with an empty function, preventing the promise from being resolved with the given value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
self.reject;
