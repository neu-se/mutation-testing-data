Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/[a-z]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now matching any string that ends with one or more lowercase letters, instead of removing trailing zeros after a decimal point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/0+/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now matching one or more zeros anywhere in the string, not just after a decimal point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/\./
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now matching the decimal point itself, removing it from the string, potentially changing the number's value or causing it to be parsed incorrectly.

DONE.
