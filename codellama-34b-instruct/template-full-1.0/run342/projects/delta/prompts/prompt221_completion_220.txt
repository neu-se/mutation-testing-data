  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const diffResult = other.diff(this, cursor);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `diff` method is not defined on the `this` object, but it is defined on the `other` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const diffResult = this.diff(other, cursor);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `diff` method is defined on the `this` object, but it is not defined on the `other` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const diffResult = Delta.diff(this, other, cursor);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `diff` method is not defined as a static method of the `Delta` class, but it is defined as a method of the `Delta` instance.

DONE.
