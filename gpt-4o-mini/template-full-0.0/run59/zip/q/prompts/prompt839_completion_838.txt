Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because using `null` instead of `void 0` would cause the promise to resolve with `null` instead of being treated as a no-op, potentially leading to unexpected results in promise chains that expect an undefined value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because while `undefined` is similar to `void 0`, it can lead to different handling in some contexts, especially if the promise resolution logic relies on strict equality checks or type coercion.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(new Error("Unhandled error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately reject the promise with a new error instead of allowing it to resolve normally, which could disrupt the flow of promise handling and lead to unhandled promise rejections.

DONE.
