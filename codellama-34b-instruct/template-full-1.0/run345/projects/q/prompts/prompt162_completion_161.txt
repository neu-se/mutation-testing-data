  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackString.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `stackString.slice` returns an array of strings, while `stackString.split` returns a single string with the entire stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackString.substring
```
This would result in different behavior because `stackString.substring` returns a portion of the string, while `stackString.split` returns an array of strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackString.charAt
```
This would result in different behavior because `stackString.charAt` returns the character at the specified index in the string, while `stackString.split` returns an array of strings.

DONE.
