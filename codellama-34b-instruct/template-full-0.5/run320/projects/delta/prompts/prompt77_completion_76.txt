  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!lastOp
```
This would result in different behavior because `!lastOp` would evaluate to `true` if `lastOp` is `null` or `undefined`, whereas `typeof lastOp === 'object'` would evaluate to `false` in those cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof lastOp === 'undefined'` would evaluate to `true` if `lastOp` is `undefined`, whereas `!lastOp` would evaluate to `true` in that case as well as if `lastOp` is `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastOp === undefined` would evaluate to `true` if `lastOp` is `undefined`, whereas `!lastOp` would evaluate to `true` in that case as well as if `lastOp` is `null`, and `typeof lastOp ===
