  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected immediately, whereas `deferred.notify` would allow the promise to continue executing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would cause the promise to be resolved immediately, whereas `deferred.notify` would allow the promise to continue executing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify(reason)` would cause the promise to be notified with the specified reason, whereas `deferred.notify` would allow the promise to continue executing.

DONE.
