 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise` variable would be assigned the value `null` instead of an instance of `Promise.prototype`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Promise(descriptor)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fallback` and `inspect` arguments would not be passed to the `Promise` constructor.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise` variable would be assigned the value of an anonymous function instead of an instance of `Promise.prototype`.

By introducing these changes, the test suite may not catch the errors because the code would still execute without any explicit errors, but the behavior would be different from the original implementation. This would provide a starting point for improving the test suite by adding tests that check for the expected behavior of the `Promise` constructor.

DONE.
