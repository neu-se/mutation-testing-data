 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'none'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the 'none' embed type, which might not be compatible with the actual embed type in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'unknown' as const
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the 'unknown' embed type, which might not be handled correctly in the rest of the code, causing unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
(Math.random() > 0.5 ? 'type1' : 'type2') as const
```
This would result in different behavior because it would randomly choose between 'type1' and 'type2' embed types, causing inconsistent behavior in the code, which might lead to unexpected results or errors.

DONE.
