  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodeURI
```
This would result in different behavior because `decodeURI` does not decode all characters, unlike `decodeURIComponent`, which decodes all characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
encodeURIComponent
```
This would result in different behavior because `encodeURIComponent` encodes all characters, unlike `decodeURIComponent`, which decodes all characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return <some value>; }
```
This would result in different behavior because `decodeURIComponent` is a function that accepts a single argument and returns the decoded value, whereas the new function does not accept any arguments and returns a fixed value.

DONE.
