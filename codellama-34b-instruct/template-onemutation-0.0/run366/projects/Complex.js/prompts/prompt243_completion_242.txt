  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the imaginary part of the complex number is equal to 0, while the new code fragment checks if it is not equal to 0. This change would cause the `exp` method to return a different value when the imaginary part is not 0, which could lead to incorrect results in calculations that use this method.

DONE.
