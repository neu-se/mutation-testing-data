  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `abort`, so the `if` statement would always evaluate to `true` regardless of the value of `abort`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is a logical AND operator, and it would always evaluate to `true` if `abort` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is a logical OR operator, and it would always evaluate to `false` if `abort` is falsy.

DONE.
