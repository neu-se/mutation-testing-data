  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.hasNext` is a function that returns a boolean value indicating whether there are more ops in the iterator, while `otherIter.hasNext()` calls the function and returns the result, which is a boolean value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.hasNext` is a function that returns a boolean value indicating whether there are more ops in the iterator, while `otherIter.hasNext` is a boolean value that indicates whether there are more ops in the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.hasNext()` calls the function and returns the result, which is a boolean value, while `otherIter.hasNext` is a boolean value that indicates whether there are more ops in the iterator.
