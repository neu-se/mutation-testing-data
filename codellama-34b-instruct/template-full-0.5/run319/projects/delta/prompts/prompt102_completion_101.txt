  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.pop(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop` method would remove the last element from the `ops` array, rather than the first element as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.shift(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `shift` method would remove the first element from the `ops` array, rather than the last element as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.unshift(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unshift` method would add the given element to the beginning of the `ops` array, rather than removing the last element as intended.

DONE.
