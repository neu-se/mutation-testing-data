  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(opLength * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the iterator would be advanced by twice the amount of the opLength, which could lead to incorrect results in the diff calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(opLength - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the iterator would be advanced by one less than the opLength, which could lead to incorrect results in the diff calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(opLength + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the iterator would be advanced by one more than the opLength, which could lead to incorrect results in the diff calculation.

DONE.
