  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` and `reject` are different functions with different purposes. `resolve` is used to fulfill a promise, while `reject` is used to reject a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is a statement that interrupts the normal flow of a program and throws an exception, while `reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return null
```
This would result in different behavior because `return null` would return a null value, while `reject` returns a rejected promise.

DONE.
