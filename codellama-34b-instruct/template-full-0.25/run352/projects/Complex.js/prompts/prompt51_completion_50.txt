  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Number.isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `!Number.isFinite` is the negation of `Number.isFinite`, which means that it will return `true` if the argument is not a finite number, and `false` if it is a finite number. This change would cause the function to return `Complex['INFINITY']` for any input that is not a finite number, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isNaN` is a function that checks if the argument is NaN (Not a Number), which is different from checking if the argument is a finite number. This change would cause the function to return `Complex['INFINITY']` for any input that is NaN, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isFinite(a['arg'])
```
