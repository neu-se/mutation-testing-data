  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the test suite may not be able to detect a bug in the `abort` function, which is only called when `!abort` is true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the test suite may not be able to detect a bug in the `abort` function, which is only called when `abort` is a non-truthy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the test suite may not be able to detect a bug in the `abort` function, which is only called when `abort` is a truthy value.

DONE.
