  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > b
```
This would result in different behavior because the operator is flipped, causing the function to return the opposite result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === b
```
This would result in different behavior because the operator is changed to check for equality, causing the function to return a different result if the values are not equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== b
```
This would result in different behavior because the operator is changed to check for inequality, causing the function to return a different result if the values are not equal.

DONE.
