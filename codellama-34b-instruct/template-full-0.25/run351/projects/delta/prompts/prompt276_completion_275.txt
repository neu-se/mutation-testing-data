  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const length = Math.min(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength());
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.min` function would not be called with the correct arguments, leading to an incorrect calculation of the minimum length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const length = thisIter.peekLength() - otherIter.peekLength();
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculation of the minimum length would be incorrect, leading to an incorrect transformation of the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const length = otherIter.peekLength() - thisIter.peekLength();
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculation of the minimum length would be incorrect, leading to an incorrect transformation of the delta.

DONE.
