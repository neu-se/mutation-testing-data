  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method advances the iterator to the next index, which would cause the loop to skip over the current iteration's values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.hasNext
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasNext` method checks if there is a next value in the iterator, but it does not advance the iterator, which would cause the loop to loop indefinitely on the current iteration's values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.previous()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `previous` method moves the iterator back one index, which would cause the loop to go back to the previous iteration's values.

DONE.
