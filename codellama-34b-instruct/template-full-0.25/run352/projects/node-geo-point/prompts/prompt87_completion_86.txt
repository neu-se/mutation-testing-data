  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ2 = sinφ1⋅cosδ + cosφ1⋅sinδ⋅cosθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `sin` function, which returns the sine of an angle in radians, while the new code fragment uses the `sinφ1` variable, which is not defined in the context of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosφ2 = cosφ1⋅cosδ - sinφ1⋅sinδ⋅cosθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `cos` function, which returns the cosine of an angle in radians, while the new code fragment uses the `cosφ1` variable, which is not defined in the context of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tanΔλ = sinθ⋅sinδ⋅cosφ1 / cosδ−sinφ1⋅sinφ2
```
This would result in different behavior because the
