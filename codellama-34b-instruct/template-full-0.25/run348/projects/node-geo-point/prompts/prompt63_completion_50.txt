  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the latitude of the first point instead of the second point, which could lead to incorrect calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the latitude of the second point, which could lead to incorrect calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the latitude of the second point, which could lead to incorrect calculations.

DONE.
