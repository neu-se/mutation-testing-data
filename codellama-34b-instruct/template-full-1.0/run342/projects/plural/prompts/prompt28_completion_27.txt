  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the - 2 would not be applied, so the result would be one character shorter than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, w.length + 4
```
This would result in different behavior because the + 4 would make the substring start 4 characters earlier than expected, leading to a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1, w.length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the - 2 would not be applied, so the result would be one character shorter than expected.

DONE.
