  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking the index of the next element instead of the current element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking the index of the first element instead of the current element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking the index of the previous element instead of the current element.

DONE.
