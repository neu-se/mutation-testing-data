Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for a false value instead of true, which would cause the code to incorrectly call `nextStream()` when it should not, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the stream processing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `err` is not null instead of specifically checking if it is true, which could lead to the `nextStream()` function being called for any non-null error, regardless of its actual value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err === 'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `err` is a string with the value 'error', which is a very specific condition that would not be met for most error objects, thus preventing the call to `nextStream()` when it should be invoked for actual error conditions.

DONE.
