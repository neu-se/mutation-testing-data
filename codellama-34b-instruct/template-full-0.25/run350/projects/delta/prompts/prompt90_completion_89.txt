  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.retain === 'number' &&
          typeof lastOp.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator would return different values for `newOp.retain` and `lastOp.retain`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `newOp.retain` and `lastOp.retain` have the same value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.retain === 'string' &&
          typeof lastOp.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator would return different values for `newOp.retain` and `lastOp.retain`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `newOp.retain` and `lastOp.retain` have the same value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
