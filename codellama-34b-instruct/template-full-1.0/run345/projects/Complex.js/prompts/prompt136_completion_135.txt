  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` checks for Not a Number, whereas `isInfinite` checks for Infinity.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isZero` checks for zero, whereas `isInfinite` checks for Infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['abs']
```
This would result in different behavior because `abs` returns the absolute value of the number, whereas `isInfinite` checks for Infinity.

DONE.
