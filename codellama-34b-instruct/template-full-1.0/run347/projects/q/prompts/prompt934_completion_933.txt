  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is a function that creates a new deferred object, which is not the same as `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, args.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.length` is the number of elements in the `args` array, which is different from `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, []
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not the same as `undefined`, and the empty array `[]` is not the same as the `args` array.

DONE.
