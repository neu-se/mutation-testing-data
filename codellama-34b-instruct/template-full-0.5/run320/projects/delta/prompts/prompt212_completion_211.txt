  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would execute the `if` block if `other.ops.length` is greater than 0, but the replaced code would execute the `if` block if `other.ops.length` is less than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would execute the `if` block if `other.ops.length` is greater than 0, but the replaced code would execute the `if` block if `other.ops.length` is equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would execute the `if` block if `other.ops.length` is greater than 0, but the replaced code would execute the `if` block if `other.
