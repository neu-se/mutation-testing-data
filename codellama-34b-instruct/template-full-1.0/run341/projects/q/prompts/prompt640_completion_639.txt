  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).startDispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `startDispatch` is a method that starts a dispatch process, whereas `dispatch` is a method that waits for a dispatch process to complete. Using `startDispatch` instead of `dispatch` would cause the code to run asynchronously, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or race conditions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).thenDispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `thenDispatch` is a method that waits for a dispatch process to complete, whereas `dispatch` is a method that starts a dispatch process. Using `thenDispatch` instead of `dispatch` would cause the code to run synchronously, potentially leading to slower performance or deadlocks.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).registerDispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `registerDispatch` is a method that registers a dispatch process, whereas `dispatch` is a method that starts a dispatch process
