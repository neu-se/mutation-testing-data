  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain - firstLeft >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the greater-than operator, which would evaluate to `true` if the difference is greater than or equal to 0, while the replaced code fragment uses the greater-than-or-equal-to operator, which would evaluate to `true` if the difference is greater than or equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain - firstLeft !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the greater-than operator, which would evaluate to `true` if the difference is greater than 0, while the replaced code fragment uses the not-equal-to operator, which would evaluate to `true` if the difference is not equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain - firstLeft > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code
