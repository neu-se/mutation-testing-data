  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("get", [key, value])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only passes the `key` argument to the `get` method, but this modified code passes both `key` and `value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("set", [key])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes both `key` and `value` arguments to the `set` method, but this modified code only passes `key`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("delete", [key, value])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only passes the `key` argument to the `delete` method, but this modified code passes both `key` and `value`.

DONE.
