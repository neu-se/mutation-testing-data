  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment did not throw an error, but instead returned a promise that was rejected with the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject("error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment did not return a promise that was rejected with the error, but instead threw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(new Error("error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment did not return a promise that was rejected with a new Error object, but instead threw an error.

DONE.
