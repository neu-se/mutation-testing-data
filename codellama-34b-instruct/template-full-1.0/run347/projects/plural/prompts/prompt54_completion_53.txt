  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/es$/, "s")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the "es" ending from words that were supposed to keep it, resulting in incorrect plural forms for those words.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substring(0, w.length - 2) + "i"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an "i" to the end of words that were supposed to add "es" instead, resulting in incorrect plural forms for those words.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/ves$/, "vesi")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the "ves" ending with "vesi", resulting in incorrect plural forms for those words.

DONE.
