  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Q` is a function, but `undefined` is not a function and will cause an error if called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Q` is a function, but `null` is not a function and will cause an error if called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Q` is a function, but `0` is not a function and will cause an error if called.

DONE.
