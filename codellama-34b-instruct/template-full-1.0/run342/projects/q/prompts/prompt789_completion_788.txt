  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(null,rejected);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with a 
rejection reason of `undefined`, whereas the original code would reject it with the
rejection reason passed as the second parameter to `fail()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(rejected,null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would fulfill the promise with the
same value passed to `fail()`, whereas the original code would reject it with that value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(null,null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with a
rejection reason of `undefined`, whereas the original code would reject it with the
rejection reason passed as the second parameter to `fail()`.

DONE.
