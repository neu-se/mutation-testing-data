  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i++)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback function with the `end` argument, while this new code fragment also passes the `i` variable as a second argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, max)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback function with the `end` argument, while this new code fragment also passes the `max` variable as a second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback function with the `end` argument, while this new code fragment also passes the `i + 1` expression as a second argument.

DONE.
