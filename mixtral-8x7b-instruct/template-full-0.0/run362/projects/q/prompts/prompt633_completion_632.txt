 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
["remove", key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `remove` method does not exist in the `Promise` prototype, and it would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
["delete", "key"]
