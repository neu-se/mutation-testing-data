  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, even if `z` is not infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, even if `z` is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']() || z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` if `z` is either infinite or zero, whereas the original code only checks if `z` is infinite.

DONE.
