  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.chop(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `chop` method is not called with the correct number of arguments, leading to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.chop(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `chop` method is called with a non-numeric argument, leading to a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.chop(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `chop` method is called with a negative number, leading to an infinite loop.

DONE.
