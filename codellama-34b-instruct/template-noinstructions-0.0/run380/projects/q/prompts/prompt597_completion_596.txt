  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("get", [key])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `get` method on the `object` instead of the `dispatch` method, which would return a promise for the property value instead of a promise for the result of the operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("set", [key, value])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `set` method on the `object` instead of the `dispatch` method, which would set the property value instead of invoking the operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("delete", [key])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `delete` method on the `object` instead of the `dispatch` method, which would delete the property instead of invoking the operation.

DONE.
