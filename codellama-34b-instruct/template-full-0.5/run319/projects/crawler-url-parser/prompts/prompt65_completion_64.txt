  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.hostname
```
This would result in different behavior because `ret.hostname` would return the hostname of the URL, without the subdomain, whereas `ret.host` returns the hostname with the subdomain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because `ret.pathname` would return the pathname of the URL, without the query string or fragment, whereas `ret.host` returns the hostname with the subdomain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because `ret.protocol` would return the protocol of the URL, whereas `ret.host` returns the hostname with the subdomain.

DONE.
