  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `concat` method to push the first operation from `other` onto `delta` even if `other` has no operations, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `concat` method to push the first operation from `other` onto `delta` only if `other` has no operations, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `concat` method to push the first operation from `other` onto `delta` only if `other` has more than one operation, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
