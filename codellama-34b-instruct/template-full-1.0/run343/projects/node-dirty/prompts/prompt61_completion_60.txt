  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(() => this._writeStream.destroy());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the write stream to end and destroy the read stream, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.close();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the read stream to close, which would not ensure that all data has been read from the file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy(true);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the write stream to be destroyed immediately, which could result in data loss.

DONE.
