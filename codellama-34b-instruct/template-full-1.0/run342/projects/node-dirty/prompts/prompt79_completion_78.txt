  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects the event to be an error event, but the new code would emit an empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects the event to be an error event, but the new code would emit an event called 'foo'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects the event to be an error event, but the new code would emit an event called undefined.

DONE.
