  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function would return `[undefined, 0]` instead of `[attempt3[1], attempt3[2]]`, which would cause the `isInternalFrame` function to return `false` for all stack lines, even if they contain the `@` symbol.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function would return `[undefined, null]` instead of `[attempt3[1], attempt3[2]]`, which would cause the `isInternalFrame` function to return `false` for all stack lines, even if they contain the `@` symbol.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function would return `[undefined, NaN]` instead of `[attempt3[1], attempt3[2]]`, which would cause the `is
