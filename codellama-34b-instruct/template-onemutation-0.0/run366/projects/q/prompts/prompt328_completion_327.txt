  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `promise` is a promise object that may be in a pending, fulfilled, or rejected state. Using `promise.reject` instead of `promise` would cause the `promiseDispatch` function to always return a rejected promise, which would result in different behavior in the `then` method.

DONE.
