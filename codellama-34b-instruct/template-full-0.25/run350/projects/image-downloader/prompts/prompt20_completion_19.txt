  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isRelative
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.isRelative` checks if the path is relative, whereas `path.isAbsolute` checks if the path is absolute. If the path is relative, the code would not reject the promise as expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isAbsolute(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.isAbsolute(options.dest)` checks if the destination path is absolute, whereas `path.isAbsolute` checks if the path is absolute. If the destination path is absolute, the code would not reject the promise as expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isAbsolute(options.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.isAbsolute(options.url)` checks if the URL is absolute, whereas `path.isAbsolute` checks if the path is absolute. If the URL is absolute, the code would
