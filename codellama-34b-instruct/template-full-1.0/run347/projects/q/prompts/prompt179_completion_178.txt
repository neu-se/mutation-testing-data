  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.lastIndexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of searching the string from the beginning, it will search it from the end.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.charAt
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the character at the specified index instead of the substring.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.substr
```
This would result in different behavior because it would extract a substring of the given length from the specified index instead of searching for a substring.

DONE.
