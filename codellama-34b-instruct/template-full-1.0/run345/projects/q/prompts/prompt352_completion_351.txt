  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value passed to the `then` method instead of rejecting the promise with the `exception`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with the `exception` instead of returning the value passed to the `then` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with the `exception` instead of returning the value passed to the `then` method.

DONE.
