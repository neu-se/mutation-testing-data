  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 ** zoom
```
This code fragment uses the exponentiation operator (`**`) instead of the multiplication operator (`*`) to calculate the tile size. This change can cause the `toTile` function to return incorrect tile coordinates, which can lead to errors in the application.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * zoom + 1
```
This code fragment adds 1 to the result of the multiplication, which can cause the `toTile` function to return incorrect tile coordinates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (zoom + 1)
```
This code fragment adds 1 to the `zoom` value before multiplying it by 2, which can cause the `toTile` function to return incorrect tile coordinates.

DONE.
