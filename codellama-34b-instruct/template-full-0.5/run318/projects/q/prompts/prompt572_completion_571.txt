  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` keyword refers to the global object in non-strict mode, whereas `null` would refer to the `null` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` keyword refers to the global object in non-strict mode, whereas `undefined` would refer to the `undefined` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` keyword refers to the global object in non-strict mode, whereas `{}` would refer to a new object.

DONE.
