  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `country` variable is null, whereas the original code fragment would check if the `country` variable is falsy (i.e., null, undefined, 0, false, NaN, or an empty string).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof country === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `country` variable is undefined, whereas the original code fragment would check if the `country` variable is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `country` variable has a length of 0, whereas the original code fragment would check if the `country` variable is falsy.

DONE.
