  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the `verb` property was truthy, but the replaced code fragment would always evaluate to true since it's a non-empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!verb
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the `verb` property was truthy, but the replaced code fragment would always evaluate to false since it's the negation of the `verb` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the `verb` property was truthy, but the replaced code fragment would always evaluate to a string, which is truthy, but the string may not be the same as the original `verb` property.

DONE.
