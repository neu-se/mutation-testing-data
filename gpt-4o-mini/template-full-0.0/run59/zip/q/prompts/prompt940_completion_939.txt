Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[arguments[0]]
```
This would result in different behavior because it only takes the first argument instead of all arguments, which would lead to incorrect behavior when multiple arguments are passed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.from(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.from` creates a new array from the `arguments` object, but it may not handle the `arguments` object in the same way as `array_slice`, potentially leading to unexpected results if `array_slice` has specific handling for the arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length > 0 ? [arguments[1]] : []
```
This would result in different behavior because it only includes the second argument if it exists, and returns an empty array if no arguments are provided, which would not match the original intent of capturing all arguments.

DONE.
