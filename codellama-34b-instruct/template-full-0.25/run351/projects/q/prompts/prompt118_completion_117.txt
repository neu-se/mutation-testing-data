  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp, value, index, self.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property is not defined for the `thisp` object, which would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp, value, index, self.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because the `prototype` property is not defined for the `thisp` object, which would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp, value, index, self.constructor
```
This would result in different behavior because the `constructor` property is not defined for the `thisp` object, which would cause an error.

DONE.
