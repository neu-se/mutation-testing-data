  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeify` function would return `null` instead of the expected result, which would cause the promise chain to resolve with `null` instead of the actual result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeify` function would return `undefined` instead of the expected result, which would cause the promise chain to resolve with `undefined` instead of the actual result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeify` function would return `0` instead of the expected result, which would cause the promise chain to resolve with `0` instead of the actual result.

DONE.
