  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns an array of all the arguments passed to the function, while the new code fragment returns an empty array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns an array of all the arguments passed to the function, while the new code fragment returns the first argument passed to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns an array of all the arguments passed to the function, while the new code fragment returns the number of arguments passed to the function.

DONE.
