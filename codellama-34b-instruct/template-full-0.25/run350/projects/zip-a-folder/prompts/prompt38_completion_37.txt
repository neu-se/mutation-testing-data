  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isGlob
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `isGlob` function, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `src` is not a glob.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isGlob` function is called twice, which could cause performance issues if the function is computationally expensive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.includes(',')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `includes` method checks if `src` contains a comma, which may not be the same as checking if `src` is a glob.

DONE.
