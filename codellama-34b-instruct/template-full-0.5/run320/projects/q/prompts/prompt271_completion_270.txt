  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListeners.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `progressListeners.length` is always truthy, so the `if` statement would always be entered, even if `resolvedPromise` is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListeners.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `progressListeners.length` is always truthy, so the `if` statement would always be entered, even if `resolvedPromise` is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise && progressListeners.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `resolvedPromise` is defined and if `progressListeners.length` is greater than 0, which is the original behavior of the code.

DONE.
