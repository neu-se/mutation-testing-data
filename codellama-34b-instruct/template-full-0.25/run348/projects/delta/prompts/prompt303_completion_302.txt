  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.next()` would return the next value in the iterator, whereas `iter.next` would return the next function in the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.next(2)` would return the next two values in the iterator, whereas `iter.next` would return the next function in the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(iter.next())
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.next(iter.next())` would return the next value in the iterator after the next value, whereas `iter.next` would return the next function in the iterator.

DONE.
