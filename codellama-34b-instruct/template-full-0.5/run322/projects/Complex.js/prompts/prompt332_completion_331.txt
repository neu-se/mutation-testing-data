  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is equal to 1, while this new code fragment checks if `b` is equal to 0. This would cause the code to take a different execution path, potentially leading to different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is equal to 1, while this new code fragment checks if `a` is equal to 0. This would cause the code to take a different execution path, potentially leading to different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is equal to 1, while this new code fragment checks if `a` is equal to `b`. This would cause the code to take a different execution path, potentially leading to different results.
