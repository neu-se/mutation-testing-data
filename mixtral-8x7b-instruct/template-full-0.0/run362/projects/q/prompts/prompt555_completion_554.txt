 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original errback function is not being called, and an empty function does not handle errors, causing potential issues to go unnoticed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
5
```
This would result in different behavior because 5 is a number, not a function, and cannot be used as a continuation. This would cause a TypeError, indicating that the error handling is attempting to use a value that is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because deferred.resolve is used to fulfill a promise, not to handle errors. This would cause any errors to be silently ignored, which could lead to unexpected behavior or bugs in the application.

DONE.
