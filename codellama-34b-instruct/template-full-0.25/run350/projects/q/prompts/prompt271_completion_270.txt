  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `promise` property of the `resolvedPromise` object, which is not defined in the code snippet provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `resolvedPromise` property of the `promise` object, which is not defined in the code snippet provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `promise` property of the `deferred` object, which is not defined in the code snippet provided.

DONE.
