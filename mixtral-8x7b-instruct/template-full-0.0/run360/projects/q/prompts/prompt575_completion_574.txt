 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Function.prototype.bind.call(continuer, continuer, "next")
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `Function.prototype.bind.call` instead of `bind`, which may have different behavior in some environments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
continuer.bind(continuer, "next", void 0)
