  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goos'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds an 's' to the end of the word, while this new code fragment only adds an 's' if the word ends in 'goose'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goosey'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only adds an 's' to the end of the word, while this new code fragment adds an 's' and an 'y' to the end of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds an 's' to the end of the word, while this new code fragment adds an 's' to the end of the word and then adds another 's' to the end of the word.

DONE.
