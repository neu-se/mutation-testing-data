  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i < length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from 0 instead of 1, which could cause the first argument to be skipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = length - 1; i >= 0; i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from the last argument instead of the first, which could cause the last argument to be skipped.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1; i <= length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one more time than the original code, which could cause an error if the last argument is not a function.

DONE.
