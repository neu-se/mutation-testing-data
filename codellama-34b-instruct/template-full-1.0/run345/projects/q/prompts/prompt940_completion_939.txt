  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments` is an object and not a function in ES5. The original code would have thrown a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[arguments]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate to `this[array_slice(arguments)]`, which is probably not what the original code intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {
    return array_slice(arguments);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is not passed to the function, so it would refer to the global `arguments` object in non-strict mode, or `undefined` in strict mode.

DONE.
