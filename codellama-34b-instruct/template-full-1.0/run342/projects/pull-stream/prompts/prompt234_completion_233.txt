  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.substr(0, 5)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check the first five characters of the data, while the original code checks the whole data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the uppercase version of the data, while the original code checks the original case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would strip out all non-alphanumeric characters, while the original code checks the original data.

DONE.
