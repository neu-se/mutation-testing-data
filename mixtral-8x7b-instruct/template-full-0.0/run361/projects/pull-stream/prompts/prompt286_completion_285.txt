 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `data` would not be assigned a new value when `end` is true, and it would always be passed to the callback function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `data` would not be assigned a new value when `end` is true, and it would always be passed to the callback function, which might cause an error if the callback is not expecting an undefined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper(data, end)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `mapper` function is being called with an additional argument, `end`, which was not present in the original code. This might cause the `mapper` function to behave differently, or throw an error if it does not expect an additional argument.

DONE.
