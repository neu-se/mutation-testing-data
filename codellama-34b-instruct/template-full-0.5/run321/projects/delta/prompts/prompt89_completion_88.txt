  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!newOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because `!newOp.attributes` will always be `false` if `newOp.attributes` is an object, since objects are truthy in JavaScript. This would cause the `if` statement to always be executed, even if `newOp.attributes` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes && typeof newOp.attributes === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `newOp.attributes` is an object and also if it is truthy. This would cause the `if` statement to be executed only if `newOp.attributes` is an object and is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.attributes === 'object' && newOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `newOp.attributes` is an object and also if it is truthy. This
