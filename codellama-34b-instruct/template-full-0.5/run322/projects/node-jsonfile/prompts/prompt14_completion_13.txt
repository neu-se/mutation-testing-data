  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!shouldThrow
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the boolean value of `shouldThrow`, so if `shouldThrow` is true, `!shouldThrow` will be false, and vice versa. This means that the `if` statement will not execute the same branch as the original code, and the behavior of the function will be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
shouldThrow && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator will evaluate to false if either operand is false, so if `shouldThrow` is true, the expression will evaluate to false, and the `if` statement will not execute the same branch as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
shouldThrow || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator will evaluate to true if either operand is true, so if `shouldThrow` is false, the expression will evaluate to true, and the
