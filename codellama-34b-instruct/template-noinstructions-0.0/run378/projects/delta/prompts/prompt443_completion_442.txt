  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `length` is used to determine the length of the substring to be returned, while `0` would always return an empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `length` is used to determine the length of the substring to be returned, while `-1` would return the entire string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `length` is used to determine the length of the substring to be returned, while `Infinity` would return an empty string.

DONE.
