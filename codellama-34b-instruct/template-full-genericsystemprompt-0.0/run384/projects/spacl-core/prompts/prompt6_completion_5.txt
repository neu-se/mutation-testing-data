  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\//
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches the beginning of the string, while the new code fragment matches the beginning of the string and the end of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any character except for the forward slash, while the new code fragment matches any character except for the forward slash and the end of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any character except for the forward slash, while the new code fragment matches any character except for the forward slash and the end of the string.

DONE.
