  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a single variable, while `data[key]` is a property accessor that returns a value from an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.key
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a single variable, while `data.key` is a property accessor that returns a value from an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.key[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a single variable, while `data.key[0]` is a property accessor that returns a value from an object, and then accesses the first element of that value.

DONE.
