  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return cb(null, i++)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` would always return the value of `cb` regardless of the value of `i`, while the proposed change would return the value of `cb` only if `i++` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return i < max ? cb(null, i++) : cb(null, i--)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not handle the case where `i` is greater than `max`, while the proposed change would return the value of `i--` if `i` is greater than `max`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return cb(null, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `return` statement uses postfix increment, while the proposed change uses prefix increment.

DONE.
