  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.push(iter.next(index));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the next operation in the iterator to the line, rather than the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.push(iter.next(index + 1));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the next operation in the iterator to the line, rather than the current operation, and it would also skip the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.push(iter.next(index - 1));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the previous operation in the iterator to the line, rather than the current operation.

DONE.
