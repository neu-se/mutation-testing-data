  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would no longer be able to be iterated over.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
``` null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would no longer be treated as a placeholder.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
``` string
```
This would result in different behavior because it would no longer be treated as a placeholder.

DONE.
