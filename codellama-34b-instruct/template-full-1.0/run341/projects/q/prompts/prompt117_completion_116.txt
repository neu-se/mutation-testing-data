  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` always returns a random number between 0 and 1, whereas `self` in the original code refers to the current object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that represents the absence of any object value, whereas `self` in the original code refers to the current object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that represents an uninitialized or non-existent variable, whereas `self` in the original code refers to the current object.

DONE.
