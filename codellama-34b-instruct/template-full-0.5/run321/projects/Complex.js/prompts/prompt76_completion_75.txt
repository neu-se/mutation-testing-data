  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= tokens.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute one additional time, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute, as the condition would never be met.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only execute once, and the variable `c` would be assigned the value of the first element in the `tokens` array, rather than the second element as intended.

DONE.
