  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['abs'](this['re'] + this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the absolute value of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, rather than just the real part, which is what the original code fragment does.

DONE.
