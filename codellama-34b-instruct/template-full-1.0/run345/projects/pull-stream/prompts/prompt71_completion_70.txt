  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `op` is a function that takes `data` as an argument, and `op(data)` would execute the function with `data` as its argument, potentially returning a different value than `op`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op(data, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `op` is a function that takes multiple arguments, and `op(data, data)` would execute the function with `data` as its first and second arguments, potentially returning a different value than `op(data)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
drain(data, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `drain` is a function that takes multiple arguments, and `drain(data, data)` would execute the function with `data` as its first and second arguments, potentially returning a different value than `drain(data)`.

DONE.
