  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_without_last_part.startsWith(pageurl_without_last_part)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `startsWith` method returns `true` if the first argument is a substring of the second argument, while the `==` operator returns `true` if the two arguments are equal. In this case, the `startsWith` method would return `true` if the `linkurl_without_last_part` starts with the `pageurl_without_last_part`, while the `==` operator would return `true` if the two arguments are equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_without_last_part.endsWith(pageurl_without_last_part)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `endsWith` method returns `true` if the first argument is a substring of the second argument, while the `==` operator returns `true` if the two arguments are equal. In this case, the `endsWith` method would return `
