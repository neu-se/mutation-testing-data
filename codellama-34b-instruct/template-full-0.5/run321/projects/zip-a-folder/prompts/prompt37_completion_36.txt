  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isGlob(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator inverts the result of the `isGlob` function, so if `src` is a glob, it would return `false`, and if `src` is not a glob, it would return `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(src) && src.includes(',')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `true` if `src` is a glob and it includes a comma.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(src) || src.includes('*')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` if `src` is a glob or if it includes an asterisk.

DONE.
