Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it retrieves the next operation instead of just peeking at the current one, potentially altering the flow of the composition by consuming an operation that may not have been intended to be processed yet.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the type of the next operation instead of the operation itself, which could lead to incorrect handling of the operations based on their type rather than their actual values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the condition to always evaluate to false, leading to the code block that processes the operations to be skipped entirely, which would disrupt the expected composition logic.

DONE.
