  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method would be called with an additional argument, which would cause an error in the `nodeArgs.push` line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(deferred.promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method would be called with a different argument, which would cause the `nodeArgs.push` line to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(deferred);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method would be called with a different argument, which would cause the `nodeArgs.push` line to behave differently.

DONE.
