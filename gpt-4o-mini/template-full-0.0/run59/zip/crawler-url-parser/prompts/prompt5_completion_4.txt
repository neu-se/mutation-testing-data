Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.length < 5
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the length of `currentUrlStr` is less than 5 instead of checking for illegal characters, potentially allowing invalid URLs to pass through.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!_has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the check for illegal characters, allowing URLs with illegal characters to be processed instead of rejecting them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.includes(' ')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `currentUrlStr` contains a space character, which is not a comprehensive check for illegal characters, potentially allowing other invalid URLs to be accepted.

DONE.
