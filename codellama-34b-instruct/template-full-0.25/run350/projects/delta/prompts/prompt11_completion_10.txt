  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const key in b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the key is present in the `b` object instead of the `a` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const key in a && key in b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the key is present in both the `a` and `b` objects, whereas the original code only checks if the key is present in `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const key in a || key in b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the key is present in either the `a` or `b` objects, whereas the original code only checks if the key is present in `a`.

DONE.
