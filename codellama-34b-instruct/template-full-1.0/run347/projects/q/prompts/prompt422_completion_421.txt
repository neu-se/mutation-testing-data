  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!object
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `object` is a variable or property, and `!object` would negate the value of that variable or property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `object` could be any truthy value, but `false` is a constant value that would always make the conditional statement evaluate to false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.foo
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `object` is not a valid reference, and `object.foo` would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
