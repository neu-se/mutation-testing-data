  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method with a length argument would return a different op than the original code, which could cause the algorithm to produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.previous(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `previous()` method would retrieve a different op than the original code, which could cause the algorithm to produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek()` method would retrieve a different op than the original code, which could cause the algorithm to produce a different result.

DONE.
