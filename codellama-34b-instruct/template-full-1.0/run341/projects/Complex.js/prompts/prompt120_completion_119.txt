  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the real parts of the two complex numbers instead of their magnitudes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] === z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the imaginary parts of the two complex numbers instead of their magnitudes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] <=> z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the imaginary parts of the two complex numbers using the PHP spaceship operator instead of comparing their magnitudes.

DONE.
