  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekLength()` returns the length of the next operation in the `other` iterator, while `<PLACEHOLDER>` returns the length of the current operation in the `this` iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.peekLength()` returns the length of the next operation in the `this` iterator, while `<PLACEHOLDER>` returns the length of the current operation in the `other` iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the length of the next operation in both iterators, while `<PLACEHOLDER>` only adds the length of the current operation in the `this` iterator.

DONE.
