 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.rest()
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `thisIter` instead of the `otherIter`. This change would cause the `Delta` object to be constructed using the remaining operations in the current delta, rather than the other delta, potentially leading to incorrect results when composing deltas.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
iter.rest()
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `iter` instead of the `otherIter`. This change would cause the `Delta` object to be constructed using the remaining operations in the original delta, rather than the other delta, potentially leading to incorrect results when composing deltas.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Delta([])
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new, empty `Delta` object instead of using the remaining operations from the `otherIter`. This change would cause the `Delta` object to be constructed without
