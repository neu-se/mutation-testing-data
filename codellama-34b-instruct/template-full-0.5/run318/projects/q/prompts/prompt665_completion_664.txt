  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` would return an empty array instead of an array with the arguments passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` would return an array with a single element, `null`, instead of an array with the arguments passed to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` would return an array with a single element, `undefined`, instead of an array with the arguments passed to the function.

DONE.
