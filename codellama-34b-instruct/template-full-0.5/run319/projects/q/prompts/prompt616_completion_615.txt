  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.promiseDispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `promiseDispatch` is a different method than `dispatch`, and it may have different behavior or arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a bound context, which may change the behavior of `dispatch` when it is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.apply(this, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments, which may change the behavior of `dispatch` when it is called.

DONE.
