  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `key` to be a string, but `undefined` will cause the code to throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `key` to be a truthy value, but `null` is falsy, so the code will not execute the `if` block.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"key"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `key` to be a variable, but `"key"` is a string literal, so the code will not execute the `delete` method on `this._data`.

DONE.
