 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a distance of 0, regardless of the input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
r + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a distance greater than or equal to 2, even for small input distances.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a random value between 0 and 1, instead of the actual distance calculation.

DONE.
