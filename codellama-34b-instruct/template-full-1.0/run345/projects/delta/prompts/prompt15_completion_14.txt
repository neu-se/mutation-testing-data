  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compose` function checks if the `a` argument is an object, and if it is not, it sets it to an empty object using `cloneDeep()`. If we replace the `typeof` operator with `===`, the function would always return an empty object, regardless of the type of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compose` function checks if the `a` argument is an object. If we replace the `typeof` operator with `!== null`, the function would return an empty object if `a` is not null, while it would return `undefined` if `a` is null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compose` function checks if the `a` argument is an object. If we replace the `typeof` operator
