  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!op
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `op`, so if `op` is truthy, the negated value would be falsy, and vice versa. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to a different branch, potentially leading to different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator adds 1 to the value of `op`, which could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to a different branch.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator multiplies the value of `op` by 2, which could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to a different branch.

DONE.
