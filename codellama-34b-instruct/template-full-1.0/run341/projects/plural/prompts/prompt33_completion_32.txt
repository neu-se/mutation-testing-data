  Sure, here are three plausible options for the mutation test:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ses'
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring method is not called with the correct start and end indices. The starting index is now 0 instead of 1, and the end index is 2 less than the original end index. This would cause the resulting string to be 2 characters shorter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substr(0, w.length - 3) + 'yes'
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring method is not called with the correct start and end indices. The starting index is now 0 instead of 1, and the end index is now three less than the original end index. This would cause the resulting string to be three characters shorter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substr(1, w.length - 2) +
