  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_filter` returns a new array with only the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, while `array_map` returns a new array with the results of calling the provided function on every element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_reduce
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_reduce` returns a single value that is the result of combining all the elements of the array using the provided function, while `array_map` returns a new array with the results of calling the provided function on every element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_forEach
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_forEach` returns undefined and only calls the provided function on every element, while `array_map` returns a new array with the results of calling the provided function on every element.

DONE.
