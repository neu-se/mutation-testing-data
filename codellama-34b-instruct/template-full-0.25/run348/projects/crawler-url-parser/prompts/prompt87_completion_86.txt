  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the trimmed text content of the element, whereas the original code fragment would return the trimmed text content of the element and its descendants.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().toLowerCase();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the lowercase text content of the element, whereas the original code fragment would return the trimmed text content of the element and its descendants.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().split(" ").join("");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the text content of the element with all spaces removed, whereas the original code fragment would return the trimmed text content of the element and its descendants.

DONE.
