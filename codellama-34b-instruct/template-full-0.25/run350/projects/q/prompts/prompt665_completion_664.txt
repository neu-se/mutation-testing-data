  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 1)` would return an array of the arguments starting from the second argument, while `arguments` would return the arguments object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 2)` would return an array of the arguments starting from the third argument, while `arguments` would return the arguments object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 3)` would return an array of the arguments starting from the fourth argument, while `arguments` would return the arguments object.

DONE.
