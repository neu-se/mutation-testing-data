Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
file &&!file.sourceMap && line
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the absence of a source map instead of its presence, which would lead to incorrect handling of files with source maps.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
file && file.sourceMap &&!line
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the absence of a line number instead of its presence, which would lead to incorrect handling of files with line numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
file && file.sourceMap && column
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the presence of a column number instead of a line number, which would lead to incorrect handling of files with line numbers but without column numbers.

DONE.
