  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because `keys()` returns an iterator over the keys in the map, while `values()` returns an iterator over the values in the map. In the context of the code, the `for` loop expects an iterator over the values in the map, so replacing `values()` with `keys()` would cause the loop to iterate over the keys instead of the values, leading to different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.entries()
```
This would result in different behavior because `entries()` returns an iterator over the key-value pairs in the map, while `values()` returns an iterator over the values in the map. In the context of the code, the `for` loop expects an iterator over the values in the map, so replacing `values()` with `entries()` would cause the loop to iterate over the key-value pairs instead of the values, leading to different behavior.
