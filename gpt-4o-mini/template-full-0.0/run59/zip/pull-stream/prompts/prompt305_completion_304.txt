Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the `ended` variable, which could lead to the callback being called with a false value when it should be true, potentially causing the function to behave incorrectly when determining if the reading has ended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes `null` as the first argument to the callback instead of the `ended` variable, which may lead to incorrect handling of the end state and could cause the consumer of this function to misinterpret the end of the reading process.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because it always indicates that the reading has ended by passing `true`, regardless of the actual state of the `ended` variable, which could prematurely terminate the reading process and prevent further data from being processed.

DONE.
