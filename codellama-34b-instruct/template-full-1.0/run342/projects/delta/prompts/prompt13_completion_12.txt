  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of the values of the object, whereas `Object.keys` returns an array of the keys of the object. Accessing the `length` property of this array would give a different result than the original code, which expected the number of keys in the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries` returns an array of the key-value pairs of the object, whereas `Object.keys` returns an array of the keys of the object. Accessing the `length` property of this array would give a different result than the original code, which expected the number of keys in the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.getOwnPropertyNames.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.getOwnPropertyNames` returns an array of the own property names
