  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute, as the condition `key in object` would always be false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key = "key";
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only execute once, as the condition `key in object` would be true only for the property named "key".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key = Math.random();
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute with a random property name each time, and the behavior would depend on the specific property names in the object.

DONE.
