 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'dummy'
```
This would result in different behavior because the destination path would be set to the string 'dummy' instead of the decoded basename of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the destination path would be set to a random number instead of the decoded basename of the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url
```
This would result in different behavior because the destination path would be set to the URL of the image instead of the decoded basename of the URL.

DONE.
