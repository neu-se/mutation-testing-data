 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array is returned instead of a promise, causing the `allSettled` function to always return immediately with an empty array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
promises.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of the `promises` array, so any further modifications to the original `promises` array will not affect the execution of the `allSettled` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.values(promises)
```
This would result in different behavior because if the `promises` argument is an object with numeric keys, it would convert it into an array of values, potentially changing the order of the promises and affecting the behavior of the `allSettled` function.

DONE.
