  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite` checks if the complex number is infinite, while `isZero` checks if it is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === 0 && this['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the real and imaginary parts of the complex number are both zero, which is a different condition than `isZero`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the complex number is not zero, which is the opposite condition of `isZero`.

DONE.
