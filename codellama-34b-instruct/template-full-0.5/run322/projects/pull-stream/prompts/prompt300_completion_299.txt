  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `ended` checks if the stream has ended, while the new code fragment `!ended` checks if the stream has not ended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `ended` checks if the stream has ended, while the new code fragment `true` always evaluates to true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `ended` checks if the stream has ended, while the new code fragment `false` always evaluates to false.

DONE.
