  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.slice()` creates a shallow copy of the `array`, whereas `array` itself is a reference to the original array. If the `array` is mutated after the `spread` method is called, the shallow copy created by `array.slice()` would not reflect those changes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.concat()` creates a new array that is a concatenation of the `array` and any additional arguments passed to it. This would result in a different array than the original `array`, even if the `array` is not mutated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.map(function(x) { return x; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.map()` creates a new array by applying the provided function to each element of the `array`. This would result in
