  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `deferred.resolve` would cause the promise to be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.dispatch("reject", [])
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.dispatch("reject", [])` would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `deferred.resolve` would cause the promise to be resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.dispatch("fail", [])
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.dispatch("fail", [])` would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `deferred.resolve` would cause the promise to be resolved.

DONE.
