  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self, args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first argument of the `args` array, instead of all the arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self, args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass all the arguments except the first one, instead of all the arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self, args.concat(self)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass all the arguments and also the `self` object, instead of just the arguments.

DONE.
