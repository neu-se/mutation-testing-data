  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method would return an empty array, instead of an array with the remaining elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method would return an array with the last element removed, instead of an array with the remaining elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1.5
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method would return an array with the first element removed, and the remaining elements would be rounded to the nearest integer.

DONE.
