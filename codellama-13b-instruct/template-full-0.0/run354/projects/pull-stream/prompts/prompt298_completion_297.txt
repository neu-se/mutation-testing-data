  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback function with the `ended` parameter, while this code fragment calls it with both `null` and `data`. This could cause the test to fail if the test is expecting only one parameter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(ended)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback function with the `ended` parameter, while this code fragment calls it with only the `ended` parameter. This could cause the test to fail if the test is expecting both parameters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data, ended)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback function with two parameters, while this code fragment calls it with three parameters. This could cause the test to fail if the test is expecting only two parameters.

DONE.
