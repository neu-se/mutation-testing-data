  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getHandler` method is not defined in the `Delta` class, and therefore would result in a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.prototype.getHandler
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getHandler` method is defined on the `Delta` prototype, and therefore would result in a different behavior when the `getHandler` method is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method is used to bind the `getHandler` method to the `this` context, which would result in a different behavior when the `getHandler` method is called.

DONE.
