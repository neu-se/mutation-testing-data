Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only allow tracking of unhandled rejections if `trackUnhandledRejections` is explicitly set to `false`, which is the opposite of the original condition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow tracking of unhandled rejections when `trackUnhandledRejections` is anything other than `true`, which could lead to incorrect handling of promise rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!trackUnhandledRejections && false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false`, preventing any tracking of unhandled rejections regardless of the state of `trackUnhandledRejections`.

DONE.
