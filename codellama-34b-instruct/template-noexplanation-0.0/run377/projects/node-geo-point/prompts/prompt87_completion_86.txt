  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ2 = sinφ1 * cosδ + cosφ1 * sinδ * cosθ;
```
This code fragment is a correct implementation of the Haversine formula, which is used to calculate the distance between two points on a sphere. The original code fragment had a typo, which caused the formula to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ2 = sinφ1 * cosδ + cosφ1 * sinδ * cosθ + 1;
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code fragment, but it adds a constant term to the formula. This term will cause the formula to produce incorrect results, which can be used to test the robustness of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ2 = sinφ1 * cosδ + cosφ1 * sinδ * cosθ + 1 / (1 + sinφ1 * sinφ2);
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code fragment, but it
