  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount--
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pendingCount` variable would be decremented after each promise is resolved, rather than before. This could cause the `deferred.resolve(promises)` function to be called too early, resulting in a promise that is resolved with an array of promises that are not yet resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount++
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pendingCount` variable would be incremented after each promise is resolved, rather than before. This could cause the `deferred.resolve(promises)` function to be called too late, resulting in a promise that is resolved with an array of promises that are not yet resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pendingCount` variable would be set to 0 after each promise is resolved, rather than being decremented. This could
