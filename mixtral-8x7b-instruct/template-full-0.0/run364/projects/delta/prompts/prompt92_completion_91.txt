 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index >= this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow pushing the newOp to the end of the array even when the length is equal to the current length, whereas the original condition only allows it when the length is strictly less than the current length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would never allow pushing the newOp to the end of the array, whereas the original condition allows it when the length is strictly less than the current length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index === this.ops.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only allow pushing the newOp to the end of the array when the length is one less than the current length, whereas the original condition allows it when the length is strictly less than the current length.

DONE.
