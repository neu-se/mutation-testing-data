 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `calculateDestination` method to incorrectly calculate the destination point's latitude, as it would always use the sine of the initial latitude instead of the sine of the angular distance.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `calculateDestination` method to always return a longitude of 0, regardless of the input, due to the incorrect assignment in the line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cos(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `calculateDestination` method to incorrectly calculate the destination point's latitude, as it would always use the cosine of the final latitude instead of the sine of the angular distance.

By introducing these changes, the mutated code would produce incorrect
