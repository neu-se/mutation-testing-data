  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.message
```
This would result in different behavior because `exception.message` is a string, whereas `exception` is an object. The `reject` function expects an exception object, not a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because `new Error(exception)` creates a new error object with `exception` as the message, whereas `exception` is already an error object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an error object, whereas `exception` is. The `reject` function expects an exception object.

DONE.
