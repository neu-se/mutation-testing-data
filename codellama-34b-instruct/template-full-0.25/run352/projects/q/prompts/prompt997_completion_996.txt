  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `deferred.makeNodeResolver` is a function that returns a function, while the modified code fragment `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` calls the function and returns its result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver.bind(deferred)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `deferred.makeNodeResolver` is a function that returns a function, while the modified code fragment `deferred.makeNodeResolver.bind(deferred)` returns a bound function that is bound to the `deferred` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver.call(deferred)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `deferred.makeNodeResolver` is a function that returns a function, while the modified code fragment `deferred.makeNodeResolver.call(de
