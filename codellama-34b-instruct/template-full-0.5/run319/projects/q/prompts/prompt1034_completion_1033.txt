  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
captureLine + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `captureLine` function would be called with the wrong argument, causing the stack trace to be captured incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
captureLine - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `captureLine` function would be called with the wrong argument, causing the stack trace to be captured incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
captureLine = function() { return 0; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `captureLine` function would always return 0, causing the stack trace to be captured incorrectly.

DONE.
