  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer()` is a function call, while `defer` is a variable reference.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer.promise` is a property reference, while `defer` is a variable reference.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Deferred()
```
This would result in different behavior because `new Deferred()` is a constructor call, while `defer` is a variable reference.

DONE.
