  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function would now return the `b` object instead of the `a` object, which may not have the same keys or values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function would now return the string `'a'` instead of the `a` object, which may not have the same keys or values as the original `a` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function would now return the number `1` instead of the `a` object, which may not have the same keys or values as the original `a` object.

DONE.
