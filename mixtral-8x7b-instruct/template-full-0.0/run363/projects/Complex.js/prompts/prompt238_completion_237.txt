 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-Math.abs(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the imaginary part of the result is changed, which is not consistent with the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the magnitude of the imaginary part is amplified, which is not consistent with the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sqrt(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the square root of the imaginary part is used, which is not consistent with the original code fragment.

DONE.
