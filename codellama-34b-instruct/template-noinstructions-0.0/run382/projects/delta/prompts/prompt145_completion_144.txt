  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the new operation to the end of the `ops` array, rather than the beginning.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.unshift(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the new operation to the beginning of the `ops` array, rather than the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.splice(0, 0, newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the new operation at the beginning of the `ops` array, rather than pushing it to the end.

DONE.
