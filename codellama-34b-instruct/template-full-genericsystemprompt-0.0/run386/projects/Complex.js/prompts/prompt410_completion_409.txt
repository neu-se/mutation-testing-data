  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
noIM = false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `noIM` variable is used to determine whether the imaginary part of the complex number is zero, and setting it to `false` would cause the code to execute the `else` branch, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
noIM = true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `noIM` variable is used to determine whether the imaginary part of the complex number is zero, and setting it to `true` would cause the code to execute the `if` branch, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
noIM = !noIM
```
This would result in different behavior because the `noIM` variable is used to determine whether the imaginary part of the complex number is zero, and negating its value would cause the code to execute the opposite branch, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
