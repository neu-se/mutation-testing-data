  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[^\S]ices$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ices' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression has a typo in it, and the substring method call should be removed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[^aeiouy]ices$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ices' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression has different semantics than the original code fragment, and the substring method call should be removed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[^aeiouy]ices$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'iwes' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression has different semantics than the original
