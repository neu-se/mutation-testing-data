  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close', () => this.close()
```
This would result in different behavior because the event listener for the 'close' event would be called when the write stream is closed, whereas the original code fragment listens for the 'drain' event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', () => this.close()
```
This would result in different behavior because the event listener for the 'error' event would be called when an error occurs on the write stream, whereas the original code fragment listens for the 'drain' event.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finish', () => this.close()
```
This would result in different behavior because the event listener for the 'finish' event would be called when the write stream is finished writing data, whereas the original code fragment listens for the 'drain' event.

DONE.
