  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` would reject the promise, causing all the code that depends on it to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.when
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.when` is not a defined method on the `Promise.prototype` object, and would therefore result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(Q.reject)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.then` is a defined method on the `Promise.prototype` object, but `Q.reject` would reject the promise, causing all the code that depends on it to fail.

DONE.
