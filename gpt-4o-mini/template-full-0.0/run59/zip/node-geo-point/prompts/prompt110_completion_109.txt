Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp` calculates the exponential of a number, which will yield significantly different results compared to the logarithmic function `Math.log`, potentially leading to incorrect tile coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` computes the sine of an angle, which is unrelated to the calculation of tile coordinates and will produce nonsensical results in the context of geographic calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` calculates the square root of a number, which does not correspond to the intended logarithmic transformation and will lead to incorrect calculations for the tile coordinates.

DONE.
