  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value and does not have a `concat` method, unlike `args || []`, which is an array and has a `concat` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value and does not have a `concat` method, unlike `args || []`, which is an array and has a `concat` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because `[]` is an empty array and does not have a `concat` method, unlike `args || []`, which is an array and has a `concat` method.

DONE.
