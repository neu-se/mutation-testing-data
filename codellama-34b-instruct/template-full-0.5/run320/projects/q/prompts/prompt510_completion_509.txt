  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.slice()` creates a new copy of the `args` array, while `args` by itself references the original array. If the generator function modifies the `args` array, using `args.slice()` would prevent those changes from being reflected in the `args` array that is passed to the `then` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.concat()` creates a new array that is the concatenation of the `args` array and the `args` array, while `args` by itself references the original array. If the generator function modifies the `args` array, using `args.concat()` would prevent those changes from being reflected in the `args` array that is passed to the `then` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[].concat(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because
