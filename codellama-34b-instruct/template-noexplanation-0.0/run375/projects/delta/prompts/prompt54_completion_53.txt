  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(ops) && ops.length > 0
```
This code fragment checks if `ops` is an array and has a length greater than 0, which is a more strict check than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops instanceof Array
```
This code fragment checks if `ops` is an instance of the `Array` class, which is a more explicit check than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.constructor === Array
```
This code fragment checks if the constructor of `ops` is the `Array` function, which is a more explicit check than the original code fragment.

DONE.
