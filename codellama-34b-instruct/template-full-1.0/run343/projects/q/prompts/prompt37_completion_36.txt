  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `domain` variable is always defined, so the conditional will always evaluate to `true`, even if there is no active domain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof domain !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator checks if a variable is defined, but it does not check if the variable is `null`. If `domain` is `null`, the conditional will evaluate to `true` even though there is no active domain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain !== void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `void 0` expression returns `undefined`, and it is used to check if a variable is not defined. If `domain` is `null`, the conditional will evaluate to `true` even though there is no active domain.

DONE.
