  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter.next()` method to return a value that is one more than the actual length of the next operation in the `other` Delta, which would cause the `transform` method to skip over the next operation in the `other` Delta and potentially return an incorrect result.
