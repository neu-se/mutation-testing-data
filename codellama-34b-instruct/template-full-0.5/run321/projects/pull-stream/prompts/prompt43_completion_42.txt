  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref` is an array, and `ref[0]` is the first element of the array, whereas `ref` by itself is the array itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref.length` is the number of elements in the array, whereas `ref` by itself is the array itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[ref.length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref[ref.length - 1]` is the last element of the array, whereas `ref` by itself is the array itself.

DONE.
