  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `array` is an array, and `array.length` returns the length of the array. However, `array.length - 1` would return the length of the array minus 1, which could result in a different value being returned by the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `array` is an array, and `array[0]` returns the first element of the array. However, if the array is empty, `array[0]` would return `undefined`, which could result in a different value being returned by the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `array` is an array, and `array.slice(1)` returns a new array containing all elements of the original array except
