  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\t"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the separator between stack frames to a tab character instead of a newline character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the separator between stack frames to a space character instead of a newline character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the separator between stack frames altogether, causing all stack frames to be concatenated into a single line.

DONE.
