  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.retain` is an object, but the new code fragment checks if it is a string. This could cause the `invert` method to behave differently when it encounters an object in the `ops` array.

DONE.
