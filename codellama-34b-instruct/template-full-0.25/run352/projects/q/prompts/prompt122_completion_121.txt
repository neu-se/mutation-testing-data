  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_keys` function would return an empty array instead of an array of the object's own enumerable property names.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_keys` function would return an array of the object's own enumerable property names, but the `array_map` function would not be able to iterate over the array because it is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_keys` function would return an array of the object's own enumerable property names, but the `array_map` function would not be able to iterate over the array because it is empty.

DONE.
