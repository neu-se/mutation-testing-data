  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const φ2 = <PLACEHOLDER>(coordinate.latitude);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `φ2` variable to be assigned the value of `coordinate.latitude` instead of calculating it based on the `δ` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const φ2 = <PLACEHOLDER>(coordinate.longitude);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `φ2` variable to be assigned the value of `coordinate.longitude` instead of calculating it based on the `δ` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const φ2 = <PLACEHOLDER>(-coordinate.latitude);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `φ2` variable to be assigned the negative value of `coordinate.latitude` instead of calculating it based on the `δ` value.

DONE.
