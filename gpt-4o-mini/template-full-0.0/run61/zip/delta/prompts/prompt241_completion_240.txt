Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the length of the `otherIter` instead of `thisIter`, potentially causing incorrect deletions if the lengths of the two iterators differ.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it increases the deletion length by 1, which could lead to an off-by-one error, causing one extra character to be deleted than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the deletion length to zero, effectively skipping the deletion operation entirely, which could lead to unexpected results in the delta.

DONE.
