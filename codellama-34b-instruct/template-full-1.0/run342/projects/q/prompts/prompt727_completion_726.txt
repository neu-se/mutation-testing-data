  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
--pendingCount < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pendingCount` would be decremented even if it is already zero, leading to unintended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount === promises.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pendingCount` would only be considered fullfilled if it matches the number of promises, rather than if it is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!promises.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promises` array would only be considered empty if it has no length, rather than if the `pendingCount` is zero.

DONE.
