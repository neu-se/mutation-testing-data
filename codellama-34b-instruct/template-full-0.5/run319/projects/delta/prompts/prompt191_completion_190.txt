  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = otherOp.retain;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property of `newOp` would be set to the value of `otherOp.retain`, which is not necessarily the same as the value of `thisOp.retain`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = thisOp.retain;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property of `newOp` would be set to the value of `thisOp.retain`, which is not necessarily the same as the value of `otherOp.retain`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = thisOp.retain + otherOp.retain;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property of `newOp` would be set to the sum of the values of `thisOp.retain` and `otherOp.retain
