  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ref` array is only guaranteed to have 2 elements, and accessing the 3rd element would result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ref` array is only guaranteed to have 2 elements, and accessing the `length` property would return 2, which is not the same as the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0] + ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would concatenate the two elements of the `ref` array, which is not the same as the original code fragment.

DONE.
