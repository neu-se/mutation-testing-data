  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule[0]` is a regular expression, and `rule[1]` is a string. Using `rule[0]` instead of `rule[1]` would cause the function to return the regular expression instead of the expected string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule[2]` is a function, and `rule[1]` is a string. Using `rule[2]` instead of `rule[1]` would cause the function to return the function instead of the expected string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule[3]` is a string, and `rule[1]` is a regular expression. Using `rule[3]` instead of `rule[1]` would cause the function to return the string instead of the expected regular expression.

DONE.
