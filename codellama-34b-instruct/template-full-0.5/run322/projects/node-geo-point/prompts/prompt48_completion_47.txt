  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 = deg2rad(point2.latitude) + Math.PI;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deg2rad` function would be applied to a different value, causing the `calculateBearing` function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 = deg2rad(point2.latitude) - Math.PI;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deg2rad` function would be applied to a different value, causing the `calculateBearing` function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 = deg2rad(point2.latitude) * 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deg2rad` function would be applied to a different value, causing the `calculateBearing` function to return a different value.

DONE.
