  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.baseurl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the base URL instead of the current URL, which could lead to incorrect parsing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.href
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the full URL instead of the current URL, which could lead to incorrect parsing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve(baseUrl, parsedUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the URL relative to the base URL, which could lead to incorrect parsing.

DONE.
