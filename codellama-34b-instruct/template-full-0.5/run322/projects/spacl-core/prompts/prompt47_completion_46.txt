  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/:.*/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any number of characters, including none, whereas the original code fragment would match at least one character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/:[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only match alphanumeric characters, underscores, and hyphens, whereas the original code fragment would match any character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/:.{3,}/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match at least three characters, whereas the original code fragment would match any number of characters.

DONE.
