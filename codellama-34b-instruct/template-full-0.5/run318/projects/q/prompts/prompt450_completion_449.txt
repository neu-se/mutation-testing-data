  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason && reason.stack !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `stack` property of the `reason` object is not null, rather than checking if it is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason && reason.stack !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `stack` property of the `reason` object is not undefined, rather than checking if it is null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason && reason.stack !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `stack` property of the `reason` object is not the string "undefined", rather than checking if it is null or undefined.

DONE.
