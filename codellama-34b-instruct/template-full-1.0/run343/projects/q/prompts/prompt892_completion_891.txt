  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
global
```
This would result in different behavior because `global` is a special object in Node.js that contains the global variables, and using it as a callback function would likely cause issues.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Date
```
This would result in different behavior because `Date` is a built-in function in Node.js that returns the current date and time, and using it as a callback function would likely cause issues.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math` is a built-in object in Node.js that provides mathematical functions, and using it as a callback function would likely cause issues.

DONE.
