  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("keys", [])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method is called with a different set of arguments, which could potentially change the behavior of the method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("values", [])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method is called with a different set of arguments, which could potentially change the behavior of the method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("entries", [])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method is called with a different set of arguments, which could potentially change the behavior of the method.

DONE.
