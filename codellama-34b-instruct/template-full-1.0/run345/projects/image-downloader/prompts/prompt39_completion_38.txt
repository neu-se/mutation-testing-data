  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of resolving the promise with an object containing the `filename` property, the promise is rejected with the `dest` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve('')
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of resolving the promise with an object containing the `filename` property, the promise is resolved with an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve({ filepath: dest })
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of resolving the promise with an object containing the `filename` property, the promise is resolved with an object containing the `filepath` property.

DONE.
