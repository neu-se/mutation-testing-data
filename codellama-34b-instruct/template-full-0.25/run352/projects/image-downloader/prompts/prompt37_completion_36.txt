  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
createWriteStream(dest, { flags: 'a' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flags` option is set to `a`, which means that the file is opened in append mode, rather than overwrite mode. This would cause the file to be appended to, rather than overwritten, which could result in unexpected behavior if the file already exists.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
createWriteStream(dest, { flags: 'w' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flags` option is set to `w`, which means that the file is opened in write mode, rather than overwrite mode. This would cause the file to be overwritten, rather than appended to, which could result in unexpected behavior if the file already exists.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
createWriteStream(dest, { flags: 'wx' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flags` option is set to `wx`, which
