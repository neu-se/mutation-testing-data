  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the index of the argument being passed to the `pull` function, which could potentially affect the function's output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the index of the argument being passed to the `pull` function, which could potentially affect the function's output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the value of the argument being passed to the `pull` function, which could potentially affect the function's output.

DONE.
