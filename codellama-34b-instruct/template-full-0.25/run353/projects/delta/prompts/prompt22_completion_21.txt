  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isEqual` is the negation of `isEqual`, so it would return `true` if the two values are not equal, rather than `true` if they are equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNotEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNotEqual` is a different method than `isEqual`, and it may have different behavior depending on the implementation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!==
```
This would result in different behavior because `!==` is the strict inequality operator, which checks for both value and type equality, rather than just value equality.

DONE.
