  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a && onEnd
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the logic of the `if` statement, causing the `else` branch to be taken when `a` is `true` and `onEnd` is `false`, whereas the original code would take the `then` branch in the same scenario.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!a || onEnd
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce a `not` operator, causing the truth value of the expression to be reversed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== onEnd
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `!==` operator instead of the `||` operator, which would cause a different comparison to be performed.

DONE.
