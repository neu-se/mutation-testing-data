  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first promise in the array, which could cause the `allSettled` method to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.concat(Q.reject())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra rejected promise to the end of the array, which could cause the `allSettled` method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.map(function(promise) { return Q.reject(promise.inspect()); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would map each promise to a rejected promise with the same inspection value, which could cause the `allSettled` method to return a different result.

DONE.
