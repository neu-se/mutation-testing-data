  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis.call
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method is used to invoke the `uncurryThis` function, which would cause the function to be invoked with the global object as the `this` value, rather than the `Function` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is used to invoke the `uncurryThis` function, which would cause the function to be invoked with the global object as the `this` value, rather than the `Function` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method is used to create a new function that is bound to the `uncurryThis` function, which would cause the new function to be invoked with the global object as the `this` value, rather than the `Function` object.
