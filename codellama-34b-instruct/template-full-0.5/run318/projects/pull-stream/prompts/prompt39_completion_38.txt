  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes the last element of an array, whereas `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` removes the first element of an array, whereas `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` adds an element to the end of an array, whereas `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of an array.

DONE.
