  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filterStackString.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a specific `this` value and arguments, but in this case, it would not have any effect on the subsequent code, as the function is not using `this` or any arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filterStackString.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` calls a function with a specific `this` value and arguments, but in this case, it would not have any effect on the subsequent code, as the function is not using `this` or any arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filterStackString.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` calls a function with a specific `this` value and arguments, but in this case, it would not have any effect on the subsequent code, as the function is not using `this` or any arguments.
