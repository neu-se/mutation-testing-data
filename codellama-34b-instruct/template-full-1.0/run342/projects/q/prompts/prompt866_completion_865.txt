  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is a function that would immediately reject the promise, whereas `defer` is a library that creates a new deferred object, which is used to create a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid value for a promise, whereas `defer` is a valid library that creates a new deferred object, which is used to create a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid value for a promise, whereas `defer` is a valid library that creates a new deferred object, which is used to create a promise.

DONE.
