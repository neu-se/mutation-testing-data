  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 2)])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method is not defined in the `Q` object, so it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("put", [name, array_slice(arguments, 2)])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `put` method is not defined in the `Q` object, so it would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("patch", [name, array_slice(arguments, 2)])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `patch` method is not defined in the `Q` object, so it would throw an error.

DONE.
