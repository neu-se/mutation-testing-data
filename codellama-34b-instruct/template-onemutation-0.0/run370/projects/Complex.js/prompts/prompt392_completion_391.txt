  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `b` variable, which is a complex number, and the new code fragment uses `-b`, which is the negative of the `b` variable. This change would cause the `sinh` and `cosh` functions to return different values, which could potentially cause issues in the code that uses these functions.

DONE.
