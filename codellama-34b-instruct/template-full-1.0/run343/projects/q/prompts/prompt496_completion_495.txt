  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trackRejection` function would not be called with the original `rejection` object, which could cause issues if the function relies on that object to properly handle the rejection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trackRejection` function would not be called with any argument, which could cause issues if the function relies on the presence of the `rejection` object to properly handle the rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trackRejection` function would be called with the string literal `"foo"`, which could cause issues if the function expects a specific type or structure for the `rejection` object.

DONE.
