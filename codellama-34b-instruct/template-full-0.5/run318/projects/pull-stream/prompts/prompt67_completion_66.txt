  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || end !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has lower precedence than the `&&` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(end || end) !== true`, which would always be true if `end` is truthy, regardless of whether it is equal to `true` or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && end !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `end && (end !== true)`, which would be true if `end` is truthy and not equal to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && end === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator has higher precedence than the `&&` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `end && (end === true)`, which would be true if `end` is
