  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sources.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `sources.slice(0)` creates a copy of the `sources` array, whereas `sources` alone would just refer to the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sources.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `sources.slice(1)` creates a copy of the `sources` array starting from index 1, whereas `sources` alone would just refer to the original array starting from index 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sources.splice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `sources.splice(0, 1)` removes the first element from the `sources` array, whereas `sources` alone would just refer to the original array.

DONE.
