  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, so it would throw a `TypeError` when called with `apply`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, so it would throw a `TypeError` when called with `apply`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` would refer to the global object, rather than the `Promise` instance, when the function is called with `apply`.

DONE.
