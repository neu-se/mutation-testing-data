  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to skip over the last element in the array, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate one fewer times than it should, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() * 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate twice as many times as it should, potentially leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
