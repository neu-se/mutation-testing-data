  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\t"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the line separator used in the stack trace string. Instead of using the default line separator, a tab character would be used, potentially causing issues with the parsing and formatting of the stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\r"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the line separator used in the stack trace string. Instead of using the default line separator, a carriage return character would be used, potentially causing issues with the parsing and formatting of the stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the line separator used in the stack trace string. This could potentially cause issues with the parsing and formatting of the stack trace, particularly if there are multiple lines in the stack trace.

DONE.
