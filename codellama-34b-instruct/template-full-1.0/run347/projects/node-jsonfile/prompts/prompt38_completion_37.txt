  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFile)
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromCallback` returns a function that takes a callback as its first argument, while `fs.writeFile` takes a buffer or string as its first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFileSync)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFileSync` is synchronous, while `universalify.fromCallback` is asynchronous.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFileAsync)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFileAsync` is an imaginary function and does not exist in the original code.

DONE.
