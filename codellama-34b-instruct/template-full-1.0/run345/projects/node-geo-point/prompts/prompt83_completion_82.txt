  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would swap the latitude and longitude values, leading to incorrect geographic coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1 + φ2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the sum of the latitudes, leading to incorrect geographic coordinates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(sinφ1, cosφ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the inverse tangent function to calculate the correct value of φ2 given φ1.

DONE.
