  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x !== y
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality, while this replacement checks for inequality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + y
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality, while this replacement adds the values of `x` and `y`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x - y
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality, while this replacement subtracts the value of `y` from `x`.

DONE.
