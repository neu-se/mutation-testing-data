  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iteration to advance to the next element, potentially skipping over important operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the iteration to peek at the next element without advancing the iteration, potentially causing the iteration to get stuck in an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.previous()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iteration to move backwards, potentially skipping over important operations.

DONE.
