  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Math.cosh```
This would result in different behavior because cosh is the hyperbolic cosine function, while cos is the regular cosine function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Math.tan```
This would result in different behavior because tan is the tangent function, which is different from the cosine function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Math.sin```
This would result in different behavior because sin is the sine function, which is different from the cosine function.

DONE.
