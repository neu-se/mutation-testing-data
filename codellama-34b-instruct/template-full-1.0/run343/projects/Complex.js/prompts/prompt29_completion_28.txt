  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `a` would be increased by 1 each time it is used, which could cause the `hypot` function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `a` would be decreased by 1 each time it is used, which could also cause the `hypot` function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `a` would be doubled each time it is used, which could cause the `hypot` function to return a different value.

DONE
