  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(reject(new Error("Q can't join: not the same: " + x + " " + y)))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function would be called with a new error object, which would cause the promise to be rejected with that error, rather than the original error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(x + y)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function would be called with the result of the addition of `x` and `y`, rather than the original value of `x`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(Q.reject(new Error("Q can't join: not the same: " + x + " " + y)))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.reject` function would be called with a new error object, which would cause the promise to be rejected with that error, rather than the original error.
