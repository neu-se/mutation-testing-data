  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return `Complex['INFINITY']`, regardless of the input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return `Complex['NAN']`, regardless of the input values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return `Complex['INFINITY']`, regardless of the input values.

DONE.
