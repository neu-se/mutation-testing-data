  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(this.index)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` deletes and/or inserts elements in an array, whereas `slice` extracts a shallow copy of a portion of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(this.index).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `reverse` reverses the order of the elements in an array, whereas `slice` extracts a shallow copy of a portion of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.filter((op) => op !== this.ops[this.index])
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` returns a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, whereas `slice` extracts a shallow copy of a portion of an array.

DONE.
