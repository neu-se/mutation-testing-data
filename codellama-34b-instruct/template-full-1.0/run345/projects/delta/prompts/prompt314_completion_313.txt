  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `inverted` delta is modified with a delete operation, but in this modified code, it is modified with a retain operation instead. This means that the resulting `inverted` delta would likely be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.push
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `inverted` delta is modified with a delete operation, but in this modified code, it is modified with a push operation instead. This means that the resulting `inverted` delta would likely be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `inverted` delta is modified with a delete operation, but in this modified code, it is modified with an insert operation instead. This means that the resulting `inverted` delta
