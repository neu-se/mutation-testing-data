This would result in different behavior because the original code calls `resetUnhandledRejections()`, which resets the `unhandledReasons` array as well as the `unhandledRejections` array. In contrast, this modified code only resets the `unhandledRejections` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
