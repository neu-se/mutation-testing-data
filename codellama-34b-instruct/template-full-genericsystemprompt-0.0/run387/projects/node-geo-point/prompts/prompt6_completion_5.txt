  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type = 'LineString'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromGeoJSON` method expects the `type` property of the input object to be `'Point'`, but this code fragment sets it to `'LineString'`, which would cause the method to throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates = [0, 0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromGeoJSON` method expects the `coordinates` property of the input object to be an array of two numbers, but this code fragment sets it to an array of two zeros, which would cause the method to throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates = [180, 90]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromGeoJSON` method expects the `coordinates` property of the input object to be an array of two numbers, but
