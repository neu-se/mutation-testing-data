  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '+' : '') + c
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but with a different operator. Instead of subtracting the value of `c` from the result, it adds it. This could potentially cause a different behavior in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + b
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but with a different variable. Instead of using `c`, it uses `b`. This could potentially cause a different behavior in the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + a
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but with a different variable. Instead of using `c`, it uses `a`. This could potentially cause a different behavior in the program.

DONE.
