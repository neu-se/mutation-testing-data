  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() {
    throw new Error("Buggy code");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the `promise` object, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the error "Buggy code".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() {
    return Q.reject("Buggy code");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the `promise` object, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the error "Buggy code".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() {
    return Q.resolve("Buggy code");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the `promise` object, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the value "Buggy code
