 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
name === null || name === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly checks for the `undefined` value instead of using the `void 0` expression. This change might affect how the code handles cases where the `name` variable has been declared but not assigned a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
name !== null && name !== 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the string `'undefined'` instead of the actual `undefined` value. This change might cause issues when checking against variables that have the value `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof name !== 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `typeof` operator to check for the existence of the `name` variable. This change might affect how the code handles cases where the `name` variable has been declared but not assigned a value.

DONE.
