  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a == 0` condition would be true when `a` is 0, which would cause the `ret += a` statement to be executed, even though `a` is 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a === 0` condition would be true when `a` is 0, which would cause the `ret += a` statement to be executed, even though `a` is 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a !== 0` condition would be true when `a` is 0, which would cause the `ret += a` statement to be executed, even though `a` is 0.

DONE.
