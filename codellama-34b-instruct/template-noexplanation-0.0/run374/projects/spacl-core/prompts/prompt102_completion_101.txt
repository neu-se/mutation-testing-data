  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.path
```
This code fragment is a property access expression that accesses the `path` property of the `ctx` object. It is a different behavior than the original code fragment, which was `ctx`, which is a reference to the `ctx` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.path.toLowerCase()
```
This code fragment is a method call expression that calls the `toLowerCase()` method on the `path` property of the `ctx` object. It is a different behavior than the original code fragment, which was `ctx`, which is a reference to the `ctx` object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.path.split('/').pop()
```
This code fragment is a method call expression that calls the `split()` method on the `path` property of the `ctx` object, and then calls the `pop()` method on the resulting array. It is a different behavior than the original code fragment, which
