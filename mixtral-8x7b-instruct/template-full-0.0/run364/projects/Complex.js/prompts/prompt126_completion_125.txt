 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `this.isInfinite` property exists, while the modified code invokes the (possibly undefined) `this.isInfinite` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `this.re` property is infinite, while the modified code calculates the reciprocal of `this.re`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(this['re']) > 1e20
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `this.re` property is infinite, while the modified code checks if its absolute value is greater than a large number.

DONE.
