  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `object` is a variable that may have a value, while `null` is a null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `object` is a variable that may have a value, while `undefined` is a value that indicates the variable has not been assigned a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `object` is a variable that may have a value, while `NaN` is a value that indicates an invalid or undefined numerical value.

DONE.
