 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the error callback would receive the value `1` instead of `null`, which could cause the calling code to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data
```
This would result in different behavior because the error callback would receive the `data` value instead of `null`, which could cause the calling code to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Something went wrong')
```
This would result in different behavior because an error object would be passed to the error callback instead of `null`, which could cause the calling code to handle the error differently.

DONE.
