  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the wrong index of the `attempt1` array, leading to an unrelated error or no error at all.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access a non-existent index of the `attempt1` array, leading to an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the wrong index of the `attempt2` array, leading to an unrelated error or no error at all.

DONE.
