  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would provide a different value for the notify parameter, which could cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would provide a different value for the notify parameter, which could cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would provide a different value for the notify parameter, which could cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
