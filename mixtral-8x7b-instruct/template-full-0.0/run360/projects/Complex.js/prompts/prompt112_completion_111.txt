 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the imaginary part of the complex number to 0, even if the original code would have set it to a non-zero value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] = 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the imaginary part of the complex number to 1, regardless of the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the imaginary part of the complex number to a random value, rather than the original value.

DONE.
