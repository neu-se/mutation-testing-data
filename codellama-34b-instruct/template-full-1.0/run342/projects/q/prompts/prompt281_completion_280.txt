  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the `arguments` object instead of the `arguments` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the `arguments` object starting from the second element, instead of starting from the first element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the `arguments` object starting from the first element and ending at the second element, instead of returning the entire `arguments` object.

DONE.
