  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return value; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `this.then` which returns a promise, while the new code fragment returns a function that returns the value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { throw new Error(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `this.then` which returns a promise, while the new code fragment throws an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `this.then` which returns a promise, while the new code fragment returns undefined.

DONE.
