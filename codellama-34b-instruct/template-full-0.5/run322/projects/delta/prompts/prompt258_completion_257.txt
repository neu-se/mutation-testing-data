  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const otherOp = new Delta(this.ops.slice());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new Delta object with a copy of the current object's ops, instead of referencing the other Delta object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const otherOp = this.ops.slice().reverse();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new array with the current object's ops in reverse order, instead of referencing the other Delta object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const otherOp = this.ops.slice();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new array with the current object's ops, instead of referencing the other Delta object.

DONE.
