  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a shallow copy of the array, while `concat()` returns a new array that is the result of concatenating the two arrays.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops.splice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice()` removes the first element of the array, while `concat()` returns a new array that is the result of concatenating the two arrays.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift()` removes the first element of the array, while `concat()` returns a new array that is the result of concatenating the two arrays.

DONE.
