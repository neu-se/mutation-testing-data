  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse` method would not be called with the `true` option, which means that the URL would not be normalized. This could lead to false positives or false negatives in the test results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse` method would not be called with a Boolean parameter, and the URL would not be normalized. This could lead to false positives or false negatives in the test results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse` method would not be called with a undefined parameter, and the URL would not be normalized. This could lead to false positives or false negatives in the test results.

DONE.
