  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `uncork` method is not called, which would prevent the write stream from being uncorked, resulting in a different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cork` method is called, which would prevent the write stream from being corked, resulting in a different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` method is called, which would close the write stream, resulting in a different behavior.

DONE.
