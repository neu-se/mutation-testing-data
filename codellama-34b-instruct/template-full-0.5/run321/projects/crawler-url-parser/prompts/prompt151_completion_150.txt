  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.host.includes(pageurl.host)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `includes` method checks if the first argument is a substring of the second argument, whereas the `==` operator checks for strict equality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.host.indexOf(linkurl.host) > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `indexOf` method checks if the first argument is a substring of the second argument, whereas the `==` operator checks for strict equality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.host != pageurl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!=` operator checks for inequality, whereas the `==` operator checks for strict equality.

DONE.
