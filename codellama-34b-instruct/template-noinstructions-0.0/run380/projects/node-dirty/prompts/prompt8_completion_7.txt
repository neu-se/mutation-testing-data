  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `val` is undefined, but replacing it with `null` would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false`, potentially causing the `set` method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `val` is undefined, but replacing it with `undefined` would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true`, potentially causing the `set` method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `val` is undefined, but replacing it with `NaN` would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false`, potentially causing the `set` method to behave differently.

DONE.
