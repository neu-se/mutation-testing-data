  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 0 || c === ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the character is a digit or a decimal point, while the new code fragment checks if the character is a space.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 0 || c === '.'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the character is a digit or a decimal point, while the new code fragment checks if the character is a decimal point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 0 || c === '+'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the character is a digit or a decimal point, while the new code fragment checks if the character is a plus sign.

DONE.
