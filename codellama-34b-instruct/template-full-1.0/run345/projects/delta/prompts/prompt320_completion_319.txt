  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.retain` is likely to be a number, so adding 1 would change the meaning of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.insert` is likely to be a string, so using it in place of `op.retain` would change the meaning of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.delete` is likely to be a function or a property, so using it in place of `op.retain` would change the meaning of the code.

DONE.
