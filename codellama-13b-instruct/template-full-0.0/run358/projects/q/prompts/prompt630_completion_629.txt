  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `dispatch` method of the `Q` object, while the buggy code fragment is a reference to the `dispatch` method of the `Promise` object. This could cause the test to fail if the `Promise` object has a different implementation of the `dispatch` method than the `Q` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
