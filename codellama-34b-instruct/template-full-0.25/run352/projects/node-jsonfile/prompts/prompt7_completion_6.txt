  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFileSync` is a synchronous version of `fs.readFile`, which means that it will block the event loop until the file is read, whereas `fs.readFile` is an asynchronous version that returns a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFile.bind(null, file)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFile.bind(null, file)` creates a new function that is bound to the `fs.readFile` function, but with the `file` argument already bound. This means that the new function will always read the same file, regardless of the argument passed to it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFile.bind(null, file, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFile.bind(null, file, options)` creates a new function that is bound to
