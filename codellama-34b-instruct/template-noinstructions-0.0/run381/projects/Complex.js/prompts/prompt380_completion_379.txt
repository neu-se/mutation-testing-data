  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is used to calculate the `sinh` and `cosh` functions, while the new code fragment `a` would not be used in those calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is used to calculate the `sinh` and `cosh` functions, while the new code fragment `b + 1` would result in different values for those functions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is used to calculate the `sinh` and `cosh` functions, while the new code fragment `b * 2` would result in different values for those functions.

DONE.
