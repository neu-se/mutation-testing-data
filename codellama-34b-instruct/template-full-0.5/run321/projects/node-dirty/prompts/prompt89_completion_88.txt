  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the length of the string instead of checking if the string is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the string is empty instead of checking if the string is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the string is null instead of checking if the string is falsy.

DONE.
