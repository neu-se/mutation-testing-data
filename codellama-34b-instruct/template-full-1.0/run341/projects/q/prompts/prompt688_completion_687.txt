  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a method that resolves the promise with a given value, whereas `dispatch` is a method that dispatches the promise to a different context. If we replace `dispatch` with `resolve`, the promise will be resolved with the value of the `object` argument, which is not what we want.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.reject

If we replace `dispatch` with `reject`, the promise will be rejected the moment it is created, which is not what we want.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `notify` is a method that notifies the promise of progress, whereas `dispatch` is a method that dispatch
