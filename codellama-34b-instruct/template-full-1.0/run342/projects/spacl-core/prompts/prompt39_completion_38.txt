  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `1` is treated as a truthy value, but when replaced with `0`, it becomes a falsy value, which would cause the subsequent code to execute differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `1` is treated as a truthy value, but when replaced with `2`, it is a different truthy value, which would cause the subsequent code to execute differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `1` is treated as a truthy value, but when replaced with `-1`, it becomes a falsy value, which would cause the subsequent code to execute differently.

DONE.
