 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
isNaN(this.re + this.im)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the sum of the real and imaginary parts is NaN, instead of checking if either part is NaN.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Number.isNaN(this.re) || Number.isNaN(this.im)
