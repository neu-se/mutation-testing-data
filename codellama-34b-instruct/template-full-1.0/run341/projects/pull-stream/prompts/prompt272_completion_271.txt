  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `values` function would return an empty array instead of the stream, causing the `nextChunk` function to never be called and the `nextStream` function to be called repeatedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `values` function would return an undefined value instead of the stream, causing the `nextChunk` function to never be called and the `nextStream` function to be called repeatedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `values` function would return a zero-length array instead of the stream, causing the `nextChunk` function to never be called and the `nextStream` function to be called repeatedly.

DONE.
