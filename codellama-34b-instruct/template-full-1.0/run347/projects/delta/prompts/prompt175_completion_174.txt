  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return typeof otherOp.retain === 'number' ? length : otherOp.retain;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `thisIter.peekLength()` to get the length of the current operation in `thisIter`, while the modified code uses `length` from the diff result, which may not be the same.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Math.min(thisIter.peekLength(), length);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `otherIter.peekLength()` to get the length of the current operation in `otherIter`, while the modified code uses `length` from the diff result, which may not be the same.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Math.max(thisIter.peekLength(), length);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Math.min()` to ensure that the length of the current operation in `thisIter`
