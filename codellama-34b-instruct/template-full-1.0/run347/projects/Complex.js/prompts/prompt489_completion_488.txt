  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ 'value': false }
```
This would result in different behavior because the value property of the return object would be false, which may cause unexpected results in code that relies on the value being true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ 'value': NaN }
```
This would result in different behavior because the value property of the return object would be NaN (Not a Number), which may cause unexpected results in code that relies on the value being a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ 'value': (function() { throw new Error('Custom error message'); }()) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the value property of the return object would be a function that throws an error with a custom message, which may cause unexpected results in code that relies on the value being a primitive data type.

DONE.
