  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with "delete".

This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a reserved word in JavaScript and would throw a SyntaxError if used in this context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with "throw".

This would result in different behavior because `throw` would cause the `dispatch` method to throw an error, rather than returning a promise as expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with "return x".

This would result in different behavior because `return x` would return the value of `x` directly, rather than returning a promise for the value of `x` as expected.

DONE.
