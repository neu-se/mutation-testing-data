  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gettype` function would receive a `null` value as the `linkurl` parameter, which would cause it to throw a `TypeError` when trying to access the `subdomain` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gettype` function would receive an `undefined` value as the `linkurl` parameter, which would cause it to throw a `TypeError` when trying to access the `subdomain` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"www.example.com"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gettype` function would receive a string value as the `linkurl` parameter, which would cause it to return a different type than the original code.

DONE.
