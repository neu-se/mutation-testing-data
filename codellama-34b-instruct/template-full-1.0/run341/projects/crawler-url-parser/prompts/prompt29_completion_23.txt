  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr + "'"
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.parse()` would return `null` for the modified `currentUrlStr` value, which would cause the function to return early with `null` instead of parsing the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.parse()` would not be able to parse the modified `currentUrlStr` value, which would cause the function to return early with `null` instead of parsing the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"http://example.com"
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.parse()` would parse the modified `currentUrlStr` value as a URL with the host `example.com`, which would cause the function to return a different result instead of parsing the original URL.

DONE.
