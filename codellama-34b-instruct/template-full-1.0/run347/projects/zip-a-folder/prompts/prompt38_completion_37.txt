  Sure, here are three potential options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with different code fragments:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isGlob
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the check for whether the `src` is a glob or not, potentially leading to incorrect archiving behavior in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `zipArchive.glob()` method to always be called, potentially leading to incorrect archiving behavior in some cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob && src !== '*'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only call the `zipArchive.glob()` method when the `src` is a glob and not the special glob pattern `*`, potentially leading to incorrect archiving behavior in some cases.

DONE.
