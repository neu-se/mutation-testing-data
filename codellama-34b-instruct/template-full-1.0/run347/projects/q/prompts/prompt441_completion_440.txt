  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a property access, not a function call.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit.apply(this, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was accessing a property, not calling a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit.call(this, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was accessing a property, not calling a function.

DONE.
