  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return !(this['isNaN']() || this['isFinite'](0));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the complex number is not at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere, while the new code fragment always returns `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return !(this['isNaN']() || this['isFinite'](1));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the complex number is not at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere, while the new code fragment always returns `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return !(this['isNaN']() || this['isFinite'](-1));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the complex number is not at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere, while the new code fragment always returns `false`.

DONE.
