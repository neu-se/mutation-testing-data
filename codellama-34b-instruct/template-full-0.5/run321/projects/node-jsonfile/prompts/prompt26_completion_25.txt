  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.replacer
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.replacer` is a different function than `options.reviver`, and it may not handle the same cases correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.reviver()
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.reviver()` is a function call, and it may return a different value than `options.reviver`, which is a property access.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.reviver || options.replacer
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.reviver || options.replacer` is a boolean expression that returns `options.replacer` if `options.reviver` is falsy, and it may not handle the same cases correctly as `options.reviver`.

DONE.
