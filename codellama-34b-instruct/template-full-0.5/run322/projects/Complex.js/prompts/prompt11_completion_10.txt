  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` and `Math.cos` have different ranges and output values, which could affect the calculation of `cosm1` and `hypot`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(x) + Math.exp(-x)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `cosh` function, which is not the same as `Math.exp(x) + Math.exp(-x)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(x) - Math.exp(-x)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `cosh` function, which is not the same as `Math.exp(x) - Math.exp(-x)`.

DONE.
