  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace(/b/, 'e'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is not the same as the original code fragment. While the original code fragment replaced the letter "a" with "e", this new code fragment replaces the letter "b" with "e".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace(/^a/, 'e'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is different. While the original code fragment replaced only the first instance of "a" with "e", this new code fragment replaces all instances of "a" at the beginning of the string with "e".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, function() { return 'e'; }); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement function is different. While the original code fragment replaced "a" with "e
