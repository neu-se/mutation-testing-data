  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result, { [country]: { current: [id], all: [] } }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `current` property would always be initialized with the `id` value, instead of an empty array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result, { [country]: { current: [], all: [id] } }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` property would always be initialized with the `id` value, instead of an empty array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result, { [country]: { current: [id], all: [id] } }
```
This would result in different behavior because both the `current` and `all` properties would always be initialized with the `id` value, instead of empty arrays.

DONE.
