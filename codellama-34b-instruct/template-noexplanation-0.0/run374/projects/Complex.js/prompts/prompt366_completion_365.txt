  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This change will cause the `cosh` function to return a different value than it would with the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This change will cause the `cosh` function to return a different value than it would with the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This change will cause the `cosh` function to return a different value than it would with the original code fragment.

DONE.
