  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type.toLowerCase()
```
This will cause the `type` function to always return the lowercase version of the input string, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type.toUpperCase()
```
This will cause the `type` function to always return the uppercase version of the input string, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type.slice(1)
```
This will cause the `type` function to always return the input string without the first character, which may not be the desired behavior.

DONE.
