  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [args, name]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` and `name` arguments would be reversed, potentially leading to a different outcome in the `dispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, args, function () {}]
```
This would result in different behavior because an additional `function () {}` argument would be passed to the `dispatch` method, which could potentially affect its behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` argument would be missing, potentially leading to a different outcome in the `dispatch` method.

DONE.
