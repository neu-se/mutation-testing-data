Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
ENOTDIR, 'open', filename
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the error code from `EEXIST` (file already exists) to `ENOTDIR` (not a directory), which would cause the function to throw a different error when the file already exists and the `O_EXCL` flag is set.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
EPERM, 'open', link.getPath()
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the error code from `EEXIST` to `EPERM` (operation not permitted) and also changes the error message to include the path of the link instead of the filename, which could affect error handling and logging.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
EACCES, 'open', filename
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the error code from `EEXIST` (file already exists) to `EACCES` (permission denied), which would cause the function to throw a permission-related error when the file already exists and the `O_EXCL` flag is set, instead
