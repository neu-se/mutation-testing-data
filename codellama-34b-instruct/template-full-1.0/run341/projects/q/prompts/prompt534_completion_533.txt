  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolved
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved instead of rejected, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
notified
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be notified instead of rejected, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
now
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved immediately instead of being rejected, potentially leading to unexpected results.

DONE.
