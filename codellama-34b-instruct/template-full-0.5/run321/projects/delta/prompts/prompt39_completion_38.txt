  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the property is undefined, while this new code fragment checks if the property is not undefined. This change would cause the `transform` function to return a different value in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the property is undefined, while this new code fragment checks if the property is null. This change would cause the `transform` function to return a different value in some cases.

DONE.
