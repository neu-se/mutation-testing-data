  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|index/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 3) + 'ices' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `substr(0, w.length - 2)` to remove the last two characters of the word, while this modified code fragment uses `substr(0, w.length - 3)` to remove the last three characters. This would cause the function to produce incorrect results for words that end in "ices" but not in "ex".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|index/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ices' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `substr(0, w.length - 2)` to remove the last two characters of the word, while this modified code fragment uses `substr(0, w.length - 2)` to remove the last three characters.
