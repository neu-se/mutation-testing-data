Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ ...this._micromatchOptions, dot: false }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dot` option is set to `false`, which means that dot files will not be matched by the negative patterns, whereas the original code sets it to `true`, allowing dot files to be matched.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._micromatchOptions
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dot` option is not explicitly set to `true`, which means that its value will be whatever is defined in `this._micromatchOptions`, potentially changing the behavior of the negative pattern matching.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ ...this._micromatchOptions, nocase: !this._micromatchOptions.nocase }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nocase` option is inverted, which means that the negative pattern matching will be case-sensitive if it was previously case-insensitive, and vice versa, potentially changing the set of matched files.

DONE.
