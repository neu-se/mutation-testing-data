  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(otherIter.next())
```
This would result in different behavior because `Op.length()` returns the length of the op while `otherIter.peekLength()` returns the length of the next op.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(otherIter.next().length)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs()` returns the absolute value of the op.length, while otherIter.peekLength() returns the length of the next op.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(1).length
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next(1)` returns the length of the next op, while `otherIter.peekLength()` returns the length of the next op.

DONE.
