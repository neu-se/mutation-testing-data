  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to enter the `if` block, even if the promise is not rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!inspect
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to enter the `else` block, even if the promise is rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof inspect === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to enter the `if` block only if `inspect` is a function, and not if it is a property or method.

DONE.
