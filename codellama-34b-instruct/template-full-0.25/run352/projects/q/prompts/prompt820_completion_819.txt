  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, fulfilled, progress
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, causing the `rejected` callback to be called instead of the `fulfilled` callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progress, null
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument `null` is added to the end of the argument list, which would cause an error to be thrown if the `progress` callback is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progress, function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument `function() {}` is added to the end of the argument list, which would cause the `progress` callback to be called with an empty function instead of the expected value.

DONE.
