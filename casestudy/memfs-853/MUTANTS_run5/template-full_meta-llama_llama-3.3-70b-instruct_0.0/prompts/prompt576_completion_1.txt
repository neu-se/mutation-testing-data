Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
throw new Error(`EEXIST: ${filename} already exists`);
```
This would result in different behavior because it throws a generic Error object instead of a custom error object created by `createError`, which may have additional properties or methods that are expected by the surrounding code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
console.error('EEXIST: file already exists');
```
This would result in different behavior because it logs an error message to the console instead of throwing an error, allowing the program to continue executing without interruption.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
return createError(ENOENT, 'open', filename);
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns an error object instead of throwing it, potentially causing the function to return an error object instead of propagating it up the call stack.

DONE.
