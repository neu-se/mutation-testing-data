  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i--]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i--` operator would decrement the value of `i` by 1, causing the function to return the previous element in the array instead of the current one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i + 1` operator would return the next element in the array instead of the current one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i * 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i * 2` operator would return the element at index `i * 2` in the array, which may not be the same as the current element.

DONE.
