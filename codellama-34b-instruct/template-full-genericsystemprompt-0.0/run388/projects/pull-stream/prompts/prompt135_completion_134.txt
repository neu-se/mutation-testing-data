  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `cb` function, while this replacement calls the `abort` function with the error object as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `cb` function with the error object as an argument, while this replacement calls the `cb` function with `null` as the first argument and the error object as the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `cb` function with the error object as an argument, while this replacement calls the `cb` function with the error object as the first argument and `null` as the second argument.

DONE.
