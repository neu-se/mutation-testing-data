  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = length;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property is not being set to the correct value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = length + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property is being set to a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = length - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property is being set to a different value than the original code.

DONE.
