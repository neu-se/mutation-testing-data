  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field, false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unique` function would no longer be called with the `true` argument, which is used to indicate that the function should return the unique elements of the array. Without this argument, the function would return the entire array, which would result in the `nonUnique` function returning an empty array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unique` function would be called with a `null` argument, which would result in an error being thrown. The `nonUnique` function would not be able to handle this error and would likely crash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unique` function would be called with an `undefined` argument, which would result in an error being thrown. The `nonUnique` function would not be able to handle this error and would likely crash.
