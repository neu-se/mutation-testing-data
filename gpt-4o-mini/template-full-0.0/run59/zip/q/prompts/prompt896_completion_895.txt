Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because setting `defer` to `null` would cause a runtime error when trying to call `defer()` later in the code, leading to unhandled promise rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer = function() { return {}; };
```
This would result in different behavior because redefining `defer` to return an empty object instead of a proper deferred object would prevent the promise from being resolved or rejected correctly, resulting in promises that never settle.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer = function() { return { resolve: function() {}, reject: function() {} }; };
```
This would result in different behavior because the new `defer` function would create a deferred object that has `resolve` and `reject` methods that do nothing, meaning that even if the promise is fulfilled or rejected, it would not propagate the resolution or rejection, leading to promises that appear to hang indefinitely.

DONE.
