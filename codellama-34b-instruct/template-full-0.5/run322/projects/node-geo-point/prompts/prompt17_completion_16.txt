  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, which would cause the `fromLngLatArray()` method to interpret the latitude and longitude values in the wrong order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.concat([0])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat()` method adds the value `0` to the end of the array, which would cause the `fromLngLatArray()` method to interpret the latitude and longitude values as having an incorrect number of elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop()` method removes the last element from the array, which would cause the `fromLngLatArray()` method to interpret the latitude and longitude values as having an incorrect number of elements.

DONE.
