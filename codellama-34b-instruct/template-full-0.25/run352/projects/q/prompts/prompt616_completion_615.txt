  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a bound context, which would cause the `dispatch` method to be called on a different object than the one intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` sets the context of the `dispatch` method to `null`, which would cause it to be called on a different object than the one intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.apply(null, [])
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` sets the context of the `dispatch` method to `null` and passes an empty array as the arguments, which would cause it to be called on a different object than the one intended.

DONE.
