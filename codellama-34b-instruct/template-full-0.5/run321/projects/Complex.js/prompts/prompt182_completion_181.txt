  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (z['isZero'](0)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for zero values in the `z` object, while this new fragment checks for zero values in the `0` constant.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (z['isZero'](NaN)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for zero values in the `z` object, while this new fragment checks for `NaN` values in the `NaN` constant.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (z['isZero'](Infinity)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for zero values in the `z` object, while this new fragment checks for `Infinity` values in the `Infinity` constant.

DONE.
