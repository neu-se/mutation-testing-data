  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event `'error'` is emitted when an error occurs, whereas the event `'load'` is emitted when the database is loaded. By replacing `'load'` with `'error'`, the code would emit an error event when the database is loaded, which would cause the test suite to fail if it is not expecting this behavior.
