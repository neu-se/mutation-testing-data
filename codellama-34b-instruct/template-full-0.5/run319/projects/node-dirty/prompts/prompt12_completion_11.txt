  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val
```
This would result in different behavior because `val` is the value being set, whereas `key` is the key being set.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + '1'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the string `'1'` to the key, which would change the key being set.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would generate a random number, which would change the key being set.

DONE.
