  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it skips the first argument in the `arguments` object. This could cause the function to behave differently than expected if the first argument is important.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it only takes the first argument from the `arguments` object. This could cause the function to behave differently than expected if the first argument is not the only important argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it skips the first two arguments in the `arguments` object. This could cause the function to behave differently than expected if the first two arguments are important.

DONE.
