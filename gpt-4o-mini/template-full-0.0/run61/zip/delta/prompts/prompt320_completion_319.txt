Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always retain a length of zero, effectively ignoring the operation and potentially leading to data loss in the inversion process.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly increase the retained length by one, which could lead to an off-by-one error in the resulting inverted Delta, causing inconsistencies in the data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a null value instead of a number, which could cause runtime errors or unexpected behavior when the inverted Delta is processed, as it would not be a valid retain length.

DONE.
