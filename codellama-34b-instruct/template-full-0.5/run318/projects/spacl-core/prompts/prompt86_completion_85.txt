  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method is called with a different argument, which would create a shallow copy of the rule instead of a deep copy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(true, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method is called with a different argument, which would create a deep copy of the rule but without cloning the underlying rules.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(true, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method is called with a different argument, which would create a deep copy of the rule and also clone the underlying rules.

DONE.
