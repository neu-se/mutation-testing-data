  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code === 'EACCES'
```
This would result in different behavior because `EACCES` is a different error code than `ENOENT`, and the code would behave differently when encountering this error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code === 'ENOTDIR'
```
This would result in different behavior because `ENOTDIR` is a different error code than `ENOENT`, and the code would behave differently when encountering this error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code === 'EISDIR'
```
This would result in different behavior because `EISDIR` is a different error code than `ENOENT`, and the code would behave differently when encountering this error.

DONE.
