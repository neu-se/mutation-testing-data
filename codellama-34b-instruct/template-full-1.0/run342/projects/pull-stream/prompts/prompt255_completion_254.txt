  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
read(null, function () {
  nextStream();
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was calling the `nextStream` function directly, while this replacement code fragment is passing it as a callback to the `read` function. This change could potentially cause the program to behave differently in certain situations, such as if the `read` function is modified to expect a different type of argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
read(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was passing a null value as the second argument to the `read` function, while this replacement code fragment is passing no arguments at all. This change could potentially cause the program to behave differently in certain situations, such as if the `read` function is modified to expect a different number of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
_read = function () {
  return nextStream();
}
```
This would result
