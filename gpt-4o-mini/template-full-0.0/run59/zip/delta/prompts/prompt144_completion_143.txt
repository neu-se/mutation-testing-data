Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstLeft += thisIter.peekLength();
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly increases `firstLeft` instead of decreasing it, which would lead to an incorrect calculation of how many characters are left to process from `firstOther.retain`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstLeft = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it resets `firstLeft` to zero, causing the loop to skip processing any remaining operations that should be accounted for, potentially leading to lost operations in the composed delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstLeft -= thisIter.peekLength() + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it subtracts an additional 1 from `firstLeft`, which would incorrectly account for an extra length, leading to an off-by-one error in the processing of operations.

DONE.
