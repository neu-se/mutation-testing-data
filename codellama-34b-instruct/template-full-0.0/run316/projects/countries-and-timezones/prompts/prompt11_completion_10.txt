  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] = { [country]: { current: [], all: [] } };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign a new object to `result[country]` instead of merging the existing object with a new one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] = { [country]: { current: [id], all: [id] } };
```

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] = { [country]: { current: [...result[country].current, id], all: [...result[country].all, id] } };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign a new object to `result[country]` with the `current
