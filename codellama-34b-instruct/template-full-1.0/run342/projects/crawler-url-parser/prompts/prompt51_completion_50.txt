  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
``` 
This would result in different behavior because the `.resolve()` method would return `undefined` instead of a URL, leading to a different outcome in the `extract()` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
``` 
This would result in different behavior because the `.resolve()` method would return `null` instead of a URL, leading to a different outcome in the `extract()` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.resolve()` method would compare `baseUrl` to `parsedUrl` instead of `parsedBaseUrl`, potentially leading to a different outcome in the `extract()` function.

DONE.
