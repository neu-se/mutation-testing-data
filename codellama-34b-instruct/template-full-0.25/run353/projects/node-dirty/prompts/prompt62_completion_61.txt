  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy(new Error('Test error'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the write stream to be destroyed with an error, which would trigger the `error` event to be emitted, whereas the original code would not emit the `error` event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(() => this._writeStream.destroy());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the write stream to be ended and then destroyed, whereas the original code would only destroy the write stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the write stream to be destroyed without emitting the `end` event, whereas the original code would emit the `end` event before destroying the write stream.

DONE.
