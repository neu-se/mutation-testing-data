 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function is not being called, and therefore the `deferred` object with its methods will not be returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred` object will not be returned, and any further attempts to call `resolve`, `fulfill`, `reject`, or `notify` methods on a `null` value will result in errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty object is returned instead of the `deferred` object. The returned object will not have the methods `resolve`, `fulfill`, `reject`, or `notify`, and any further attempts to call these methods will result in errors.

DONE.
