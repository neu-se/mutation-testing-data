  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `calculateDistance` method to use the longitude of the current `GeoPoint` object instead of the latitude, which would lead to incorrect calculations and potentially cause the method to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `calculateDistance` method to use a latitude that is one degree higher than the actual latitude of the current `GeoPoint` object, which would lead to incorrect calculations and potentially cause the method to return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `calculateDistance` method to use a latitude that is twice the actual latitude of the current `GeoPoint` object, which would lead to incorrect calculations and potentially cause the method to return incorrect results.
