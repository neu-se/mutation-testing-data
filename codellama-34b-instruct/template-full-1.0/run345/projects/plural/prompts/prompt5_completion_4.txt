  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` is an operator that returns the type of a variable, while `Object.prototype.toString.call` is a function that returns a string representing the object's type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString` is a method that returns a string representing the object's type, while `Object.prototype.toString.call` is a function that invokes the `toString` method on the object and returns its result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function toString() { return 'foo' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the string `'foo'` instead of the object's actual type.

DONE.
