  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\' + $1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would escape the `$` character in the regex, making it a literal character instead of a capture group.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\$(\d+)/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only match the first `$` character in the string, and the `\d+` pattern would consume all digits after the `$` character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\$1"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the `$` character a literal character, and the `1` would be treated as a literal character as well.

DONE.
