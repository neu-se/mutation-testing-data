  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was expecting a positive integer, but a zero would cause the substring() method to return an empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was expecting a positive integer, but a negative number would cause the substring() method to return an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(length + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was expecting a positive integer, but a value greater than the length of the string would cause the substring() method to return an empty string.

DONE.
