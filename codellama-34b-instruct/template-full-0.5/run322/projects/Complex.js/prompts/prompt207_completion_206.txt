  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 && b === 0 && z['re'] > 0 && z['im'] < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if both `a` and `b` are equal to 0, while this replacement only checks if `b` is equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 && b === 0 && z['re'] < 0 && z['im'] >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if both `a` and `b` are equal to 0, while this replacement only checks if `a` is equal to 0.
