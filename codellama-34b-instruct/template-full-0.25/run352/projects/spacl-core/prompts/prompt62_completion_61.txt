  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, while the original code fragment `props.reverse` would return a new array with the elements in reverse order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.slice().reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method returns a shallow copy of the array, while the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.concat().reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat()` method returns a new array with the elements of the original array and the elements of the argument array, while the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array.

DONE.
