Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => callback()
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces an unnecessary anonymous function that calls the callback, potentially changing the execution context or introducing additional overhead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.closeFile
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes the `closeFile` method itself as the callback, instead of calling it and passing the result to the callback, potentially leading to incorrect function invocation or data corruption.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes `null` as the callback, which would likely cause an error when the `wrapAsync` method attempts to invoke it, potentially masking the original error or changing the error handling behavior.

DONE.
