  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `trackRejection` function to be called, which would track the rejection and add it to the `unhandledRejections` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!trackUnhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `untrackRejection` function to be called, which would untrack the rejection and remove it from the `unhandledRejections` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `trackRejection` function to be called, which would track the rejection and add it to the `unhandledRejections` array, even if the rejection was already tracked.

DONE.
