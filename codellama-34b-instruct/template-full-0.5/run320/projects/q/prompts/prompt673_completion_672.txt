  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the dispatch method to be called on `undefined` instead of an object, which would likely throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the dispatch method to be called on `null` instead of an object, which would likely throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the dispatch method to be called on the string "foo" instead of an object, which would likely throw an error.

DONE.
