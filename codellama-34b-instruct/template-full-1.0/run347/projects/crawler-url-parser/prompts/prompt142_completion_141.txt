  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\./, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the "default." part of the URL, which could lead to a different resource being retrieved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default2\./, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove a different part of the URL, which could lead to a different resource being retrieved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nil
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not remove any part of the URL, which could lead to the same resource being retrieved.

DONE.
