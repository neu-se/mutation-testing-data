  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would be called with a length of 1, which would remove one element from the array, rather than the intended behavior of removing all elements from the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would be called with a length of -1, which would remove all elements from the array, rather than the intended behavior of removing one element from the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would be called with a length of 0, which would not remove any elements from the array, rather than the intended behavior of removing one element from the array.

DONE.
