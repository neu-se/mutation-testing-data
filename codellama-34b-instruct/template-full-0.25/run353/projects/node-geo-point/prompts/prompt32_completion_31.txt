  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(point1.longitude + point2.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `deg2rad` function to convert the longitude values to radians, while this replacement code fragment simply adds the two longitude values without any conversion. This would cause the calculation of the bearing to be incorrect, which could lead to incorrect results in the `calculateDestination` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(point1.longitude - point2.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `deg2rad` function to convert the longitude values to radians, while this replacement code fragment simply subtracts the two longitude values without any conversion. This would cause the calculation of the bearing to be incorrect, which could lead to incorrect results in the `calculateDestination` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(point1.longitude * point2.longitude)
```
