  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty function would not allow for any custom transformation to be applied to the data. In the original code, `Delta.getHandler()` is used to retrieve a handler function that can be used to transform the data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid callback function and would throw an error when trying to call it. In the original code, the `Delta.getHandler()` function is used to retrieve a valid callback function that can be used to transform the data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(arg) {
  return arg.length;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the new function returns the length of the `arg` argument, which is not the same as the original function, which returns an object with the `embedType` and `data` properties. In the original code, the `Delta.get
