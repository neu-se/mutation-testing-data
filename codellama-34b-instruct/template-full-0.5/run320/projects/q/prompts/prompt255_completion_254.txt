  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.promiseDispatch.apply(newPromise, message)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method would be called on the `promiseDispatch` function, but the `this` value would be bound to `newPromise`, which is not the same as the `this` value in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.promiseDispatch.call(newPromise, message)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method would be called on the `promiseDispatch` function, but the `this` value would be bound to `newPromise`, which is not the same as the `this` value in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.promiseDispatch.bind(newPromise)(message)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method would be called on the `promiseDispatch` function,
