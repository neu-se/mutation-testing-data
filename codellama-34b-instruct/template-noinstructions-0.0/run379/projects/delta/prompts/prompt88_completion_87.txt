  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.insert === 'number' &&
          typeof lastOp.insert === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if both `newOp.insert` and `lastOp.insert` are strings, while this code checks if they are both numbers. This could cause the code to produce different results if the input data is different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.insert === 'object' &&
          typeof lastOp.insert === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if both `newOp.insert` and `lastOp.insert` are strings, while this code checks if they are both objects. This could cause the code to produce different results if the input data is different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.insert === 'function' &&
          typeof lastOp.insert === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original
