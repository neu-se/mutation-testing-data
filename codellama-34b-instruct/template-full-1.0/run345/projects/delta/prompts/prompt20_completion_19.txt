  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!!b
```
This would result in different behavior because if `b` is an object, `!b` would evalute to `false`, whereas `!!b` would evalute to `true`. If the `diff` function is called with `b` as an object, it would return `undefined` instead of an object with the expected properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b | {}
```
This would result in different behavior because if `b` is not an object, the bitwise OR operator `|` would return `b` instead of an empty object `{}`. If the `diff` function is called with `b` as a non-object value, it would return an object with the expected properties instead of `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because if `b` is a falsy value (such as `0`, `false`, or `null`), the logical OR operator `||
