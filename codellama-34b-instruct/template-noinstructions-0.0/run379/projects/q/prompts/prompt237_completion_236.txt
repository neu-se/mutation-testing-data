  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `messages.length` is always truthy, even if the promise is already resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `messages[0]` is `undefined` if the promise is already resolved, and `undefined` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `messages.length > 0` is only true if the promise is not already resolved.

DONE.
