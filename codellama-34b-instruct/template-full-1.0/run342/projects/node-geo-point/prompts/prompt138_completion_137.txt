  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.longitude` is a different variable than `this.latitude`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a number and would cause the `parseFloat()` function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` (Not a Number) is a special value in JavaScript that is returned when an operation results in a value that is not a number. In this case, `parseFloat()` would not throw an error but would return `NaN`.

DONE.
