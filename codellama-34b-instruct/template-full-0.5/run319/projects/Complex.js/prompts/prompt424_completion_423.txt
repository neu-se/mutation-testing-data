  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` checks if a value is a finite number, whereas `isInfinite` checks if a value is infinite. Using `isFinite` instead would cause the code to behave differently for infinite values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the real part of the complex number is equal to infinity, whereas `isInfinite` checks if the absolute value of the complex number is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the imaginary part of the complex number is equal to zero, whereas `isInfinite` checks if the absolute value of the complex number is infinite.

DONE.
