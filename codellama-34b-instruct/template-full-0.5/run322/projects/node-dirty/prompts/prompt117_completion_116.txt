  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method would no longer be available, and any attempts to call it would result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit = () => {};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method would be replaced with a no-op function, and any attempts to call it would do nothing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit = (event) => { throw new Error(event); };
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method would throw an error with the name of the event as the message, which would cause any attempts to call it to fail.

DONE.
