  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cos` function to be called with the wrong argument, leading to an incorrect calculation of the complex number's arccosine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cos` function to be called with a different argument, leading to an incorrect calculation of the complex number's arccosine.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cos` function to be called with a different argument, leading to an incorrect calculation of the complex number's arccosine.

DONE.
