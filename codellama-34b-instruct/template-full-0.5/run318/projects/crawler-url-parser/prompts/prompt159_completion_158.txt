Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a regular expression to match the last part of the URL path, while the replaced code would simply remove the last part of the URL path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\/"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a regular expression to match the last part of the URL path, while the replaced code would simply remove the last part of the URL path.
