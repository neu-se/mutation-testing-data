  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/^(?:wo)?man$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/o/, 'e') })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a case-insensitive regular expression to match the word "man" or "woman", but the new code fragment uses a case-sensitive regular expression to match only the word "man".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/^(?:wo)?man$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/o/, 'a') })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the letter "o" with "e", but the new code fragment replaces the letter "o" with "a".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/^(?:wo)?man$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/o/, 'i') })
```
This would result in
