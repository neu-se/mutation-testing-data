  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete || typeof op.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.delete` is truthy or if `typeof op.retain === 'number'`, while the buggy code fragment checks if `op.delete` is truthy or if `typeof op.retain === 'object'`. This could result in different behavior if the `op.retain` property is not a number, but an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete || typeof op.retain === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.delete` is truthy or if `typeof op.retain === 'number'`, while the buggy code fragment checks if `op.delete` is truthy or if `typeof op.retain === 'object'`. This could result in different behavior if the `op.retain` property is not a number, but an object.
