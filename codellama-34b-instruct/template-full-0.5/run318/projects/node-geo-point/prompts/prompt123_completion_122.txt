  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a GeoPoint object, but null is not a GeoPoint object and would cause a type error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new GeoPoint(0, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a GeoPoint object with specific latitude and longitude values, but the new code would create a GeoPoint object with latitude and longitude values of 0, which would cause the calculations to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a GeoPoint object, but the new code would use the current GeoPoint object as the point, which could cause the calculations to be incorrect if the current object is not the correct point.

DONE.
