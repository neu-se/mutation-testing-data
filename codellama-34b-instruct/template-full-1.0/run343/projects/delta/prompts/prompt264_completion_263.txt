  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain, otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` is a different attribute than `attributes`, and it is not clear what the intention of the code fragment is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert, otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` is a different attribute than `attributes`, and it is not clear what the intention of the code fragment is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.delete, otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a different attribute than `attributes`, and it is not clear what the intention of the code fragment is.

DONE.
