  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `object` is a reference to the object being operated on, while `null` is a null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `object` is a reference to the object being operated on, while `undefined` is a value that indicates the absence of any object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `object` is a reference to the object being operated on, while `0` is a number value that may not be related to the object being operated on.

DONE.
