  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peek()` returns the value of the next element in the iteration, but `otherIter.next()` advances the iteration to the next element and returns the value of the current element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.next()` advances the iteration to the next element in the `this` iterator, but `otherIter.next()` advances the iteration to the next element in the `other` iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const nextOp = thisIter.next();
otherIter.next(nextOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because `const nextOp = thisIter.next()` advances the iteration to the next element in the `this` iterator, and `otherIter.next(nextOp)` advances the iteration in the `other` iterator to the
