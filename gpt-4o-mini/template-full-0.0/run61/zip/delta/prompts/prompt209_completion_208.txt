Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `delta` object without chopping it, potentially leading to an incorrect representation of the operations if there are any trailing operations that should be removed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.chop(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would chop off the last operation from the `delta`, which may lead to loss of important data that should have been retained in the final result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.chop(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would effectively do nothing to the `delta`, returning it unchanged, which could lead to unexpected results if the intention was to modify the `delta` based on the operations processed.

DONE.
