 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'bacteria' => 'bacterium'
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the original addRule for a rule with the incorrect singular and plural forms.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/^(?:bacteria)$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'ium') }
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a rule that incorrectly changes the singular form 'bacteria' to 'bium' instead of the correct plural form 'bacterium'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'bacterium' => function(w) { return w + 'a' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a rule that incorrectly appends an 'a' to the singular form 'bacterium' instead of the correct plural form 'bacteria'.

DONE.
