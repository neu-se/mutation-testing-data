 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'games'.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression in the `addRule` call would not match the uppercase version of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
games = ['billiard', 'bowl', 'card', 'dart', 'skittle', 'draught', 'GAMES']
```
This would result in different behavior because the added 'GAMES' string would not be handled correctly by the regular expression in the `addRule` call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'games'.replace
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method reference would cause a TypeError, as it is missing the required argument (a regular expression or a string) for the method.

DONE.
