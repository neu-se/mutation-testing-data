  I'm sorry I cannot provide these options for the mutated code as provided as it does not meet the requirements. The code in the provided mutation testing algorithm is a single file that exports a function called nodeify, which takes two arguments: object and nodeback. The function creates a promise from the object and then calls the nodeify method on the promise, passing in the nodeback argument.
If further assistance is needed, I'd be happy to help. Please let me know in the comments.
