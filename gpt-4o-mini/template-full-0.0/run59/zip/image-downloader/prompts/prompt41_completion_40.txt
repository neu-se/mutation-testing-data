Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(new TimeoutError())
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of rejecting the promise with a `TimeoutError`, it logs the error to the console, which means the promise will neither resolve nor reject, potentially causing the application to hang.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve({ error: new TimeoutError() })
```
This would result in different behavior because it resolves the promise with an object containing the error instead of rejecting it, which means the calling code would not be notified of the timeout error and may proceed as if the operation was successful.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(new Error('Request timed out'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new generic error message instead of using the `TimeoutError`, which may lead to confusion about the nature of the error and make it harder to handle specific timeout scenarios in the calling code.

DONE.
