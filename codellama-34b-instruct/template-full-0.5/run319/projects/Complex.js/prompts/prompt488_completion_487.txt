  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__esModule": false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `define` function would not be called, and the `Complex` constructor would not be exported as a module.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__esModule": true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `define` function would be called, but the `Complex` constructor would not be exported as a module.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__esModule": !(typeof define === 'function' && define['amd'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `define` function would be called only if it is a function and the `amd` property is not defined.

DONE.
