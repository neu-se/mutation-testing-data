 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateBearing` method would throw a `TypeError` when trying to access the `latitude` property of `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateBearing` method would treat the empty object as a `GeoPoint` with latitude and longitude of `0`, which would likely yield incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
{ latitude: 0, longitude: 0 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateBearing` method would treat the object as a `GeoPoint` with specific coordinates, which would likely yield incorrect results.

DONE.
