 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because the `isPromiseAlike` function would return `false` for non-promise objects, even if they have a `then` method. The original code checks if the object is an object and if `then` is a function, while this modification would not check if the object is an object.

```javascript

This would result in different behavior because the `isPromiseAlike` function would always return `true` for any object that has a `then` method, even if it's not a promise. The original code checks if the object is an object, while this modification would not check if the object is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript

This would result in different behavior because the `isPromiseAlike` function would always return `true` for any object, since it would wrap the object in
