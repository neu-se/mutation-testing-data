Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1; i < length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because starting the loop index `i` at 1 instead of 0 would skip the first argument in the `args` array, potentially leading to incorrect behavior when the function is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i <= length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because using `<=` instead of `<` would cause the loop to attempt to access an index that is out of bounds of the `arguments` array, which could lead to an `undefined` value being assigned to `args[i]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i < length - 1; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because iterating up to `length - 1` would exclude the last argument from being included in the `args` array, which could lead to missing data when the function is executed.

DONE.
