  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer, "reject"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "reject" verb would cause the generator to throw an error, rather than returning a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer, "resolve"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "resolve" verb would cause the generator to return a fulfilled promise, rather than a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer, "next"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "next" verb would cause the generator to return the next value in the iteration, rather than throwing an error or returning a rejected promise.

DONE.
