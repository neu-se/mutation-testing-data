  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3
```
This would result in different behavior because attempt3 is a different variable than attempt2 and will not have the same stack trace. 

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt4
```
This would result in different behavior because attempt 4 is a different variable than attempt2 and will not have the same stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt5
```
This would result in different behavior because attempt5 is a different variable than attempt2 and will not have the same stack trace.

DONE.
