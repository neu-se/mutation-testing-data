  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```otherIter.peek()```
This would result in different behavior because when using `peek`, the next element in the iterator is returned, rather than advancing the iterator. This would cause the subsequent call to `next` to return the same element, resulting in incorrect behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```otherIter.rest()```
This would result in different behavior because `rest` returns the remaining elements in the iterator, rather than just the next one. This would cause the subsequent call to `next` to return an element that was not intended, resulting in incorrect behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```otherIter.next(2)```
This would result in different behavior because `next` with an argument of 2 would advance the iterator by 2 elements, rather than just 1. This would cause the subsequent call to `next` to return an element that was not intended, resulting in incorrect behavior.

DONE.
