  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.domain !== pageurl.domain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the domains are not equal, rather than equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.domain === pageurl.domain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the domains are equal, rather than not equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.domain.length !== pageurl.domain.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the length of the domains are not equal, rather than equal.

DONE.
