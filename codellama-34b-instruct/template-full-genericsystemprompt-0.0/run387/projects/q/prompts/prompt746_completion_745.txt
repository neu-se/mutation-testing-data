  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `onRejected` is a function that handles the rejection of a promise, whereas `onProgress` is a function that handles the progress of a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `onFulfilled` is a function that handles the fulfillment of a promise, whereas `onProgress` is a function that handles the progress of a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
noop
```
This would result in different behavior because `noop` is a function that does nothing, whereas `onProgress` is a function that handles the progress of a promise.

DONE.
