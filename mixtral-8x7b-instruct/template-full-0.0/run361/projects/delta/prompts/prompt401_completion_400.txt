 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisData || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because if `thisData` is falsy, it will return an empty object instead of `undefined`, which might cause issues if the code relies on `thisData` being `undefined` when it's falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisData['notAnExistingProperty']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access a non-existent property of `thisData`, which would return `undefined` and potentially cause issues if the code expects a specific value or type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisData.concat({ anotherProperty: 'value' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the `thisData` object by adding a new property, which might cause issues if the code relies on the original `thisData` object or its properties.

DONE.
