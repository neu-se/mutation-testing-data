  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice(1)` method would return a substring starting from the second character of the string, instead of the first character as in the original code. This could potentially cause issues with certain inputs, such as strings that start with a number or a special character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice(0, -1)` method would return a substring starting from the first character and ending at the second-to-last character of the string, instead of the first character as in the original code. This could potentially cause issues with certain inputs, such as strings that end with a special character.
