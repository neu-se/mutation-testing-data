  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first character of the `part` string, which is not the intended behavior of the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last character of the `part` string, which is not the intended behavior of the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first and last characters of the `part` string, which is not the intended behavior of the original code fragment.

DONE.
