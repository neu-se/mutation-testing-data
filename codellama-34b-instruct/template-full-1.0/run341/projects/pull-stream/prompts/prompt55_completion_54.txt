  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function is called with `null` instead of the expected argument, which could result in a `TypeError` being thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function is called with a string instead of the expected argument, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("hello")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function is called with a function call as an argument, which could cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
