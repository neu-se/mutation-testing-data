  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'es'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method would return a different substring of `w`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.slice(0, -1) + 'es'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return a different substring of `w`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.split('').reverse().join('') + 'es'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split`, `reverse`, and `join` methods would reorder the characters in `w`.

DONE.
