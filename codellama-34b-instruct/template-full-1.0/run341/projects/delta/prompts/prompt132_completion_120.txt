  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```go
nextOp.invert()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` method would flip the signs of any numbers in the `nextOp` object, potentially causing issues with the code that uses the `nextOp` object later.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```go
nextOp.negate()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `negate` method would negate the value of any numbers in the `nextOp` object, potentially causing issues with the code that uses the `nextOp` object later.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```go
nextOp.fabs()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fabs` method would take the absolute value of any numbers in the `nextOp` object, potentially causing issues with the code that uses the `nextOp` object later.

DONE.
