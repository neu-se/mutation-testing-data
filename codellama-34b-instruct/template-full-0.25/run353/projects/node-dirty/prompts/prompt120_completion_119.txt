  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the number of in-flight writes is less than or equal to 0, while the new code fragment checks if it is strictly less than 0. If the number of in-flight writes is 0, the original code fragment would enter the `if` block, while the new code fragment would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the number of in-flight writes is less than or equal to 0, while the new code fragment checks if it is strictly greater than 0. If the number of in-flight writes is 0, the original code fragment would not enter the `if` block, while the new code fragment would.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
