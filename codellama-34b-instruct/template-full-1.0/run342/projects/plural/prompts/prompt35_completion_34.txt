  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 3
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly calculate the length of the word "thesis" as 3 instead of 4.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly calculate the length of the word "thesis" as 1 instead of 4.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly calculate the length of the word "thesis" as 5 instead of 4.

DONE.
