  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1) * sin(φ2)
```
This code fragment is a buggy version of the original code, as it is missing the `cos` function that is present in the original code. This bug will cause the `calculateBearing` method to return incorrect values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1) * cos(φ2)
```
This code fragment is another buggy version of the original code, as it is missing the `sin` function that is present in the original code. This bug will cause the `calculateBearing` method to return incorrect values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ1) * sin(φ2)
