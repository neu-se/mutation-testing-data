  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because `1` is a truthy value, whereas `0` is a falsy value, and the `!` operator would negate `1` to `false`, causing the `load` event to be emitted with `false` as the argument, which would be a different behavior than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, and the `!` operator would negate `null` to `true`, causing the `load` event to be emitted with `true` as the argument, which would be a different behavior than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, and the `!` operator would negate `undefined` to `true`, causing the `load` event to be emitted
