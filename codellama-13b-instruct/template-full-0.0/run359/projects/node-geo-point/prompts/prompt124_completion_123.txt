  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude, point.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateBearing` method would be calculating the bearing between the latitude and longitude of the `GeoPoint` object and the `point` parameter, rather than the latitude and longitude of the `GeoPoint` object and the `GeoPoint` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.latitude, point.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateBearing` method would be calculating the bearing between the latitude and longitude of the `point` parameter and the `GeoPoint` object, rather than the latitude and longitude of the `GeoPoint` object and the `GeoPoint` object itself.
