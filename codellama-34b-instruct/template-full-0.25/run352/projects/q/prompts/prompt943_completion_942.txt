  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function is not called with the correct arguments. The `defer` function expects a function as its argument, but `null` is passed instead. This would cause the `defer` function to throw an error, which would result in the promise being rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would cause the `defer` function to throw an error, which would result in the promise being rejected instead of resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(Q.defer())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function is
