Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.concat("\n")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append a new array containing a single newline character to the `desiredLines` array instead of joining the lines into a single string, leading to an incorrect format for the stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.join(", ")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would join the lines with a comma and a space instead of a newline, making the stack trace less readable and not following the intended format.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.reverse().join("\n")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the lines before joining them, which could misrepresent the original stack trace order and confuse debugging efforts.

DONE.
