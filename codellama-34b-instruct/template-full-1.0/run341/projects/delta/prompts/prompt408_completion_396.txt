  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.chop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `chop` method is not defined on the `delta` object, so it will throw a `TypeError` when called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property is not defined on the `delta` object, so it will return `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ignore
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ignore` method is not defined on the `delta` object, so it will throw a `TypeError` when called.

DONE.
