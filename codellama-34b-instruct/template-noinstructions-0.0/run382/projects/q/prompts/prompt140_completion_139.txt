  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!p
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `!!p` is a double negation, which would always return a boolean value, while the new code fragment `!p` is a single negation, which would return the opposite boolean value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `!!p` is a double negation, which would always return a boolean value, while the new code fragment `p` would return the value of `p` directly, without any negation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p && !p
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `!!p` is a double negation, which would always return a boolean value, while the new code fragment `p && !p` would return the result of `p` AND NOT `p`, which would always be `false`.

DONE.
