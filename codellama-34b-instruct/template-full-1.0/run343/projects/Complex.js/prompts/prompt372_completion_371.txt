  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the imaginary component `c` instead of the real component `b` in the calculation for the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the real component `a` instead of the imaginary component `b` in the calculation for the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the real and imaginary components of the complex number together, which is not the same as using just the imaginary component `b` in the calculation.

DONE.
