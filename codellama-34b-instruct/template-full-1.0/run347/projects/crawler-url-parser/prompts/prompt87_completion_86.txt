  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used the jQuery `text()` method to get the element's text content, which includes the combined text of all children elements, while the new code uses the `textContent` property of the element, which returns the text content of the element without considering the children.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text(el.text)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used the `text()` method to set the element's text content to the text of the `el` element, while the new code uses the `textContent` property to set the text content of the element, which could result in different behavior if the `el` element has child elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).html(el.text)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used the `text()` method to set the element's text
