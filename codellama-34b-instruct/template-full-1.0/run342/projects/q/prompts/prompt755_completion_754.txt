  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"allResolved"
```
This would result in different behavior because `allResolved` is not a valid keyword in JavaScript and would cause a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"getAll"
```
This would result in different behavior because `getAll` is not a valid keyword in JavaScript and would cause a syntax error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"allSettled"
```
This would result in different behavior because `allSettled` is a function that returns a promise for an array of promises, whereas the original code fragment returns a function.

DONE.
