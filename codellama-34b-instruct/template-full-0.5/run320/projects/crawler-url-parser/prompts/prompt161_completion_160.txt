  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_without_last_part === pageurl_without_last_part
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `==` operator, which checks for value equality, while the new code uses the `===` operator, which checks for value and type equality. This means that the new code would only return "samelevel" if the two URLs have the same value and type, whereas the original code would return "samelevel" if the two URLs have the same value, regardless of their type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_without_last_part !== pageurl_without_last_part
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `!=` operator, which checks for value inequality, while the new code uses the `===` operator, which checks for value and type equality. This means that the new code would return "samelevel" if the two URLs have the same value and type, while the original code would return "samelevel" if the two URLs have different
