  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `arguments` keyword to pass the arguments object to the `array_slice` function, which is not possible with the `null` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `arguments` keyword to pass the arguments object to the `array_slice` function, which is not possible with the `undefined` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `arguments` keyword to pass the arguments object to the `array_slice` function, which is not possible with the `0` value.

DONE.
