  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` creates a shallow copy of the array, whereas `concat()` creates a new array by concatenating the elements of the original array with the elements of the other array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.splice(0, 0, nodeArgs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice()` modifies the original array by removing and/or adding elements, whereas `concat()` creates a new array by concatenating the elements of the original array with the elements of the other array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.push(nodeArgs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `push()` adds elements to the end of the array, whereas `concat()` creates a new array by concatenating the elements of the original array with the elements of the other array.

DONE.
