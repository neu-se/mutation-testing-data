  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.slice()` creates a new array from `args`, whereas `args` is the original array. This could cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses the `args` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.concat()` creates a new array by concatenating `args` with another array, whereas `args` is the original array. This could cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses the `args` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.map(function(x) { return x + 1; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.map()` creates a new array by applying a function to each element of `args`, whereas `args` is the original array. This could cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses the `args` array.

DONE.
