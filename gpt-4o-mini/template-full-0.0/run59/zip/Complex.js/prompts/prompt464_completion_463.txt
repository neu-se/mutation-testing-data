Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because using `Math.ceil` would round `b` up to the nearest integer, potentially changing the sign and value of `b` in the output string representation of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because using `Math.floor` would round `b` down to the nearest integer, which could lead to a different representation of the complex number, especially if `b` is a positive decimal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because negating `b` would change its sign, which would affect the output string representation of the complex number, potentially leading to an incorrect display of the imaginary part.

DONE.
