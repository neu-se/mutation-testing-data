  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(abort || true, done || function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` callback is not being passed to the `read` function, which could cause the stream to not be properly drained.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(abort || true, function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` callback is being replaced with a new function that does not have the same behavior as the original `done` callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(abort || true, done)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` callback is being passed to the `read` function without being wrapped in a function, which could cause the stream to not be properly drained.

DONE.
