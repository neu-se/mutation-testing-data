  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.filter(rule => rule.clone())
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` method returns a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, while `map` method returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.find(rule => rule.clone())
```
This would result in different behavior because `find` method returns the value of the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function, while `map` method returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.slice(0, 1).map(rule => rule.clone())
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` method returns a new array with the specified number of elements from the beginning of the calling array, while `map`
