  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]y$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different from the original, the new pattern doesn't match words that end with "quy".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiou]y$|quy$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern matches words that end with "quy" as well.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]y$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/y$/, 'ies') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different from the original, and the new pattern uses the
