  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', reject
```
This change will cause the promise to reject instead of resolve, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end', resolve
```
This change will cause the promise to resolve when the output stream ends, which is different from the original behavior where the promise resolved when the output stream closed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finish', resolve
```
This change will cause the promise to resolve when the output stream finishes, which is different from the original behavior where the promise resolved when the output stream closed.

DONE.
