  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goos'
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting word "goos" is not a valid English word, and the pluralization function would not be able to handle it correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'geese'
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting word "geese" is not a valid English word, and the pluralization function would not be able to handle it correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose'
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting word "goose" is not a valid English word, and the pluralization function would not be able to handle it correctly.

DONE.
