  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
__filename
```
This will cause the `path.resolve()` method to use the current file's directory as the base path, rather than the directory specified in the `options.dest` property. This could potentially cause the `request()` function to be called with an incorrect path, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(options.dest)
```
This will cause the `path.resolve()` method to use the directory of the `options.dest` property as the base path, rather than the current file's directory. This could potentially cause the `request()` function to be called with an incorrect path, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename(options.dest)
```
This will cause the `path.resolve()` method to use the basename of the `options.dest` property as the base path, rather than the current file's directory. This could potentially cause the `request()` function
