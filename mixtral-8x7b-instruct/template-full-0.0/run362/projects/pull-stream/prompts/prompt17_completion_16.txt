 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly accesses the first argument in the `ref` array, bypassing the common case `switch` statement that handles a small number of pulls.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
read
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `read` variable instead of the `ref[0]` argument, which could lead to unexpected results if the `read` variable has been modified by previous arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pull.apply(null, ref.slice(1))
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the `pull` function with the `ref` array starting from the second element, skipping the first argument. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the first argument is required for the correct functioning of the `pull` function.

DONE.
