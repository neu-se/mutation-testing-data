  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```stackLine.includes```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` check if a substring is present in a string, whereas `indexOf` checks if a string contains a specified value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```stackLine.match```
This would result in different behavior because `match` checks if a string matches a regular expression, whereas `indexOf` checks if a string contains a specified value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```variable != "node.js"```
This would result in different behavior because the `node.js` string is not present in the `stackLine` variable, so the `isNodeFrame` function would return a different value.

DONE.
