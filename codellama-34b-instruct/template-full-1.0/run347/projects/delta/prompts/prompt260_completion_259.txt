  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"ABC".concat(String.fromCharCode("ABC".charCodeAt(0) + 1))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment will check whether two insert operations are equal at an index, while the modified code fragment will return the concatenation of the two strings with a character offset.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"ABC".concat("ABC".repeat(2))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment will check whether two insert operations are equal at an index, while the modified code fragment will return the concatenation of the two strings with a repeated character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"ABC".substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment will check whether two insert operations are equal at an index, while the modified code fragment will return a substring of one character.

DONE.
