  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
destroy
```
This would result in different behavior because `destroy` is a method that destroys the window, whereas `gettype` is a method that retrieves the type of a URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
substring
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring` is a method that returns a substring of a string, whereas `gettype` is a method that retrieves the type of a URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
replace
```
This would result in different behavior because `replace` is a method that replaces occurrences of a string, whereas `gettype` is a method that retrieves the type of a URL.

DONE.
