  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(distance)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment rounds the distance to the nearest integer, while the new code fragment rounds it down to the nearest integer. This could cause the calculated destination point to be different in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil(distance)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment rounds the distance to the nearest integer, while the new code fragment rounds it up to the nearest integer. This could cause the calculated destination point to be different in some cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment rounds the distance to the nearest integer, while the new code fragment uses the distance as is. This could cause the calculated destination point to be different in some cases.

DONE.
