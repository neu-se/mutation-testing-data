  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NULL_CHARACTER
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a value, even if the input value is not a valid embed type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return an empty string, instead of the actual embed type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'UNKNOWN'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a fixed string, instead of the actual embed type.

DONE.
