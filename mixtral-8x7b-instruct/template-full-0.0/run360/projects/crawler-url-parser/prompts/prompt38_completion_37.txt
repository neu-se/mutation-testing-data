 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrlStr, false, true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse()` function's third argument, `parseQueryString`, is set to `false`. This means that the query string in the URL will not be parsed into an object, potentially causing differences in behavior if the code further down the line expects a parsed query string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because the `parse()` function's second argument, `slashesDenoteHost`, is set to `false`. This means that any occurrence of a '/' in the host portion of the URL will be treated as a path separator, potentially causing differences in behavior if the code further down the line expects a correctly formatted host.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrlStr + '', true, true
```
This would result in different behavior because it concatenates an
