  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.emit.bind(this)` creates a new function that is bound to the `this` context of the current function, whereas `this.emit` would emit an event on the `this` context of the function that called it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.emit.call(this)` calls the `emit` method on the `this` context of the current function, whereas `this.emit` would emit an event on the `this` context of the function that called it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit.apply(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.emit.apply(this)` applies the `emit` method on the `this` context of the current function, whereas `this.emit` would emit an event on the
