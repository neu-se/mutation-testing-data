  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] !== ' ' && !isNaN(tokens[i + 1])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next token is not a space and is not NaN, while the new code fragment checks if the next token is not a space and is not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] !== ' ' && tokens[i + 1] !== 'i'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next token is not a space and is not NaN, while the new code fragment checks if the next token is not a space and is not the character 'i'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] !== ' ' && tokens[i + 1] !== 'I'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next token is not a space
