  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `array` refers to the entire array, whereas `array[0]` only refers to the first element of the array. This change would cause the function to only return the first element of the array, instead of iterating through all the elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `array` refers to the entire array, whereas `array.length - 1` refers to the last element of the array. This change would cause the function to return the last element of the array, instead of iterating through all the elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `array` refers to the entire array, whereas `array.slice(1)` refers to the remaining elements of the array starting from the second element. This
