  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(attributes).length
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys(attributes).length` returns the number of keys in the `attributes` object, while `attributes` returns the object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(attributes).length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys(attributes).length > 0` checks if the `attributes` object has any keys, while `attributes` returns the object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(attributes).length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys(attributes).length === 0` checks if the `attributes` object has no keys, while `attributes` returns the object itself.

DONE.
