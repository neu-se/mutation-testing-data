  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {
    throw new Error("This is a buggy implementation of Q");
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error every time the function is called, whereas the original implementation would return a promise that would be resolved or rejected based on the input.
