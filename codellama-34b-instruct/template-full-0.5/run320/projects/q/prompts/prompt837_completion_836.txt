  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method would return a new function with the `this` value bound to `null`, which would likely cause the `onUnhandledError` function to fail when it tries to access properties or methods on the `this` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError.bind(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method would return a new function with the `this` value bound to `undefined`, which would likely cause the `onUnhandledError` function to fail when it tries to access properties or methods on the `this` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError.bind(function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method would return a new function with the `this` value bound to a new function that does nothing, which would
