  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|index|quix/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the new regular expression includes the word "quix," which is not present in the original regular expression. This would cause the regular expression to match the word "quix," which is not intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|index|quix/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the new regular expression includes the global flag "g," which is not present in the original regular expression. This would cause the regular expression to match all occurrences of the word "quix," not just the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|index|quix/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the new regular expression includes the case-insensitive flag "i," which is not present in the original regular expression. This would cause the regular expression to match the word "quix" regardless of case, which is not
