  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would cause the condition to always evaluate to `false`, even if the input is an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isBoxed
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isBoxed` is not a real method in JavaScript, and the code would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isInstanceOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isInstanceOf` is also not a real method in JavaScript, and the code would throw an error.

DONE.
