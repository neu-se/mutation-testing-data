  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would refer to the attributes of the `otherOp` object instead of `thisOp` object, which could cause the program to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would refer to the `insert` property of the `thisOp` object instead of the `attributes` property, which could cause the program to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the program to treat the `attributes` property of `thisOp` as `null`, which could cause the program to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
