 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would not be called on the correct object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
5
```
This would result in different behavior because `5` is not a function and does not have a `dispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {
  // Do nothing
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the function does not contain the `dispatch` method, so it would not be called.

DONE.
