  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, abort, onAbort + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` function is being called with an additional argument, which may cause it to behave differently or produce an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, abort, onAbort.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` function is being bound to a different context, which may cause it to behave differently or produce an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, abort, onAbort.apply(null, [1])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` function is being called with a different set of arguments, which may cause it to behave differently or produce an error.

DONE.
