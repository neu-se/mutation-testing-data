 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
defer(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function expects a resolver object to be passed as the first argument, and not `null`. This would cause the returned promise to never resolve or reject.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
defer({ resolve: function() {}, reject: function() {} });
```
This would result in different behavior because the resolver object passed to `defer` is not created using the `defer` function itself. This would cause the returned promise to never resolve or reject, as the `resolve` and `reject` functions do not have the expected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
defer(true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function expects a resolver object to be passed as the first argument, and not a boolean value. This would cause the returned promise to never resolve or reject, as the resolver object is not created correctly.
