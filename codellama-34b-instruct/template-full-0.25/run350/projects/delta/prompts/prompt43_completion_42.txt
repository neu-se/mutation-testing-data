  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `diff` function would be called with the `NULL_CHARACTER` constant, which is a non-zero value, instead of the expected zero value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `diff` function would be called with a negative value, which would cause the function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `diff` function would be called with a non-numeric value, which would cause the function to return a different result.

DONE.
