  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^$/)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match the beginning of the string, but not the end, so it would not detect if the string is empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.*$/)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any character (including the empty string) at the beginning and end of the string, so it would not detect if the string is empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any character (including the empty string) at the beginning and end of the string, so it would not detect if the string is empty.

DONE.
