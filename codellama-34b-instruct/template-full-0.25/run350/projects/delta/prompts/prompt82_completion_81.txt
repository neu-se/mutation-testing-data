  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = 'foo';
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` property of `newOp` would be set to the string `'foo'`, instead of the original value of `arg`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = { foo: 'bar' };
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attributes` property of `newOp` would be set to the object `{ foo: 'bar' }`, instead of the original value of `attributes`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.delete = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` property of `newOp` would be set to `0`, instead of the original value of `length`.

DONE.
