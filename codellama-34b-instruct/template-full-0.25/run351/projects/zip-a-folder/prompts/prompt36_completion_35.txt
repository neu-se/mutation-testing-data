  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.on('error', reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only listens for the 'close' event, while this new code fragment listens for both the 'close' and 'error' events.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.on('finish', resolve);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only listens for the 'close' event, while this new code fragment listens for both the 'close' and 'finish' events.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.on('end', resolve);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only listens for the 'close' event, while this new code fragment listens for both the 'close' and 'end' events.

DONE.
