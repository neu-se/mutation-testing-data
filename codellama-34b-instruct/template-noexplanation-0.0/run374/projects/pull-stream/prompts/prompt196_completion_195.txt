  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if `abort` is not defined or is `false`. This will result in the `read` function being called with `abort` as the first argument, which may cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && true
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if `abort` is not defined or is `false`. This will result in the `read` function being called with `abort` as the first argument, which may cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || false
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if `abort` is defined and is `true`. This will result in the `read` function being called with `null` as the first argument, which may
