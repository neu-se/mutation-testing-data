  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a new array with the first element removed, whereas the original code fragment would return the original `arguments` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(promises, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a new array with the first element removed, whereas the original code fragment would return the original `promises` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(deferred.promise, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a new array with the first element removed, whereas the original code fragment would return the original `deferred.promise` object.

DONE.
