  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise.then(function() { return null; });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would continue to iterate over the promise, while the modified code fragment would only iterate over the resolved value of the promise (which is `null` in this case).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise.catch(function() { return null; });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would continue to iterate over the promise, while the modified code fragment would only iterate over the rejected value of the promise (which is `null` in this case).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise.then(function() { throw new Error(); });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would continue to iterate over the promise, while the modified code fragment would only iterate over the error value of the promise (which is an `Error` object in this case).

DONE.
