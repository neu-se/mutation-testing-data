  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^FEFF/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match a different pattern than the original code fragment. The original code fragment is written as /^\uFEFF/, '' which matches the UTF-8 byte order mark (BOM) at the start of a string. The modified code fragment would match the string "FEFF" anywhere in the string, not just at the start.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\u2028/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match a different pattern than the original code fragment. The original code fragment is written as /^\uFEFF/, '' which matches the UTF-8 BOM at the start of a string. The modified code fragment would match the string "U+2028" at the start of a string, which is a different byte order mark (BOM).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^FEFF/g
```
This would result in different
