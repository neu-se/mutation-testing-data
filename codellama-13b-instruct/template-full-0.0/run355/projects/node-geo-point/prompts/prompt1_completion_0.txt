  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof latitude !== 'number' || typeof longitude !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if both latitude and longitude are numbers, while the new code fragment only checks if latitude is a number. This could potentially cause issues if the longitude is not a number, but the original code would not have caught this.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
latitude < -90 || latitude > 90 || longitude < -180 || longitude > 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if latitude and longitude are within the valid range of -90 to 90 degrees and -180 to 180 degrees, while the new code fragment checks if latitude and longitude are within a broader range of -90 to 90 degrees and -180 to 180 degrees. This could potentially cause issues if the latitude and longitude are outside of the broader range, but the original code would not have caught this.
