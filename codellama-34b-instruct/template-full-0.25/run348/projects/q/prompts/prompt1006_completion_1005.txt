  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would be called on `null` instead of `object`, which would likely throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would be called on `undefined` instead of `object`, which would likely throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would be called on an empty object `{}` instead of `object`, which would likely throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
