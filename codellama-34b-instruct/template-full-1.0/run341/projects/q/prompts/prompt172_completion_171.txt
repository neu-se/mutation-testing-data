  

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`isNodeFrame(stackLine)` can be replaced with `true`.
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would no longer check for Node frames, and the resulting filtered stack trace would be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`isInternalFrame(stackLine)` can be replaced with `false`.
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would no longer filter out internal traces, and the resulting filtered stack trace would be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`stackLine.indexOf(':')` can be replaced with `-1`.
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would no longer check for a colon in the line, and the resulting filtered stack trace would be incorrect.

DONE.
