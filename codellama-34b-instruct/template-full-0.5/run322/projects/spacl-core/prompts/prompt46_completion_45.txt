  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.split
```
This would result in different behavior because `split` is a method that returns an array of substrings, whereas `match` is a method that returns an array of matches.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` is a method that checks if a substring is present in a string, whereas `match` is a method that checks if a pattern is present in a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` is a method that returns the index of the first occurrence of a substring in a string, whereas `match` is a method that returns an array of matches.

DONE.
