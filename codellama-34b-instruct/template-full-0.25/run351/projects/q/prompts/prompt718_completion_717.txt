  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys` method would return a promise for an array with a single element, instead of an empty array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys` method would return a promise for an array with an `undefined` element, instead of an empty array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[null]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys` method would return a promise for an array with a `null` element, instead of an empty array.

DONE.
