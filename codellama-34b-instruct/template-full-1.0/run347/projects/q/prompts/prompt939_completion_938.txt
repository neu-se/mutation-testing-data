  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs + array_slice(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because the spread operator (`...`) is missing from the concatenation, which would cause the arguments to be joined together rather than being spread into an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs + Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a different method (`Array.prototype.slice.call()`) to convert the arguments into an array, which may have different behavior in certain cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs + Object.keys(arguments).map(function (key) { return arguments[key]; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a different method (`Object.keys()`) to iterate over the arguments, and returns a new array with the argument values, rather than a concatenation of the `baseArgs` and the `arguments` array.

DONE.
