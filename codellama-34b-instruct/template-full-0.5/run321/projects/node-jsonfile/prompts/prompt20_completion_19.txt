  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options.encoding` property is not always defined, and it may cause the `readFileSync` function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.throws
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options.throws` property is not always defined, and it may cause the `readFileSync` function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.reviver
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options.reviver` property is not always defined, and it may cause the `JSON.parse` function to throw an error.

DONE.
