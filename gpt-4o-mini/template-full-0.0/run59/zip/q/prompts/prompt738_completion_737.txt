Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("No promises were provided."));
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of resolving with a value when no promises are present, it would reject the promise with an error, changing the expected outcome of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with `undefined` instead of resolving it with a promise that represents the value of the first fulfilled promise, which could lead to unexpected results in promise chaining.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve("default value");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with a static string "default value" instead of waiting for any of the promises to resolve, which could mislead the caller about the actual state of the promises being processed.

DONE.
