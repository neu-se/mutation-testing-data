Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, distance + 1000, bearing
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1000 meters to the distance, which would cause the calculated destination to be further away than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, distance, bearing + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 180 degrees to the bearing, effectively calculating the destination point in the opposite direction, which would yield a completely different location.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, distance, -bearing
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the bearing, which would change the direction of the destination point, leading to an incorrect calculation of the new location.

DONE.
