  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(utcOffset)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getOffsetStr` function with the `utcOffset` argument, which would return a string representation of the offset, but the original code fragment was calling the `getOffsetStr` function with the `dstOffset` argument, which would return a different string representation of the offset.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(dstOffset)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getOffsetStr` function with the `dstOffset` argument, which would return a string representation of the offset, but the original code fragment was calling the `getOffsetStr` function with the `utcOffset` argument, which would return a different string representation of the offset.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(utcOffset + dstOffset)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getOffsetStr` function with
