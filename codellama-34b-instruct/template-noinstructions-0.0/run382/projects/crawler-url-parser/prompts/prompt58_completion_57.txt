  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would return `null` instead of a parsed URL object, which would cause the `extract` function to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would return a parsed URL object, but the `extract` function would still fail because the `baseUrl` variable is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would return a parsed URL object, and the `extract` function would use the `baseUrl` variable to resolve the URL, but the `baseUrl` variable is not defined.

DONE.
