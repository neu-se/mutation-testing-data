  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.lastIndexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastIndexOf` returns the last index at which a given element can be found in the array, whereas `indexOf` returns the first index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` returns a boolean indicating whether an element is present in the array, whereas `indexOf` returns the first index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.findIndex
```
This would result in different behavior because `findIndex` returns the index of the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function, whereas `indexOf` returns the first index.

DONE.
