  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(θ + 360) % 360
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code, but it adds 360 to the angle before taking the modulo 360. This will result in a different bearing value, but it will still be within the range of 0 to 360 degrees.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(θ + 180) % 360
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code, but it adds 180 to the angle before taking the modulo 360. This will result in a different bearing value, but it will still be within the range of 0 to 360 degrees.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(θ + 90) % 360
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code, but it adds 90 to the angle before taking the modulo 360. This
