  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` values would be passed as arguments to the `then` method, which would cause the promise to be fulfilled with a value of `null` instead of the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, undefined, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` values would be passed as arguments to the `then` method, which would cause the promise to be fulfilled with a value of `undefined` instead of the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, void 0, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the `void 0` values would be passed as arguments to the `then` method, which would cause the promise to be fulfilled with a value of `undefined` instead of the original value.

DONE.
