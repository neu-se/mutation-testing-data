  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect !== void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, which means that if `inspect` is not strictly equal to `void 0`, the code would enter the `if` block and execute the code inside it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, which means that if `inspect` is strictly equal to `null`, the code would enter the `if` block and execute the code inside it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, which means that if `inspect` is not strictly equal to `null`, the code would enter the `if` block and execute the code inside it.

DONE.
