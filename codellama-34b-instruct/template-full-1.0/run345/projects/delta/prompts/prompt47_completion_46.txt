  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```a + b```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the operands `a` and `b` instead of replacing them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```a - b```
This would result in different behavior because it subtracts `b` from `a` instead of replacing `a` with `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```a * b```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies `a` and `b` instead of replacing `a` with `b`.

DONE.
