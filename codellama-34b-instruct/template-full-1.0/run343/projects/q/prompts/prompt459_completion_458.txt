  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `unhandledRejections` is a different variable than `unhandledRejected`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises
```
This would result in different behavior because `promises` is a different variable than `unhandledRejections`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejected` is a different variable than `unhandledRejections`.

DONE.
