  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function would not be called, and the promise would be resolved instead of rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("test")
```
This would result in different behavior because an error would be thrown instead of calling the `rejected` function, and the promise would be rejected with the error instead of being resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function would not be called, and the promise would be resolved with `undefined` instead of being rejected.

DONE.
