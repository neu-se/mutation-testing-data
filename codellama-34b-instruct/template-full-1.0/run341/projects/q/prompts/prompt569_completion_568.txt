  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment refers to the `errback` function, which is not defined in the provided code snippet. If the `errback` function is replaced with `null`, it would cause a `TypeError` when the `Q.done` method tries to call it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment refers to the `errback` function, which is not defined in the provided code snippet. If the `errback` function is replaced with `undefined`, it would cause a `TypeError` when the `Q.done` method tries to call it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment refers to the `errback` function, which is not defined in the provided code snippet. If the `errback` function is replaced with an empty function, it would not cause any
