  Sure, I can help you with that! Please keep in mind that these are just suggestions and may not necessarily result in different behavior.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
else if (deprecated && tzs[key]) Object.assign(prev, { [key]: tzs[key] });
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.assign()` would only be called if `deprecated && tzs[key]` are both truthy, whereas the original code would call `Object.assign()` regardless of the value of `deprecated`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
prev = Object.assign(prev, { [key]: tzs[key] });
```
This would result in different behavior because `prev` would be reassigned rather than being modified in place, which could affect the flow of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
prev = Object.assign({}, prev, { [key]: tzs[key] });
```
