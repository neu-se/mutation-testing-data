  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(version === '1' || version === '1.0'
      ? /[*+][^/]|[^/][*+]/
      : /\*[^*/]|\+[^+/]|[^/*]\*|[^/+]\+|\*\*\*|\+\+\+/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and it would not match the same strings as the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(version === '1' || version === '1.0'
      ? /[*+][^/]|[^/][*+]/
      : /\*[^*/]|\+[^+/]|[^/*]\*|[^/+]\+|\*\*\*|\+\+\+/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is the same, but the operator is different, so it would match the opposite set of strings.

Option 3
