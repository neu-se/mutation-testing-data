  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ses !== "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because in this case, the code would check if ses is not an object, whereas in the original code, it checks if it is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ses !== "boolean"
```
This would result in different behavior because in this case, the code would check if ses is not a boolean, whereas in the original code, it checks if it is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ses !== "number"
```
This would result in different behavior because in this case, the code would check if ses is not a number, whereas in the original code, it checks if it is undefined.

DONE.
