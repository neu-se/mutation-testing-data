  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was 'geese', which is the plural form of 'goose', and the new code fragment is 'goose', which is the singular form of 'goose'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'gooses'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was 'geese', which is the plural form of 'goose', and the new code fragment is 'gooses', which is an incorrect plural form of 'goose'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'gese'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was 'geese', which is the plural form of 'goose', and the new code fragment is 'gese', which is a misspelling of the word 'geese'.

DONE.
