  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits the `'load'` event with the actual number of loaded keys, while this replacement emits the event with a fixed value of 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', this._data.size + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits the `'load'` event with the actual number of loaded keys, while this replacement emits the event with a value that is one more than the actual number of loaded keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', this._data.size - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits the `'load'` event with the actual number of loaded keys, while this replacement emits the event with a value that is one less than the actual number of loaded keys.

DONE.
