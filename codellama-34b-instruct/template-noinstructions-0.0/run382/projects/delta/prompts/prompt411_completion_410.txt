  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasNext()` is a method that returns a boolean indicating whether there are more ops in the iterator, whereas `hasNext` is a property that returns the next op in the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `next()` is a method that returns the next op in the iterator, whereas `next` is a property that returns the next op in the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek()` is a method that returns the next op in the iterator without advancing the iterator, whereas `peek` is a property that returns the next op in the iterator and advances the iterator.

DONE.
