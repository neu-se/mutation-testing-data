  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the existence of the `country` variable, while this new code fragment checks for the value of `country` to be `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the existence of the `country` variable, while this new code fragment checks for the value of `country` to be not `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the existence of the `country` variable, while this new code fragment checks for the length of `country` to be 0.

DONE.
