  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Buffer.isBuffer
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of `Buffer.isBuffer`, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if `content` is not a buffer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Buffer.isBuffer && !content
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator combines the result of `Buffer.isBuffer` and `!content`, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if `content` is a buffer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Buffer.isBuffer || content
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator combines the result of `Buffer.isBuffer` and `content`, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if `content` is not a buffer.

DONE.
