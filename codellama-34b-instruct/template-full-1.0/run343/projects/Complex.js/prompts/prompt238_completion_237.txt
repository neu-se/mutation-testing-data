  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the sign of the imaginary part, effectively multiplying the complex number by -1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increase the real part of the complex number by 1, effectively shifting the value on the real axis.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the magnitude of the imaginary part, effectively shrinking or expanding the complex number.

DONE.
