  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
      if (typeof thisOp.retain === 'object' && thisOp.retain !== null) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the new condition checks for an object `retain` property rather than a string or number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
      if (typeof thisOp.retain === 'boolean') {
```
This would result in different behavior because the new condition checks for a boolean `retain` property rather than a string or number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
      if (typeof thisOp.retain === 'number' && thisOp.retain > 10) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the new condition checks for a numeric `retain` property with a value greater than 10, rather than just checking for any number.

DONE.
