 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_progressed` function is not being called with the correct `value`. Instead, an immediately resolved promise is being passed, which would change the behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_progressed` function expects a function reference, and `null` would cause a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
42
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_progressed` function expects a function reference, and an integer would cause a `TypeError`.

DONE.
