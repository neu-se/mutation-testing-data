  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty(object, key) && typeof object[key] !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if `object` has a property with the given `key`, but the modified code fragment also checks if the property is defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty(object, key) || typeof object[key] === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if `object` has a property with the given `key`, but the modified code fragment also checks if the property is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty(object, key) !== typeof object[key] !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if `object` has a property with the given `key`, but the modified code fragment also checks if the property is defined or not
