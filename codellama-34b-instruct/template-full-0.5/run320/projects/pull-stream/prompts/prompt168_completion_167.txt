  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort()
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort` is a function, and calling it would execute the code inside the function, which may have unintended consequences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a method that allows calling a function with a specific `this` value, and passing `null` as the `this` value would change the context of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` is similar to `call`, but it allows passing an array of arguments to the function, which could also affect the behavior.

DONE.
