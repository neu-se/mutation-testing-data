  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `stripBom(data)` would remove the UTF-8 BOM from the data, while the new code fragment `data = null` would set the data to null, which would cause the JSON.parse method to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data = 'null'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `stripBom(data)` would remove the UTF-8 BOM from the data, while the new code fragment `data = 'null'` would set the data to the string 'null', which would cause the JSON.parse method to return null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data = JSON.parse(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `stripBom(data)` would remove the UTF-8 BOM from the data, while the new code fragment `data = JSON.parse(data
