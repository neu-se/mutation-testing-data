  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/thesis|crisis/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'es' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a regular expression with a capturing group, but the new code fragment does not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/thesis|crisis/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'es' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a regular expression with a capturing group, but the new code fragment does not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/thesis|crisis/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 3) + 'es' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a regular expression with a capturing
