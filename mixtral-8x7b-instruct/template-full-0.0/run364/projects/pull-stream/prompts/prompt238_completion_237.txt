 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called with `null` as the `end` argument instead of the boolean value `end`. This could cause issues if the `cb` function is not equipped to handle `null` values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
5
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called with a fixed value of `5` as the `end` argument, instead of the value returned by the `read` function. This could cause issues if the `cb` function is expecting a variable value for `end`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data, 'extra argument')
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument `'extra argument'` is being passed to the `cb` function. This could cause issues if the `cb` function is not designed to handle this extra argument.

DONE.
