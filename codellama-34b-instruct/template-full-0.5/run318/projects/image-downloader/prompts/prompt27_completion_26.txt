  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest = path.join(options.dest, 'image.jpg');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the string 'image.jpg' as the destination file name, regardless of the actual file name of the downloaded image.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest = path.join(options.dest, path.basename(options.url));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the file name of the URL as the destination file name, regardless of the actual file name of the downloaded image.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest = path.join(options.dest, Math.random().toString(36).substring(7));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a random file name as the destination file name, regardless of the actual file name of the downloaded image.

DONE.
