  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, undefined, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `progressed` function to be called with `undefined` as its first argument, which may cause it to behave differently than when it is called with the expected `value` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `progressed` function to be called with `null` as its first argument, which may cause it to behave differently than when it is called with the expected `value` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}, function () {}, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `progressed` function to be called with a different `this` context, which may cause it to behave differently than when it is called with the expected `this` context.

DONE.
