  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `array_slice.reverse()` is a function that reverses the order of the elements in an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.concat(array_slice)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.concat(array_slice)` would create a new array that is the concatenation of the original array and itself, resulting in a larger array with duplicate values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.filter(function(x) { return x !== undefined; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.filter(function(x) { return x !== undefined; })` would create a new array that contains only the elements of the original array that are not `undefined`, resulting in a smaller array with fewer values
