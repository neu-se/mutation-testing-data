  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.expm1(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a` parameter would be passed to `Math.expm1` instead of `a + b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.expm1(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b` parameter would be passed to `Math.expm1` instead of `a + b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.expm1(a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a + b` expression would be passed to `Math.expm1` instead of just `a`.

DONE.
