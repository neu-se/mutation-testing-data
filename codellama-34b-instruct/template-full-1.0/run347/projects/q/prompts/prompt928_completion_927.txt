  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` and `slice` are two different array methods in JavaScript, and while they both extract a sections of an array, they have different syntax and behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat(array_slice(arguments, 2))
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` method creates a new array by merging two or more arrays, while `array_slice` returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.assign(array_slice(arguments, 2))
```
This would result in different behavior because `assign` method is used to copy the values of all enumerable own properties from one or more source objects to a target object, while `array_slice` returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array.

DONE.
