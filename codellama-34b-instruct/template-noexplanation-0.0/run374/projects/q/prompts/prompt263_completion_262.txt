  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(value)
```
This change will cause the `fulfill` method to be called instead of `reject`, which will result in the promise being fulfilled instead of rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfill(undefined)
```
This change will cause the `fulfill` method to be called with `undefined` as the value, which will result in the promise being fulfilled with a value of `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfill(null)
```
This change will cause the `fulfill` method to be called with `null` as the value, which will result in the promise being fulfilled with a value of `null`.

DONE.
