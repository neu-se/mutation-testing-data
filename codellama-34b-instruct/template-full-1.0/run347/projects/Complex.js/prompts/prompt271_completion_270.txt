  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan` and `Math.atan2` have different implementations and may produce different results for certain input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b / c
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `a + b / c` is a different formula than `Math.atan2(a, c)` and would produce different results for certain input values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b / c
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `a - b / c` is a different formula than `Math.atan2(a, c)` and would produce different results for certain input values.

DONE.
