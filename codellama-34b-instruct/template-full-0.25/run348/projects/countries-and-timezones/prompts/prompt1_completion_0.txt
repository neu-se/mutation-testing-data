  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `name` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `name` is strictly equal to `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `name` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `name` is an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!name.trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `name` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `name` is an empty string after removing any leading or trailing whitespace characters.

DONE.
