Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because using the sine function instead of the cosine function will alter the calculation of the y-component in the distance formula, leading to incorrect distance results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because using the tangent function instead of the cosine function will significantly change the mathematical relationship being calculated, resulting in incorrect distance calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(90)
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing the cosine function with a constant value (0) will cause the calculation to ignore the actual longitude difference, leading to incorrect distance results.

DONE.
