  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `null` when the `data` argument is not defined, while `undefined` would return `undefined` instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `null` when the `data` argument is not defined, while `false` would return `false` instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `null` when the `data` argument is not defined, while `0` would return the number 0 instead.

DONE.
