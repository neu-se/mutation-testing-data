  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```    
!(abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` is not a boolean value, so it would always evaluate to `true` when negated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 abort || true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true`, regardless of the value of `abort`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 abort -> true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true`, regardless of the value of `abort`.

DONE.
