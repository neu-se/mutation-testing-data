 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size === 0 && this._waitForDrain
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the exact opposite condition, which would cause the function to return when it should continue executing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this._queue.size && !this._waitForDrain
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for both conditions to be false, which would cause the function to return when it should continue executing if either condition is true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.length > 0 || this._waitForDrain
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the opposite condition for `this._queue.size`, and also checks for `this._waitForDrain` to be true, which would cause the function to return when it should continue executing.

DONE.
