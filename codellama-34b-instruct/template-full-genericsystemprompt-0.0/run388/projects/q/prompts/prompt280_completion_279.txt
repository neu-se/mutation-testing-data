  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the arguments array to the `array_slice` function, which would return a new array containing all elements of the original array except for the first one. This would cause the `become` function to receive a different set of arguments, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the arguments array to the `array_slice` function, which would return a new array containing all elements of the original array except for the first two. This would cause the `become` function to receive a different set of arguments, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the arguments array to the `array_slice` function, which would return
