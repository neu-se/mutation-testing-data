  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.foo
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.foo` is not a function and would throw a `TypeError` when called, whereas `prop` is a function and would not throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.bar
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.bar` is not a function and would throw a `TypeError` when called, whereas `prop` is a function and would not throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.baz
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.baz` is not a function and would throw a `TypeError` when called, whereas `prop` is a function and would not throw an error.

DONE.
