  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is called with the `end` and `data` arguments, which would cause the stream to end prematurely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is called with the `null` and `data` arguments, which would cause the stream to end prematurely and return the `data` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is called with the `end` and `null` arguments, which would cause the stream to end prematurely and return `null`.

DONE.
