  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 && b === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition `b === 1` would always evaluate to `false` when `b` is equal to `0`, which is the value it is initialized to in the function. This would cause the function to return a different value than it would with the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 && b === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition `b === -1` would always evaluate to `false` when `b` is equal to `0`, which is the value it is initialized to in the function. This would cause the function to return a different value than it would with the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 && b === 0.5
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition `b === 0.5` would always evaluate to `false` when `b
