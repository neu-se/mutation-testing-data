  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] + this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment subtracts the imaginary part of `this` from the imaginary part of `z`, while this new code fragment adds them together.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] * this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment subtracts the imaginary part of `this` from the imaginary part of `z`, while this new code fragment multiplies them together.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] / this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment subtracts the imaginary part of `this` from the imaginary part of `z`, while this new code fragment divides the imaginary part of `z` by the imaginary part of `this`.

DONE.
