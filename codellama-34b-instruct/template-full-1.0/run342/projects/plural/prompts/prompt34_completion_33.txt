  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method with a negative value for `end` will return the entire string from the splitting point to the end of the string, whereas the original implementation used `0` as the start index, which would include the character at the splitting point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method with a positive value for `start` will return the entire string from the splitting point to the end of the string, whereas the original implementation used `0` as the start index, which would include the character at the splitting point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method with a non-negative value for `start` will return the entire string from the splitting point to the end of the string, whereas the original implementation used `0` as the start index, which would include the character at the splitting point.
