  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= length
```
This would result in different behavior because the while loop would continue one extra time, causing an off-by-one error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > length
```
This would result in different behavior because the while loop would never execute, causing the program to miss some essential functionality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length >= 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop condition would no longer be based on the length of the array, but on a hardcoded value. This would result in either too much or too little iteration, depending on the initial value of length.

DONE.
