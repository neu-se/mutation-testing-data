  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because `clear()` removes all elements from the map, whereas `delete` removes a specific element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because `set()` sets the value of the map at the given key, whereas `delete` removes the key-value pair from the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.size--;
```
This would result in different behavior because `size` is a property that returns the number of elements in the map, and decrementing it would cause the map to appear smaller than it actually is.

DONE.
