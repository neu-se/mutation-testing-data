  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get("tail")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method is called on the `ends.promise` object, which is a `Q.defer` object, and not on the `ends` object, which is a `Q.defer` object. This would cause the `get` method to return a different value, which could affect the behavior of the `Queue` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get("head")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method is called on the `ends.promise` object, which is a `Q.defer` object, and not on the `ends` object, which is a `Q.defer` object. This would cause the `get` method to return a different value, which could affect the behavior of the `Queue` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.
