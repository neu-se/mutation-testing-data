 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [country]: { current: [id], all: [id] } }
```
This would result in different behavior because it initializes the current and all arrays with the specific id instead of empty arrays.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [country]: { current: result.all, all: result.all } }
