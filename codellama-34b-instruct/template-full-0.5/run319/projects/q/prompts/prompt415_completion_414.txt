  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator inverts the boolean value of `isPromise`, so if the original code fragment would have returned `true`, the modified code fragment would return `false`, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` is a different function that checks if an object is a promise-like object, which may have different behavior than `isPromise` depending on the implementation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFulfilled` checks if a promise is fulfilled, which may have different behavior than `isPromise` depending on the implementation.

DONE.
