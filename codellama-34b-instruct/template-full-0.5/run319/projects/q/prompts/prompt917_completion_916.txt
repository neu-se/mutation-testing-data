  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end. In this case, the `nodeArgs` array is used to pass arguments to a function, and the order of the arguments may be important.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes an element from the end of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end. In this case, the `nodeArgs` array is used to pass arguments to a function, and the order of the arguments may be important.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` removes an element from the beginning of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end. In this case, the `nodeArgs` array is used to pass arguments to a
