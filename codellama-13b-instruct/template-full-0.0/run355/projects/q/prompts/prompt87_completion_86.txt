  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f()
```
This would result in different behavior because the function call would be made immediately, rather than being deferred until the next tick.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because the function call would be made with a different context, which could affect the behavior of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f.apply()
```
This would result in different behavior because the function call would be made with a different context and a different set of arguments, which could affect the behavior of the function.

DONE.
