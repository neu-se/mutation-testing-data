  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read || typeof read.source === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator will always return `true` if the left-hand side is truthy, whereas the `&&` operator will only return `true` if both operands are truthy. This could cause the `read.source` property to be accessed even if `read` is falsy, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read ? typeof read.source === 'function' : false
```
This would result in different behavior because the ternary operator will only evaluate the second operand if the first operand is truthy. In the original code, `read && typeof read.source === 'function'` will only evaluate `read.source` if `read` is truthy, which is not the case with this replacement. This could cause the `read.source` property to be accessed even if `read` is falsy, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 3:
