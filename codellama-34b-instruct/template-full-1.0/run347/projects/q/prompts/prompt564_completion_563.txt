  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that rejects the promise with a reason, while `resolve` is a function that resolves the promise with a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw
```
This would result in different behavior because `continue` is a keyword that continues the execution of the current loop, while `throw` is a statement that throws an exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return
```
This would result in different behavior because `continue` is a keyword that continues the execution of the current loop, while `return` is a statement that returns a value from a function.

DONE.
