  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ReturnValue === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ReturnValue` is not undefined, while this replacement checks if it is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ReturnValue !== "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ReturnValue` is not an object, while this replacement checks if it is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ReturnValue === "string"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ReturnValue` is not a string, while this replacement checks if it is a string.

DONE.
