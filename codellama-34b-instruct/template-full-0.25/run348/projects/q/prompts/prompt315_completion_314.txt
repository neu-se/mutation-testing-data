  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fallback === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, and `void 0` is a non-primitive value. In the original code, `fallback` is expected to be a function, and `void 0` is used to indicate that it is not provided. If `fallback` is replaced with `null`, it would be considered a function, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fallback === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value, and `void 0` is a non-primitive value. In the original code, `fallback` is expected to be a function, and `void 0` is used to indicate that it is not provided. If `fallback` is replaced with `undefined`, it would be considered a function, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fallback === function()
