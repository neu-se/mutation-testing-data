  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.length` is a number, and `array_slice` is a function, so it would cause a `TypeError` when trying to call the `apply` method on it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
+array_slice
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator coerces `array_slice` to a string, so it would not cause a `TypeError` but it would have a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice[0]` is a function, so it would cause a `TypeError` when trying to call the `apply` method on it.

DONE.
