  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` property is not defined on the `otherOp` object, so it would return `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property is not defined on the `otherOp` object, so it would return `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attributes` property is not defined on the `otherOp` object, so it would return `undefined`.

DONE.
