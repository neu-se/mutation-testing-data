 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
z['re'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the real part of the complex number is equal to infinity, instead of checking if the complex number is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns true, causing the 'INFINITY' value to be returned regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
z.isInfinite()
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to call the 'isInfinite' method on the complex number object 'z', but the method does not exist, causing a TypeError.

DONE.
