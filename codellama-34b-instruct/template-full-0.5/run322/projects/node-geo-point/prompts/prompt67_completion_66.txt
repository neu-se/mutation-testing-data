  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-y
```
This would result in different behavior because the minus sign would cause the result of the `atan2` function to be negated, which would change the direction of the bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would add 1 to the result of the `atan2` function, which would change the direction of the bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would multiply the result of the `atan2` function by 2, which would change the direction of the bearing.

DONE.
