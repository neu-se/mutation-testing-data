  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType.includes('delete')
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes()` checks if a string contains a particular value, while `===` checks for strict equality. In this case, if `nextType` is an array, `includes()` would return `true` if the array contains the string `'delete'`, while `===` would only return `true` if `nextType` is exactly equal to the string `'delete'`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType != 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because `!=` checks for inequality, while `===` checks for strict equality. In this case, if `nextType` is not exactly equal to the string `'delete'`, `!=` would return `true`, while `===` would return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType !== 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because `!==` checks for strict inequality, which means it
