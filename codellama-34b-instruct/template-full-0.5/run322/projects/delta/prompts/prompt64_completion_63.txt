  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.push
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the newOp object onto the ops array, but it would not return the this object, which is what the original code fragment does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the newOp object to the beginning of the ops array, but it would not return the this object, which is what the original code fragment does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(0, 0, newOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the newOp object to the beginning of the ops array, but it would not return the this object, which is what the original code fragment does.

DONE.
