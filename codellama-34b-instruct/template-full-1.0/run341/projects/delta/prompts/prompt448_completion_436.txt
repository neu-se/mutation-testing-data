  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.type
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.type` is not the same as `op`, as `op.type` is a different property of the `Op` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.size
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.size` is not the same as `op`, as `op.size` is a different property of the `Op` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.value
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.value` is not the same as `op`, as `op.value` is a different property of the `Op` object.

DONE.
