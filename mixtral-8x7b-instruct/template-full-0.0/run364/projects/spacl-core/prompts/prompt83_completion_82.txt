 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` for `matches` method, regardless of the rule's `matches` result, since an empty object is always truthy in JavaScript.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` for `matches` method, since an empty array is falsy in JavaScript.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` for `matches` method, since the number 1 is truthy in JavaScript.

DONE.
