  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag would cause the regular expression to be applied globally, potentially matching more than one instance of the pattern in the input string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag would cause the regular expression to be case-insensitive, potentially matching a different set of characters than the original pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/m
```
This would result in different behavior because the `m` flag would cause the regular expression to be applied in multi-line mode, potentially matching the start of a line that is not the start of the input string.

DONE.
