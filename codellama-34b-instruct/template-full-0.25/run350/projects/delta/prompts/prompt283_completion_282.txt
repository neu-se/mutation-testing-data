  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `length` is a property that returns the number of elements in a string, whereas `indexOf` is a method that returns the position of the first occurrence of a specified value in a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert.charAt(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `charAt(0)` returns the first character of a string, whereas `indexOf` returns the position of the first occurrence of a specified value in a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert.includes('a')
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` returns a boolean indicating whether a specified value is present in a string, whereas `indexOf` returns the position of the first occurrence of a specified value in a string.

DONE.
