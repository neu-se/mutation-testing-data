  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(sourceUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function is called with a different argument, which could result in different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(sourceUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse` function is called with a different argument, which could result in different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(sourceUrl, true, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse` function is called with different options, which could result in different output.

DONE.
