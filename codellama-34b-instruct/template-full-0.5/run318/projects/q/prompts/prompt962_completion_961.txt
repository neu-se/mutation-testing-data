  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `arguments` object and the `0` index to retrieve the first argument passed to the function, while the modified code fragment is using the `arguments` object and the `1` index to retrieve the second argument passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `arguments` object and the `0` index to retrieve the first argument passed to the function, while the modified code fragment is using the `args` array and the `length` property to retrieve the number of arguments passed to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `arguments` object and the `0` index to retrieve the first argument passed to the function, while the modified code fragment is using the `args` array
