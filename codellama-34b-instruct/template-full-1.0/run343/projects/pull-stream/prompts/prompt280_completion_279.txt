  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the context of the `mapper` function, which could cause it to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `mapper` function immediately, rather than returning a new function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper.apply(this, [])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `mapper` function immediately with an empty array as its argument, rather than returning a new function.

DONE.
