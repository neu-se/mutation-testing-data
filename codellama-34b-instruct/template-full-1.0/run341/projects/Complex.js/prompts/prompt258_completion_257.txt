  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0 && b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `b` is equal to 0 and then checks if `a` is greater than 0. In contrast, this new code checks if `a` is greater than 0 and then checks if `b` is equal to 0. This change would cause the function to return a different value if `a` is greater than 0 and `b` is not equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a >= 0 && b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `b` is equal to 0 and then checks if `a` is greater than 0. In contrast, this new code checks if `a` is greater than or equal to 0 and then checks if `b` is equal to 0. This change would cause the function to return a different value if `a` is greater than or equal to 0 and `b` is not
