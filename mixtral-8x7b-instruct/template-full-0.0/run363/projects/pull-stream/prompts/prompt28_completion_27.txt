 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[i]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the last argument instead of the first one, potentially causing unexpected behavior in the `pull` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first element from the `ref` array, causing the `pull` function to receive one less argument than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last element from the `ref` array, causing the `pull` function to receive one less argument than expected.

By introducing these changes, we can test the effectiveness of the test suite in catching unexpected behavior caused by changes in the code. DONE.
