  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.ok() && ses.makeQ
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only execute the `makeQ` function if the `ses.ok()` function returns `true`, whereas the original code would execute `makeQ` regardless of the result of `ses.ok()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.ok() || ses.makeQ
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only execute the `makeQ` function if the `ses.ok()` function returns `false`, whereas the original code would execute `makeQ` regardless of the result of `ses.ok()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.ok() ? ses.makeQ : noop
```
This would result in different behavior because it would execute the `makeQ` function if `ses.ok()` returns `true`, and the `noop` function if `ses.ok()` returns `false`, whereas the
