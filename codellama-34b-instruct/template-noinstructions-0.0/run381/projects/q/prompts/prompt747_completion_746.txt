  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(onFulfilled, onRejected, onProgress)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the `promise` object, which is not defined in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(onFulfilled, onRejected)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onProgress` callback is not included in the `then` method call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(onFulfilled)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onRejected` and `onProgress` callbacks are not included in the `then` method call.

DONE.
