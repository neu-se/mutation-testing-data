  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.url` is a string value, while `pathname` is a method that extracts the file name of a URL. Using `options.url` directly would result in the wrong file name being extracted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodeURIComponent(options.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.url` is a string value, while `decodeURIComponent()` is a function that decodes a URI-encoded string. Using `decodeURIComponent(options.url)` would result in the wrong file name being extracted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(options.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.url` is a string value, while `path.dirname()` is a method that extracts the file name of a path. Using `path.dirname(options.url)` would result in the wrong file name being extracted.
