  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index !== this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether the index is equal to the length of the `ops` array, while this modified code fragment checks whether the index is not equal to the length of the `ops` array. This would cause the `push` method to behave differently when the `ops` array is empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether the index is equal to the length of the `ops` array, while this modified code fragment checks whether the index is less than the length of the `ops` array. This would cause the `push` method to behave differently when the `ops` array is not empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether the index is equal to the length of the `
