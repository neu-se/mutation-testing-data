  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns an array of all the segments in the path, while the modified code fragment returns an array of all the segments in the path except the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns an array of all the segments in the path, while the modified code fragment returns an array of all the segments in the path except the last one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns an array of all the segments in the path, while the modified code fragment returns an array of all the segments in the path except the first and last ones.

DONE.
