  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, 'abort', onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `abort` value as the first argument to `abortCb`, but the new code fragment uses the string `'abort'` instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, null, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `abort` value as the first argument to `abortCb`, but the new code fragment uses `null` instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, onAbort, abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `abort` value as the second argument to `abortCb`, but the new code fragment uses `onAbort` instead.

DONE.
