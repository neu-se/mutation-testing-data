  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data.keys()` returns an iterator over the keys in the map, whereas `const [key, val] of this._data` destructures the map into an array of key-value pairs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(this._data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys()` returns an array of strings representing the keys in the object, whereas `const [key, val] of this._data` destructures the object into an array of key-value pairs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.entries()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data.entries()` returns an iterator over the key-value pairs in the map, whereas `const [key, val] of this._data` destructures the map into an array of key-value pairs.

DONE.
