  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `cb` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `acc` is null. If `acc` is null, the code would enter the `if` block and assign `acc` to `cb`, which would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb != acc
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `cb` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `cb` is not equal to `acc`. If `cb` is not equal to `acc`, the code would enter the `if` block and assign `acc` to `cb`, which would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof cb === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `cb` is falsy, while
