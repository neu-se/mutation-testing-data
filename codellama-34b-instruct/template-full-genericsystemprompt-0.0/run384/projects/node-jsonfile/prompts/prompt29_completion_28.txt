Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stringify(obj, options) + 'bug'
```
This would result in different behavior because the string 'bug' would be appended to the JSON string, causing the file to be corrupted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stringify(obj, options) + 'bug'
```
This would result in different behavior because the string 'bug' would be appended to the JSON string, causing the file to be corrupted.
