 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
''.concat(w.substr(0, w.length - 2))
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `concat` method instead of the `substr` method to concatenate the substring with the 'es' string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
w.slice(0, -2) + 'es'
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `slice` method instead of the `substr` method to extract the substring.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
w.substring(0, w.length - 2) + 'es'
