  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const { regex, props } = compile(spec)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compile` function is not being called with the correct arguments. The `spec` argument is not being passed to the `compile` function, which would cause the function to return an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const { regex, props } = compile(spec, version)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `version` argument is not being passed to the `compile` function, which would cause the function to return an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const { regex, props } = compile(spec, '1.1')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `version` argument is being hardcoded to `'1.1'`, which would cause the function to return an incorrect result if the `version` argument is not actually `'1.1'`.

DONE.
