  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isZero']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `this` is zero or `z` is infinite, while the new code fragment checks if `this` is not zero and `z` is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `this` is zero or `z` is infinite, while the new code fragment checks if `this` is zero and `z` is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

DONE.
