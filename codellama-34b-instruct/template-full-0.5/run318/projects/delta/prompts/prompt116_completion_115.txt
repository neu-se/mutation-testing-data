  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(accum, curr, index), initialValue
```
This would result in different behavior because the `predicate` function is not being passed the `index` parameter, which could cause it to behave differently when the `index` is important for the function's behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(accum, curr), initialValue
```
This would result in different behavior because the `predicate` function is not being passed the `index` parameter, which could cause it to behave differently when the `index` is important for the function's behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(accum, curr, index + 1), initialValue
```
This would result in different behavior because the `predicate` function is being passed an incorrect `index` parameter, which could cause it to behave differently when the `index` is important for the function's behavior.

DONE.
