  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable would be evaluated before the `test(data)` function is called, which could cause the loop to exit prematurely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end && !test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!end` and `!test(data)` expressions would be evaluated in the opposite order, which could cause the loop to continue even though the `test(data)` function returned `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data) !== end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test(data)` and `end` values would be compared using the `!==` operator, which would always return `true` if the `test(data)` function returned a truthy value, regardless of the value of `end`.

DONE.
