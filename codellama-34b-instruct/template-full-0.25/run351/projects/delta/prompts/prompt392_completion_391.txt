  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property is always non-zero, while `0` is a constant that can be used as a placeholder.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a valid value for the `length` property, while `0` is not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value for the `length` property, while `0` is not.

DONE.
