  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the while loop to continue even if `thisIter` has no more elements, which could lead to an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the while loop to continue even if `thisIter` has no more elements, and it would also cause the loop to continue if the next operation is a delete, which could lead to an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the while loop to continue even if `thisIter` has no more elements, and it would also cause the loop to continue if the next operation has a length greater than 0, which could lead to an infinite loop.

DONE.
