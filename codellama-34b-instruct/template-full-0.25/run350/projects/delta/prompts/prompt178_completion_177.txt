  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain - firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherOp.retain` property to be subtracted from `firstLeft`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstLeft - otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause `firstLeft` to be subtracted from `otherOp.retain`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain + firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause `otherOp.retain` and `firstLeft` to be added together, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
