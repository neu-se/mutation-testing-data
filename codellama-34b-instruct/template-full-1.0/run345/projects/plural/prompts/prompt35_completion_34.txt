  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 3
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.length - 3` would return the length of the word minus 3, while `w.length - 2` would return the length of the word minus 2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.length + 1` would return the length of the word plus 1, while `w.length - 2` would return the length of the word minus 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
foo.length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `foo` is an undefined variable, so `foo.length` would throw an error.

DONE.
