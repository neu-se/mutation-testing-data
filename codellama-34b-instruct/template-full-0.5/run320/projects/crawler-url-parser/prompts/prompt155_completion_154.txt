  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"/"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the base URL of the link to an absolute path, which could cause issues with relative links.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"../"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the base URL of the link to a relative path, which could cause issues with absolute links.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"#"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the base URL of the link to a fragment identifier, which could cause issues with links that are not intended to be fragments.

DONE.
