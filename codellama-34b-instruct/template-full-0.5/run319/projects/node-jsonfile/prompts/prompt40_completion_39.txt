  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromCallback` expects a callback function as its second argument, whereas `universalify.fromPromise` expects a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromStream
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromStream` expects a stream as its second argument, whereas `universalify.fromPromise` expects a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromSync` expects a synchronous function as its second argument, whereas `universalify.fromPromise` expects a promise.

DONE.
