  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `archiverOptions` would be `undefined`, which would cause the `archiver` function to use its default options, which might not be what the code intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{store: false}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `store` property would be set to `false`, which would cause the `archiver` function to compress the data, rather than storing it without compression, which might not be what the code intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{insertSpaces: true}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insertSpaces` property would be set to `true`, which would cause the `archiver` function to insert spaces between the archived files, which might not be what the code intended.

DONE.
