  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("PLACEHOLDER");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a new error object, rather than forwarding the rejection from the previous promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(new Error("PLACEHOLDER"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a new error object, rather than forwarding the rejection from the previous promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.resolve(new Error("PLACEHOLDER"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with a new error object, rather than forwarding the rejection from the previous promise.

DONE.
