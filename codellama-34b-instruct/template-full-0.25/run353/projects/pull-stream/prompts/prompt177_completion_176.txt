  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would always return `true`, even if `abort` is `false`. This would cause the `abortCb` function to be called unnecessarily, which could lead to performance issues or other unintended consequences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would always return `false`, even if `abort` is `true`. This would cause the `abortCb` function to never be called, which could lead to incorrect behavior or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the value of `abort`, causing the `abortCb` function to be called when it should not be. This could lead to incorrect behavior or errors.

DONE.
