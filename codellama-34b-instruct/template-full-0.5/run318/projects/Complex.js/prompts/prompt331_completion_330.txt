  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for `a` being equal to 0, while this new code fragment checks for `a` being not equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for `a` being equal to 0, while this new code fragment checks for `b` being equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(a) < 1e-6
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for `a` being equal to 0, while this new code fragment checks for `a` being within a small tolerance of 0.

DONE.
