 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
setTimeout
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets a new timeout instead of clearing the existing one, causing the promise to never resolve.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
clearInterval
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to clear an interval timer instead of a timeout, providing no effect on the timeout.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it unconditionally rejects the deferred promise, bypassing the original timeout logic.

DONE.
