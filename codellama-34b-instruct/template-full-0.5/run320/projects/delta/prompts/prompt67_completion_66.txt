  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method is called twice, which would result in the `newOp` being added to the `ops` array twice.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method is called on the `ops` array directly, rather than on the `this` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(index, 0, newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method is used to insert the `newOp` at a specific index in the `ops` array, rather than appending it to the end of the array.

DONE.
