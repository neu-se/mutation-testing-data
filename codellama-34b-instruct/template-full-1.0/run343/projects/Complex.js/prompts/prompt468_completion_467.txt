  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the positive imaginary part, but the original code returns the negative imaginary part if the absolute value is greater than EPSILON.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(b) >= Complex.EPSILON
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the absolute imaginary part, but the original code returns the negative imaginary part if the absolute value is greater than EPSILON.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return true if b is a finite number, but the original code returns the negative imaginary part if the absolute value is greater than EPSILON.

DONE.
