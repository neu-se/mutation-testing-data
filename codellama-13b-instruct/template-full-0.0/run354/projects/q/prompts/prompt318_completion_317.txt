  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be referring to the `Promise.prototype` object instead of the `promise` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be referring to the `Q.prototype` object instead of the `promise` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_create(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be creating a new object with a `null` prototype instead of using the `promise` object.

DONE.
