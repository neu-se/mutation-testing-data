  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
位1
```
This would result in different behavior because the longitude of the destination point would be calculated using the longitude of the origin point, instead of the longitude of the destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
位2 + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the longitude of the destination point would be calculated using the longitude of the origin point, plus 180 degrees.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
位1 + 位2
```
This would result in different behavior because the longitude of the destination point would be calculated using the sum of the longitudes of the origin and destination points.

DONE.
