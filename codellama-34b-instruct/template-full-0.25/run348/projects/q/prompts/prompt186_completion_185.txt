  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/at ([\w]+):(\d+):(?:\d+)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because the original regular expression only matches strings that start with a space, while the new regular expression matches any word character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/at ([^ ]+):(\d+):(?:\d+)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because the original regular expression only matches strings that start with a space, while the new regular expression matches any character that is not a space.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/at ([^ ]+):(\d+):(?:\d+)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because the original regular expression only matches strings that start with a space, while the new regular expression matches any character that is not a space.

DONE.
