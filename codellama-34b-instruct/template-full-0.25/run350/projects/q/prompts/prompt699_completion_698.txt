  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument passed to the `array_slice` function would be different, which could potentially change the resulting array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` variable is not defined in the function, so it would cause a reference error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[], 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty array `[]` would be passed as the first argument to `array_slice`, which would cause the function to return a different result.

DONE.
