  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the string into an array of substrings using commas as the separator, while the new code fragment splits the string into an array of substrings using spaces as the separator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the string into an array of substrings using commas as the separator, while the new code fragment does not split the string into an array of substrings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'hello'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the string into an array of substrings using commas as the separator, while the new code fragment splits the string into an array of substrings using the string 'hello' as the separator.

DONE.
