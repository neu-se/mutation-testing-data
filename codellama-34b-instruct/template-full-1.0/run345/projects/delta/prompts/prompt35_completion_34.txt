  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof b !== 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the value of `b` is not `undefined`, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof b !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the value of `b` is not a string, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof b !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the value of `b` is not a number, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
