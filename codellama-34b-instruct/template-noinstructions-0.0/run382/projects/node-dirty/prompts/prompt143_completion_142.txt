  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error('Something went wrong')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a new error with a different message, which could cause the test suite to fail if it is not expecting this specific error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a null error, which could cause the test suite to fail if it is expecting a non-null error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', err.message
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit the error message instead of the error object, which could cause the test suite to fail if it is expecting the error object.

DONE.
