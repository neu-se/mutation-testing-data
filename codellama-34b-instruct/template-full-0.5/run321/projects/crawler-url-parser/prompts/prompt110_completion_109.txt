  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because `clear()` removes all elements from the `Map`, whereas `delete` only removes a specific element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set("baseUrl", null);
```
This would result in different behavior because `set()` sets the value of a specific key in the `Map`, whereas `delete` removes an element from the `Map`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.size = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because `size` is a property of the `Map` class that returns the number of elements in the `Map`, whereas `delete` removes an element from the `Map`.

DONE.
