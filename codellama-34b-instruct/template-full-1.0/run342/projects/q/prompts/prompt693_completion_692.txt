  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args
```
This would result in different behavior because `args` is not defined in the function scope, and would therefore cause a `ReferenceError` to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only use the first argument, rather than all of the arguments, to calculate the `array_slice`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.args
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise` is not defined in the function scope, and would therefore cause a `ReferenceError` to be thrown.

DONE.
