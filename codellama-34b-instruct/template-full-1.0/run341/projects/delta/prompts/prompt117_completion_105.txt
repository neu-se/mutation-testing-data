  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property is not a function and would not be invoked, but instead would be referred to as a property of the `elem` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.insert.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` property is a string, and `length` would refer to the string's length, not the `insert` function's length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!elem.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` property would be negated, which would always be truthy if it is a function and always falsey if it is not.

DONE.
