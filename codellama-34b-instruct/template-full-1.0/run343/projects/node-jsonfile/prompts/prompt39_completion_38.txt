  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `writeFileSync` is a synchronous function that returns a value, while `writeFile` is an asynchronous function that does not return a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.writeFileSync(file, str.toString(), options)
```
This would result in different behavior because `str.toString()` would convert the `str` variable to a string, which may not be the same as the original encoding.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.writeFileSync(file, str.replace(/\uFFFE|\\u0000/g, ''), options)
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/\uFFFE|\\u0000/g` would remove null characters from the `str` variable, which may not be desired in all cases.

DONE.
