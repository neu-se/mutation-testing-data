  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance + 1
```
This change will cause the `calculateDestination` method to return a different result than the original code, which could potentially reveal a bug in the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance * 2
```
This change will also cause the `calculateDestination` method to return a different result than the original code, which could potentially reveal a bug in the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance / 2
```
This change will cause the `calculateDestination` method to return a different result than the original code, which could potentially reveal a bug in the test suite.

DONE.
