  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.latitude === undefined || object.longitude === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `latitude` and `longitude` properties are `undefined`, rather than checking if they are missing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.latitude !== 'number' || object.longitude !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `latitude` and `longitude` properties are not numbers, rather than checking if they are missing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.latitude === null || object.longitude === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `latitude` and `longitude` properties are `null`, rather than checking if they are missing.

DONE.
