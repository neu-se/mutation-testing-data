  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onRejected.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `onRejected.bind(null)` is a function that returns a new function with the `this` value bound to `null`, whereas `onRejected` is a function that is called with the `this` value set to the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because `onRejected.call(null)` is a function that calls `onRejected` with the `this` value set to `null`, whereas `onRejected` is a function that is called with the `this` value set to the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onRejected.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `onRejected.apply(null)` is a function that calls `onRejected` with the `this
