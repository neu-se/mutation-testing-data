Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).catch(void 0, progressed);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the promise handling to only catch rejections and ignore progress notifications, which is not the intended functionality of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(progressed, void 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it reverses the order of the parameters, causing the `progressed` callback to be invoked on fulfillment instead of on progress notifications, which alters the intended use of the progress feature.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(void 0, progressed, void 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an unnecessary third argument (which is `void 0`), leading to potential confusion and incorrect handling of the promise's progress notifications, as the original code expects a specific structure for the `then` method.

DONE.
