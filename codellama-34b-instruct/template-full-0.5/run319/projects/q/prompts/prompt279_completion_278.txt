  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code would skip the first argument and start slicing from the second argument, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code would only slice the first two arguments, which could lead to missing data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code would only slice the first argument, which could lead to incorrect results.

DONE.
