  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < end && iter.hasNext() && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `&& false` would cause the loop to terminate immediately, regardless of the values of `index` and `end`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < end && iter.hasNext() && index > end
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `&& index > end` would cause the loop to terminate immediately if `index` is greater than `end`, regardless of the value of `iter.hasNext()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < end && iter.hasNext() && index == end
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `&& index == end` would cause the loop to terminate immediately if `index` is equal to `end`, regardless of the value of `iter.hasNext()`.

DONE.
