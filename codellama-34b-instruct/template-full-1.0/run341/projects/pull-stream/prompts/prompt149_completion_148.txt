  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.keys()` returns an array of keys in the object, while `Object.keys(object)` returns an array of strings representing the property names of the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object[Symbol.iterator]()
```
This would result in different behavior because `object[Symbol.iterator]()` returns an iterator over the values of the object, while `Object.keys(object)` returns an array of strings representing the property names of the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.values()` returns an iterable of the values in the object, while `Object.keys(object)` returns an array of strings representing the property names of the object.

DONE.
