  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because the delete property would be checked instead of the insert property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.attributes.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because the delete property would be checked in the attributes object instead of the elem object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!elem.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the insert property would be negated, meaning that the code would only execute if the insert property is falsy.

DONE.
