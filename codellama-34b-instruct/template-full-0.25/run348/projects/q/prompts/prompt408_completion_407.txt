  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` checks if an object is a promise-like object, which means it has a `then` method, but it may not be a true promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFulfilled` checks if a promise is in the fulfilled state, but it does not check if the promise is pending or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `isRejected` checks if a promise is in the rejected state, but it does not check if the promise is pending or fulfilled.

DONE.
