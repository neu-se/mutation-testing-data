  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(point1.longitude) - deg2rad(point2.longitude)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code, but it uses the `deg2rad` function on both `point1.longitude` and `point2.longitude` instead of just `point1.longitude`. This could potentially cause the calculation to produce different results if the `deg2rad` function has different behavior for different input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(point1.longitude) - rad2deg(point2.longitude)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code, but it uses the `rad2deg` function on both `point1.longitude` and `point2.longitude` instead of just `point1.longitude`. This could potentially cause the calculation to produce different results if the `rad2deg` function has different behavior for different input values.
