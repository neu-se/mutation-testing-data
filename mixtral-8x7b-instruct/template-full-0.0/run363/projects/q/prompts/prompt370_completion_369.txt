 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
_progressed.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `_progressed` would be called with `null` as its `this` value, which might cause issues if `_progressed` relies on `this` referring to the correct object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return _progressed + 1; }
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of passing the progress value to the callback, it would return the value of `_progressed` plus 1, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function (value) { deferred.resolve(value); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately resolve the promise, bypassing the actual progress notifications.

DONE.
