  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort
```
This would result in different behavior because "abort" is a different variable than "cb" and it is not clear why it is being passed to the callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because "null" is a different value than "cb" and it is not clear why it is being passed to the callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because "undefined" is a different value than "cb" and it is not clear why it is being passed to the callback.

DONE.
