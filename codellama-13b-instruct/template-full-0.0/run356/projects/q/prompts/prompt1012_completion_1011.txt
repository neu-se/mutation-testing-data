  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nextTick(function () {
    nodeback(null, value);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Q.nextTick` to schedule the callback to be executed asynchronously, while the modified code executes the callback immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nextTick(function () {
    nodeback(error);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Q.nextTick` to schedule the callback to be executed asynchronously, while the modified code executes the callback immediately.

DONE.
