  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { throw new Error("test error"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to reject with the given error message, whereas the original code would have called the fallback function with the given arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { return 42; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to resolve with the given value, whereas the original code would have called the fallback function with the given arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { return Promise.reject(new Error("test error")); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to reject with the given error message, whereas the original code would have called the fallback function with the given arguments.

DONE.
