  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 to the index would cause the code to consider the next line in the delta, rather than the current line. This could potentially cause the iteration to skip a line or consider extra lines.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 1 from the index would cause the code to consider the previous line in the delta, rather than the current line. This could potentially cause the iteration to miss a line or consider lines out of order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 2 to the index would cause the code to consider the line after the next line in the delta, rather than the current line. This could potentially cause the iteration to skip a line or consider lines out of order.

DONE.
