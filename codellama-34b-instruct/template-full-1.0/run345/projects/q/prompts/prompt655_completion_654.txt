  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not an object, and the `dispatch()` method is expecting an object as its first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an object, and the `dispatch()` method is expecting an object as its first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because `true` is not an object, and the `dispatch()` method is expecting an object as its first argument.

DONE.
