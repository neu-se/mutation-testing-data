  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index++]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the index variable before accessing the array element, potentially leading to a different element being accessed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the element at the next index instead of the current one, potentially leading to a different element being accessed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the element at the previous index instead of the current one, potentially leading to a different element being accessed.

DONE.
