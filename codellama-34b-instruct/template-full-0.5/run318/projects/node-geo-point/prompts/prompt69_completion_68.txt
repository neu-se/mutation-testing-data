  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x, y
```
This would result in different behavior because the x and y values would be swapped, leading to an incorrect calculation of the bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y, x * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the x value would be multiplied by 2, leading to an incorrect calculation of the bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x, y + 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the y value would be increased by 10, leading to an incorrect calculation of the bearing.

DONE.
