  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function is called instead of `resolve`, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function is called with a `null` value instead of the expected `filename` object, which would cause the promise to be resolved with a different value than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve({ filename: 'different_dest' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function is called with a different `filename` value than expected, which would cause the promise to be resolved with a different value than expected.

DONE.
