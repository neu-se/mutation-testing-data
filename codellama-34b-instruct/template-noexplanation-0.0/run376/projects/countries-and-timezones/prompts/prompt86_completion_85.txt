  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c.id, options
```
This change will cause the `getCountry` function to return a different country than the one that was originally intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c.name, options
```
This change will cause the `getCountry` function to return a different country than the one that was originally intended, based on the country's name instead of its ID.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c.timezones[0], options
```
This change will cause the `getCountry` function to return a different country than the one that was originally intended, based on the country's first timezone instead of its ID.

DONE.
