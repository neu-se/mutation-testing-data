Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `deliverCountry` would receive `undefined` instead of the `options` object, potentially leading to errors or unexpected behavior when trying to access properties like `deprecated`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because passing an empty object would mean that the `deprecated` property is not defined, causing the `deliverCountry` function to always return the `country.timezones` instead of potentially filtering based on the `deprecated` flag.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ deprecated: false }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the `deliverCountry` function to always treat the country as not deprecated, which could lead to incorrect data being returned if the country is actually marked as deprecated in the original data.

DONE.
