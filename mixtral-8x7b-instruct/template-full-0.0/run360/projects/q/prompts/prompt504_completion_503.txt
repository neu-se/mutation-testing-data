 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
value.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly calls the `apply` method on the `value` object, bypassing any potential custom behavior defined in the `Promise` prototype.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Function.prototype.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `apply` method from the `Function` prototype, which may not have the desired effect when used with arbitrary objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to call the `apply` method with `null` as the `this` value, which may cause errors or unexpected behavior depending on the context.

DONE.
