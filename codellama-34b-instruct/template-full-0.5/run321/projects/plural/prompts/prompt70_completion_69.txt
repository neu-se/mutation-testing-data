  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('cello', 'cellos')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `addRule` function to add a new rule to the `rules` array, but this code fragment calls the `addRule` function with the same arguments, which would not change the behavior of the program.

```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the rule `['cello', 'cellos']` to the `rules` array, but this code fragment adds the rule `['cel
