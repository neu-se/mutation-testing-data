 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned value from the `asyncMap` function would change, potentially causing tests to fail that are checking for specific return values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the mutation would modify the original data, potentially causing tests to fail that are checking for specific data values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the mutation would apply the `map` function to the `data` again, potentially causing tests to fail that are checking for specific data values or the number of times `map` is called.

DONE.
