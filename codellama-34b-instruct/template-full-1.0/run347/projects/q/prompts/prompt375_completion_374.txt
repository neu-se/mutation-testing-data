  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
threw
```
This would result in different behavior because the `threw` variable is undefined, and undefined variables are truthy in JavaScript. Therefore, the `if` statement would always be entered, even if no exception was thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof threw === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `threw` variable is a function, which would never be the case. Therefore, the `if` statement would never be entered, even if an exception was thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
threw !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `threw` variable is not exactly `true`, which would always be the case if it is a boolean value. Therefore, the `if` statement would always be entered, even if no exception was thrown.

DONE.
