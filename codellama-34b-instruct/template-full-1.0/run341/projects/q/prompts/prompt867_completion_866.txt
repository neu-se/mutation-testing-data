  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `deferred.notify`, which would notify the promise of progress updates, rather than `deferred.resolve`, which would resolve the promise with a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error(" promises can not be fulfilled with multiple values "))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `deferred.resolve(value)`, which would resolve the promise with a single value, rather than `deferred.reject`, which would reject the promise with an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `deferred.resolve(value)`, which would resolve the promise with a value, rather than `null`, which would resolve the promise with no value.

DONE.
