  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `messages.length` would always be truthy, even if the promise has been resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `messages[0]` would be `undefined` if the promise has been resolved, and `undefined` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `messages.length > 0` would be `false` if the promise has been resolved, and `false` is falsy.

DONE.
