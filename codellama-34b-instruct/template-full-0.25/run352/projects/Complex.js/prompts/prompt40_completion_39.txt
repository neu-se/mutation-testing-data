  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b + b * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication order is changed, which could result in a different value being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a - b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction operator is used instead of addition, which could result in a different value being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b - b * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction operator is used instead of addition, which could result in a different value being returned.

DONE.
