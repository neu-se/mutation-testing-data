Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'moose', 'mooses'
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly pluralizes "moose" as "mooses" instead of the correct plural form, which is "moose".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mouse', 'mouses'
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly pluralizes "mouse" as "mouses" instead of the correct plural form, which is "mice".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose', 'gooses'
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly pluralizes "goose" as "gooses" instead of the correct plural form, which is "geese".

DONE.
