 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` uses a regular expression and may return a different index or -1 if no match is found.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.match
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` returns an array of matches or null if no match is found, instead of the index of the match.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.lastIndexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastIndexOf` searches from the end of the string instead of the beginning, and may return a different index.

DONE.
