Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` computes the square root of a number, which can lead to incorrect results when calculating the hypotenuse, as it does not account for negative values like `Math.abs` does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` rounds down to the nearest integer, which could lead to inaccurate calculations in the hypotenuse function, especially when dealing with non-integer values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * x
```
This would result in different behavior because using `x * x` directly would eliminate the absolute value check, potentially resulting in negative values being squared, which could lead to incorrect hypotenuse calculations.

DONE.
