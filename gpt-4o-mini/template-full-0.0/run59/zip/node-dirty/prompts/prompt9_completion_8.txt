Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, null
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of storing the value associated with the key, it would store `null`, effectively removing the key from the data map without triggering the intended behavior of storing the actual value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val, key
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly set the key to the value and the value to the key, leading to a situation where the data map would not store the intended key-value pairs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, val + ' modified'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append the string ' modified' to the value being stored, altering the original value and potentially leading to unexpected results when retrieving the data later.

DONE.
