  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x, y
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the coordinates is reversed, which could cause issues when using the resulting `GeoPoint` object in other calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y, x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `x` coordinate is being incremented by 1, which could cause the resulting `GeoPoint` object to be in a different location than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1, y
```
This would result in different behavior because the `x` coordinate is being incremented by 1, which could cause the resulting `GeoPoint` object to be in a different location than expected.

DONE.
