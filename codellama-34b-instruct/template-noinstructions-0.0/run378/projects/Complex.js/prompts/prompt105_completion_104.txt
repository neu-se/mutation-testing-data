  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['NAN'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns a complex number with a real part of 0 and an imaginary part of 0, while this code returns a complex number with a real part of NaN and an imaginary part of NaN.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['INFINITY'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns a complex number with a real part of 0 and an imaginary part of 0, while this code returns a complex number with a real part of Infinity and an imaginary part of Infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['NAN'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns a complex number with a real part of 0 and an imaginary part of 0, while this code returns a complex number with a real part of NaN and an imaginary part of NaN.

DONE.
