  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.progress
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push a `progress` message instead of a `progressListener` function to the `progressListeners` array, which could lead to errors in the promise's progress reporting.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.mean(progressListeners)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `progressListeners` array with its mean value, which could cause issues in the promise's progress reporting.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_length(progressListeners)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the length of the `progressListeners` array to the `progressListeners` array, which could cause errors in the promise's progress reporting.

DONE.
