  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
hours + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hours` variable would be incremented by 1, which would cause the offset string to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(hours / 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hours` variable would be divided by 2, which would cause the offset string to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
hours * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hours` variable would be multiplied by 2, which would cause the offset string to be incorrect.

DONE.
