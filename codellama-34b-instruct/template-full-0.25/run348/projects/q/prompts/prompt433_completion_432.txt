  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

trackUnhandledRejections === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trackUnhandledRejections` variable is initialized to `true` and the `!` operator would negate its value, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` and the `trackRejection` function to not be called.
