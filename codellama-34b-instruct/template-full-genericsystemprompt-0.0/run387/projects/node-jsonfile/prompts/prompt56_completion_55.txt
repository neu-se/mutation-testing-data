  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replace(/^\n/g, EOL)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only replace the first occurrence of `\n` in the string, whereas the original code replaces all occurrences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replace(/\r\n/g, EOL)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only replace the occurrences of `\r\n` in the string, whereas the original code replaces all occurrences of `\n`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replace(/[\n\r]/g, EOL)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only replace the occurrences of `\n` or `\r` in the string, whereas the original code replaces all occurrences of `\n`.

DONE.
