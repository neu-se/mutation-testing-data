  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the function would forward the given arguments as an array to the Node function. However, if we replace the PLACEHOLDER with null, the function would forward a null value instead, which would likely cause the Node function to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the function would forward the given arguments as an array to the Node function. However, if we replace the PLACEHOLDER with undefined, the function would forward an undefined value instead, which would likely cause the Node function to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the function would forward the given arguments as an array to the Node function. However, if we replace the PLACEHOLDER with an empty array, the function would forward an empty array instead
