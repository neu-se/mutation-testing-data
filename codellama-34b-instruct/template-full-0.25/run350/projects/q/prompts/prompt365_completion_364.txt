  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!done
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the boolean value of `done`, so the `rejected` callback would be called even if the promise was fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator short-circuits the evaluation of the expression if the first operand is falsy, so the `rejected` callback would never be called even if the promise was rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator short-circuits the evaluation of the expression if the first operand is truthy, so the `rejected` callback would be called even if the promise was fulfilled.

DONE.
