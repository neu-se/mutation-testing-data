  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` changes the contents of the array, while `slice` returns a new array that is a copy of the original.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const ops = this.ops;
ops.splice(this.index, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` changes the contents of the array, while `ops.slice()` returns a new array that is a copy of the original.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[this.ops[this.index], ...this.ops.slice(this.index + 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array that includes the element at the current index, as well as all elements after the current index, whereas `ops.slice()` returns a new array that is a copy of the original.

DONE.
