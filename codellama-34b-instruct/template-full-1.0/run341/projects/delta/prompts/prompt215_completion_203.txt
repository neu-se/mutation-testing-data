  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops + other.ops;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `concat` method, which modifies and returns the original array, while this replacement code fragment is using the `+` operator, which returns a new array containing the elements of both operands.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops.slice(other.ops.length);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is removing the first `other.ops.length` elements from the `delta.ops` array, while this replacement code fragment is slicing the `delta.ops` array from the `other.ops.length`th element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops.length -= other.ops.length;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is resetting the `length` property of the `delta.ops` array to `other.ops.length`, while
