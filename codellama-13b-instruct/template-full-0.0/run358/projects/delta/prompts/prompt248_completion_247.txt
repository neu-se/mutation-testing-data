  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the parentheses are required to call the `peekLength()` method, and without them, the code would not compile.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` property is a number, and without the parentheses, it would be treated as a number rather than a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` property is a number, and adding 1 to it would result in a different value.

DONE.
