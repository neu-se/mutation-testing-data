  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
5
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `dispatch` would be called with the constant `5` instead of the variable `op`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `dispatch` would be called with the string `"foo"` instead of the variable `op`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
5 + 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `dispatch` would be called with the result of the expression `5 + 3` instead of the variable `op`.

DONE.
