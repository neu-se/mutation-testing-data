  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections[at]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `array_indexOf` function to search for the `promise` object in the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, which is not the same as searching for the `promise` object in the `unhandledRejections` array.

DONE.
