  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextStream` is a function that reads the next stream, whereas `nextChunk` is a function that reads the next chunk of data from the current stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read(null, function (err, data) {
  if (err) {
    if (err === true) nextStream()
    else read(true, function(abortErr) {
      // TODO: what do we do with the abortErr?
      cb(err)
    })
  }
  else cb(null, data)
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `_read` function with a null error and a function that reads the next chunk of data from the current stream, whereas the original code fragment calls the `_read` function with a null error and a function that reads the next stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(null
