  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.trim();
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the URL is formatted using `URL.format()`, which would include the protocol and hostname. However, if `baseUrlStr` is replaced with `baseUrlStr.trim()`, the protocol and hostname would be removed from the URL, resulting in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.slice(0, -3);
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the URL is formatted using `URL.format()`, which would include the protocol and hostname. However, if `baseUrlStr` is replaced with `baseUrlStr.slice(0, -3)`, the protocol and hostname would be removed from the URL, resulting in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + baseUrlStr.slice(1);
```
This would result in different behavior
