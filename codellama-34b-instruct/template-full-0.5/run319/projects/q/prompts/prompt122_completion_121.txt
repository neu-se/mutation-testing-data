  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value and does not have properties, so the `for...in` loop would not iterate over any properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value and does not have properties, so the `for...in` loop would not iterate over any properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty object `{}` does not have any properties, so the `for...in` loop would not iterate over any properties.

DONE.
