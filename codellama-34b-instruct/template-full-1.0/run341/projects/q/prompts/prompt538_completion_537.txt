  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.any
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.any` is a promise that resolves when any promise in the array is fulfilled, whereas `this.all` is a promise that resolves when all promises in the array are fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.none
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.none` is a promise that resolves when no promise in the array is fulfilled, whereas `this.all` is a promise that resolves when all promises in the array are fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.race
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.race` is a promise that resolves when the first promise in the array is fulfilled, whereas `this.all` is a promise that resolves when all promises in the array are fulfilled.

DONE.
