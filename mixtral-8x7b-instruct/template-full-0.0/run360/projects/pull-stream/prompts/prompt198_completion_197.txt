 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.exit(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the script would terminate immediately, not waiting for the async operation to complete or handle any errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the callback with a null error, indicating successful completion, even if the source has already ended with an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log('Skipping callback')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would log a message and not call the callback, leaving the async operation unresolved and potentially causing the application to hang or behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
