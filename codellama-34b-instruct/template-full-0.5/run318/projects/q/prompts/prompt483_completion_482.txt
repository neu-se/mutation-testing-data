  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `at` method would be called on the `unhandledReasons` array with an index of `1`, instead of `0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `at` method would be called on the `unhandledReasons` array with an index of `unhandledReasons.length - 1`, instead of `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `at` method would be called on the `unhandledReasons` array with an index of `unhandledReasons.length`, which would be out of bounds.

DONE.
