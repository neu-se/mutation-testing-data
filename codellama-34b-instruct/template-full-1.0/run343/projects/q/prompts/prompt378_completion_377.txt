  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then
```
This would result in different behavior because it would execute the callback function immediately instead of using it as a node in a promise chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected, potentially executing the rejection callback instead of the fulfillment callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).cast
```
This would result in different behavior because it would coerce the promise into a new Q promise, potentially changing the behavior of the promise chain.

DONE.
