  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method is being called with the wrong argument. The original code fragment was checking if `z` is zero, but the new code fragment is checking if `a` is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is being called without any arguments. The original code fragment was checking if `z` is infinite, but the new code fragment is checking if `z` is infinite and also returning `true` if `z` is not a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` method is being called without any arguments. The original code fragment was checking if `z` is not a number, but the new code fragment is checking if `z` is not a number and
