  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[value, value]
```
This would result in different behavior because the key and value are the same, whereas the original code fragment assigns a different value to the key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[value, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because the first element of the array is a value, whereas the original code fragment assigns a key. The second element is undefined, whereas the original code fragment assigns a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[0, 0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the first element of the array is 0, whereas the original code fragment assigns a key. The second element is also 0, whereas the original code fragment assigns a value.

DONE.
