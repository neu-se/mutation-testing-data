  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goos'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `'goose'`, which would return `'gooses'`, but the new code fragment is `'goos'`, which would return `'goos'`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `'goose'`, which would return `'gooses'`, but the new code fragment is `'goose'`, which would return `'goose'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'geese'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `'goose'`, which would return `'gooses'`, but the new code fragment is `'geese'`, which would return `'geese'`.

DONE.
