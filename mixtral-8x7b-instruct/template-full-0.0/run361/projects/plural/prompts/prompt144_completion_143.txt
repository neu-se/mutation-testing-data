 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
rule[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule[1]` refers to the second element of the rule array, which is the result function or the replacement string, instead of the first element that is the matching pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
rule['0']
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a string literal instead of a bareword for the property access, which would cause a runtime error since `rule` is an array and does not have a `'0'` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
rule.match(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `match` method to test if the word matches the rule pattern, instead of directly comparing the rule pattern with the word. This would cause a runtime error if the rule pattern is not a regular expression, since `match` is a method of the String prototype and not the RegExp prototype.
