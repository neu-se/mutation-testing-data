  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the new array will have a length of 1, whereas the original array will have a length of 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because the new array will have a length of 1 and will contain the value `undefined`, whereas the original array will have a length of 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[null]
```
This would result in different behavior because the new array will have a length of 1 and will contain the value `null`, whereas the original array will have a length of 0.

DONE.
