  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
longitude <= -180 || longitude >= 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for strict inequality, while this new code fragment checks for non-strict inequality. This means that if `longitude` is equal to -180 or 180, the original code would throw an error, while this new code would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
longitude < -180 || longitude > 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for strict inequality, while this new code fragment checks for non-strict inequality. This means that if `longitude` is equal to -180 or 180, the original code would throw an error, while this new code would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
longitude != -180 && longitude != 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code
