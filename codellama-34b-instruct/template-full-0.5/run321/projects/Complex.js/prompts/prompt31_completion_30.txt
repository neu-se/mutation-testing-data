  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Math.abs()` function to be applied to the `a` variable twice, which could potentially produce a different result if `a` is a negative number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `b` variable to be multiplied by 2 before being passed to the `Math.abs()` function, which could potentially produce a different result if `b` is a non-integer value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `a` and `b` variables to be added together before being passed to the `Math.abs()` function, which could potentially produce a different result if `a` and `b` have different signs.

DONE.
