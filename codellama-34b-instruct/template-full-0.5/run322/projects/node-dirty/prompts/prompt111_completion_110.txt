  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer.slice(0, -1)}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last character of the buffer, which would cause the error message to be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Corrupted row at the beginning of the db: ${buffer.slice(1)}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first character of the buffer, which would cause the error message to be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer.toUpperCase()}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the buffer to uppercase, which would cause the error message to be different.

DONE.
