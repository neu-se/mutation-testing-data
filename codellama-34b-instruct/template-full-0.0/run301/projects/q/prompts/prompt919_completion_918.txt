  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is not called, which would cause the `nodeArgs` array to be passed to the `Q` function without being modified.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` argument would be passed to the `makeNodeResolver` method, which would cause the `nodeArgs` array to be modified in a way that is different from the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(deferred.promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.promise` argument would be passed to the `makeNodeResolver` method, which would cause the `nodeArgs` array to be modified in a way that is different from the original code.

DONE.
