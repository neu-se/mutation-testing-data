  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `z` is infinite, but the new code fragment checks if `z` is infinite and also if `z` is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']() || z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `z` is infinite, but the new code fragment checks if `z` is infinite or if `z` is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']() && z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `z` is infinite, but the new code fragment checks if `z` is both infinite and zero.

DONE.
