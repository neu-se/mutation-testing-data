  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method takes the index at which to start removing elements as its second argument, not the number of elements to remove. Using `1` instead of `0` would remove the first element of the array instead of the last one.

DONE.
