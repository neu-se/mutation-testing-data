  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.prototype.plural === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `plural` property is undefined, while this replacement checks if it's null. If the `plural` property is null, the code will throw an error instead of adding the `plural` function to the `String` prototype.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.prototype.plural !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `plural` property is undefined, while this replacement checks if it's not undefined. If the `plural` property is not undefined, the code will add the `plural` function to the `String` prototype, even if it's already defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof String.prototype.plural === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `plural` property is undefined,
