  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop !== undefined || match[index + 1] === prop
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, while the `===` operator checks for strict equality. This change would cause the `matches` method to return `true` if the `prop` variable is not undefined or if the `match[index + 1]` variable is equal to the `prop` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop !== undefined && match[index + 1] !== prop
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, while the `&&` operator checks for logical AND. This change would cause the `matches` method to return `true` if the `prop` variable is not undefined and if the `match[index + 1]` variable is not equal to the `prop` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop === undefined || match[index + 1] ===
