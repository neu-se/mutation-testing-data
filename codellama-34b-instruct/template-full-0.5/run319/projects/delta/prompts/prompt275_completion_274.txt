  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, which would make the `else if` block and the `else` block unreachable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, which would make the `else if` block and the `else` block unreachable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, which would make the `else if` block and the `else` block unreachable.

DONE.
