  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result = generator.next(arg);
```
This would result in different behavior because `generator.next()` is a method that returns the next value in an iterator, while `generator[verb](arg)` is a method that yields a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result = generator.throw(arg);
```
This would result in different behavior because `generator.throw()` is a method that throws an exception, while `generator[verb](arg)` is a method that yields a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result = generator.return(arg);
```
This would result in different behavior because `generator.return()` is a method that returns a value from a generator function, while `generator[verb](arg)` is a method that yields a value.

DONE.
