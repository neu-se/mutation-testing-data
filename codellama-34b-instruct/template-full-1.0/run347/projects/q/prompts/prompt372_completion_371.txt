  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror.throw();
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.onerror.throw()` is a method that throws an error, whereas `Q.onerror` is a method that handles an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror.log();
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.onerror.log()` is a method that logs an error to the console, whereas `Q.onerror` is a method that handles an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.error();
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.error()` is a method that throws an error, whereas `Q.onerror` is a method that handles an error.

DONE.
