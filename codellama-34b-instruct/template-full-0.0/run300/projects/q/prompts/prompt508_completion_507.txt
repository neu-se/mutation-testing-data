  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a different method than `apply`, and it would change the way the function is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a specific `this` value and arguments, whereas `apply` and `call` simply call the function with a specific `this` value and arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.toString
```
This would result in different behavior because `toString` returns a string representation of the function, whereas `apply` and `call` call the function.

DONE.
