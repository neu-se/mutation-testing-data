  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(abort, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls the `abortCb` function with `abort` as an argument, but this replacement code calls the `cb` function with `abort` as the first argument and `null` as the second argument. This would change the behavior of the function and potentially cause tests that rely on this behavior to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls the `abortCb` function with `abort` as an argument, but this replacement code calls the `cb` function with `abort` as the first argument and `onAbort` as the second argument. This would change the behavior of the function and potentially cause tests that rely on this behavior to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(onAbort, abort)
```
This would result in
