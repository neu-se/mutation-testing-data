  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Q(makeGenerator)`
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.async` expects a function that returns a generator, but `Q(makeGenerator)` will return a promise that resolves to a generator, which will cause the decorator to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```return makeGenerator()`
```
This would result in different behavior because `makeGenerator` is a function that returns a generator, but `return makeGenerator()` will return the value returned by the generator, which may not be a function that the decorator can call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Q(makeGenerator()).value```
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(makeGenerator()).value` will return the resolved value of the promise returned by `makeGenerator`, which may not be a function that the decorator can call.

DONE.
