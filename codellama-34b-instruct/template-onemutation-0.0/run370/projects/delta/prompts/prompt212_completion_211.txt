  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the length of the `other.ops` array is greater than 0, while the mutated code fragment checks if the length is less than 0. This would cause the `concat` method to behave differently when the `other` delta has no operations.

DONE.
