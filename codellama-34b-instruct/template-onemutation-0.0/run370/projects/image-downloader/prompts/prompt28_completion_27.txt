  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimRight().startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `trimRight()` removes characters from the end of the string, whereas `trimLeft()` removes characters from the beginning of the string. This means that the resulting string may be different, and the `startsWith` method may return a different result.

DONE.
