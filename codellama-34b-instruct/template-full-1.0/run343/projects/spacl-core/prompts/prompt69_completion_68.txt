  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.check
```
This would result in different behavior because `check` is a different public method in the `Rule` class, even though it also accepts the same arguments as `query`. This could cause the policy to match different rules or allow actions that it should not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.evaluate
```
This would result in different behavior because `evaluate` is a different private method in the `Policy` class that is not accessible from other parts of the codebase. This could cause errors or unexpected behavior when the policy is used.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!rule.query
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT operator that returns the opposite of what `query` would return. This could cause the policy to allow actions that it should not or deny actions that it should allow.

DONE.
