  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if `a` is not equal to 0, while this replacement checks if `a` is equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if `a` is not equal to 0, while this replacement checks if `a` is equal to infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if `a` is not equal to 0, while this replacement checks if `a` is not equal to NaN.

DONE.
