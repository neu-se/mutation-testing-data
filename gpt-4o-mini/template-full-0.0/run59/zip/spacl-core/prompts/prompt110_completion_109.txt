Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = 'GET'
```
This would result in different behavior because it hardcodes the verb to 'GET', meaning that only this specific verb will be allowed, regardless of what verbs are passed to the `allow` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = verbs[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly assigns the first verb from the `verbs` array to `verb`, which may lead to ignoring the rest of the verbs passed to the method, thus not allowing them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = 'DENY'
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the verb to a string 'DENY', which is not a valid action in the context of the `allow` method, potentially causing all verbs to be denied regardless of the input.

DONE.
