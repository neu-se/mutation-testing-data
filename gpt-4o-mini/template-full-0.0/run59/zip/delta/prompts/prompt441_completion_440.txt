Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.insert.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` does not modify the string in the same way as `substr`, potentially leading to incorrect substring extraction.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.insert.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because converting the string to uppercase changes its content, which may not be the intended operation when processing the insert operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.insert.charAt(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `charAt(0)` only retrieves the first character of the string, rather than a substring, which would alter the expected output of the operation.

DONE.
