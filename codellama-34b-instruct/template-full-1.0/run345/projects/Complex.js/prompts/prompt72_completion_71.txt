  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the code inside the `if` block would execute when `tokens` is not null, whereas the original code would execute when `tokens` is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof tokens !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code inside the `if` block would execute when `tokens` is not an object, whereas the original code would execute when `tokens` is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code inside the `if` block would execute when `tokens` is an empty array, whereas the original code would execute when `tokens` is not an empty array.

DONE.
