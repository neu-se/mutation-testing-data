Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the variable being used in the absolute value calculation from `x` to `y`, which could lead to incorrect results in the `hypot` function, especially when `x` and `y` are different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the value of `x` before taking the absolute value, which would alter the calculation of the hypotenuse, potentially leading to incorrect results when `x` is negative or small.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(x) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the absolute value of `x` by 2, which would incorrectly scale the value used in the hypotenuse calculation, leading to an inflated result.

DONE.
