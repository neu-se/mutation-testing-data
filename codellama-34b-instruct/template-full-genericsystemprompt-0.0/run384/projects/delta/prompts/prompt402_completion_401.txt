  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType !== Object.keys(otherData)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for equality, while this code checks for inequality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType === Object.keys(otherData)[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks the first key, while this code checks the second key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType === Object.keys(otherData)[0].toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks the key as is, while this code checks the key in uppercase.

DONE.
