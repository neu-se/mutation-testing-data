  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the less-than operator (<) to compare the index variable to the length property of the array, while the suggested code fragment uses the less-than-or-equal-to operator (<=) to compare the index variable to the length property of the array. This could result in different behavior if the array has a length of 0, as the original code fragment would not enter the loop in that case, while the suggested code fragment would.
