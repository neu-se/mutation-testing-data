  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
text.substring(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring() method returns a new string, and the original string is not modified.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
text.replace(/^/, ' ')
```
This would result in different behavior because the replace() method returns a new string with the specified replacement, and the original string is not modified.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
text.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the split() method returns an array of substrings, the reverse() method reverses the order of the elements in the array, and the join() method joins the elements of the array into a string.

DONE.
