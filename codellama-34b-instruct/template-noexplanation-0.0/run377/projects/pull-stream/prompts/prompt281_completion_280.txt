  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!mapper
```
This code fragment has different behavior than the original code fragment, which was `mapper`. The original code fragment will return the value of the `mapper` variable, while this code fragment will return the negation of the `mapper` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper + 1
```
This code fragment has different behavior than the original code fragment, which was `mapper`. The original code fragment will return the value of the `mapper` variable, while this code fragment will return the value of the `mapper` variable plus 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper * 2
```
This code fragment has different behavior than the original code fragment, which was `mapper`. The original code fragment will return the value of the `mapper` variable, while this code fragment will return the value of the `mapper` variable multiplied by 2.

DONE.
