  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount < 0
```
This change will cause the `all` function to resolve the promise as soon as the first promise in the array is resolved, regardless of whether the other promises have been resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount === promises.length
```
This change will cause the `all` function to resolve the promise as soon as all promises in the array have been resolved, regardless of whether any of the promises have been rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount === 0 && promises.length === 0
```
This change will cause the `all` function to resolve the promise as soon as all promises in the array have been resolved and the array is empty, regardless of whether any of the promises have been rejected.

DONE.
