  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, while `name` is a variable that may or may not be defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value, while `name` is a variable that may or may not be defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"name"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"name"` is a string literal, while `name` is a variable that may or may not be defined.

DONE.
