  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"send"
```
This would result in different behavior because "send" is a different operator than "throw", and it would cause the generator to continue iterating instead of propagating an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"next"
```
This would result in different behavior because "next" is a different operator than "throw", and it would cause the generator to continue iterating instead of propagating an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"reject"
```
This would result in different behavior because "reject" is a different operator than "throw", and it would cause the promise to be rejected instead of propagating an error.

DONE.
