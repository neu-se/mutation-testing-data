  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is not being called on the correct object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.resolve);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is not being called with the correct argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).fail(function () {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is not being called with a function that actually does something.

DONE.
