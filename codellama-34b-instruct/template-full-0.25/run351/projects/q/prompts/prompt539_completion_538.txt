  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the length property of the array, while this code fragment is using the length property of the arguments object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the length property of the arguments object, while this code fragment is using the length property of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the length property of the arguments object, while this code fragment is using the length property of the array minus one.

DONE.
