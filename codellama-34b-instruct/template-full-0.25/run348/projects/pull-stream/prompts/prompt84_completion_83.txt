  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a boolean value for the `abort` parameter, but `null` is a falsy value that would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false`, potentially causing the `read` function to be called with an invalid argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a boolean value for the `abort` parameter, but `undefined` is a falsy value that would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false`, potentially causing the `read` function to be called with an invalid argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a boolean value for the `abort` parameter, but `!abort` would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if `abort` is `false`, potentially causing the `read
