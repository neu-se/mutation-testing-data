  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` removes the first element of an array, whereas `pop` removes the last element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(1)` returns a new array containing all elements except the first, whereas `pop` returns the last element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `length - 1` returns the index of the last element, whereas `pop` returns the last element itself.

DONE.
