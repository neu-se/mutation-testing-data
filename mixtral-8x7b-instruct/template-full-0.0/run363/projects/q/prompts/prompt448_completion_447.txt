 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of referencing the `unhandledRejections` array, it creates a new empty array, which would not track unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unhandledRejections.length = unhandledRejections.length + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it increments the length of the `unhandledRejections` array instead of pushing a new item, which would not accurately track unhandled rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unhandledRejections.push(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it always pushes `null` into the `unhandledRejections` array, regardless of the reason. This would not provide accurate information about the reason for the unhandled rejection.

DONE.
