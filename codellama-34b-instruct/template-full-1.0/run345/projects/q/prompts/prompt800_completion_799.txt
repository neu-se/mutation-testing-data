  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(function (value) {
    clearTimeout(timeoutId);
    deferred.resolve(value);
}, function (exception) {
    clearTimeout(timeoutId);
    deferred.reject(exception);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clearTimeout` function is called twice, which is unnecessary and may cause unintended effects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(function (value) {
    setTimeout(function () {
        clearTimeout(timeoutId);
        deferred.resolve(value);
    }, ms);
}, function (exception) {
    clearTimeout(timeoutId);
    deferred.reject(exception);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setTimeout` function is used to delay the resolution of the promise, which may cause the promise to be rejected before it is resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then
