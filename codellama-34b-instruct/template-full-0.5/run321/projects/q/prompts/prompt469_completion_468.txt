  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons[at + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would refer to the next element in the `unhandledReasons` array, rather than the current element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons[at - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would refer to the previous element in the `unhandledReasons` array, rather than the current element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would refer to the length of the `unhandledReasons` array, rather than the current element.

DONE.
