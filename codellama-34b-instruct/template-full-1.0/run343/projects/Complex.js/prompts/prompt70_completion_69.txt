  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` is a different method than `match`, and it may return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `a[0]` is the first element of the string, whereas `match` returns an array of all matches.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.substr(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `substr` returns the substring starting at the specified index, whereas `match` returns an array of all matches.

DONE.
