  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method expects a function as its argument, and passing `null` would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method expects a function as its argument, and passing an empty function would cause the promise to be resolved with an empty value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(function(err) { throw err; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method expects a function as its argument, and passing a function that throws an error would cause the promise to be rejected with that error.

DONE.
