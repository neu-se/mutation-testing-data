  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan` is a different function than `Math.cos`, and would return the tangent of the input value instead of the cosine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` is a different function than `Math.cos`, and would return the sine of the input value instead of the cosine.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.acos` is the inverse of `Math.cos`, and would return the arccosine of the input value instead of the cosine.

DONE.
