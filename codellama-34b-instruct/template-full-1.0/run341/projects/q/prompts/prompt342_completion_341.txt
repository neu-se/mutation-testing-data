  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (done) {
    return value;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would cause the `return` statement to be executed only if `done` is truthy, whereas the original code fragment would always execute the `return` statement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (!done) {
    return;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would cause the `return` statement to be executed only if `done` is falsy, whereas the original code fragment would always execute the `return` statement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (done && false) {
    return;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would cause the `return` statement to be executed only if `done` is truthy and `false` is truthy, whereas the original code fragment would always execute the `return` statement.
