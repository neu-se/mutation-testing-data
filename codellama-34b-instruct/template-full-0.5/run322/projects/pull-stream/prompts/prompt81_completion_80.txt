  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'function' != typeof err
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `err` is a function, while the new code fragment checks if `err` is not a function. This would cause the `abort` function to behave differently in certain cases, potentially leading to test failures.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'object' == typeof err
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `err` is a function, while the new code fragment checks if `err` is an object. This would cause the `abort` function to behave differently in certain cases, potentially leading to test failures.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'undefined' == typeof err
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `err` is a function, while the new code fragment checks if `err` is undefined. This would cause the `abort` function to behave differently in certain cases,
