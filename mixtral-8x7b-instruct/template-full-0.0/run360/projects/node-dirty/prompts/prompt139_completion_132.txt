 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.length > 0 || err === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it reverses the condition, so the error will not be emitted even if there are callbacks and an error exists.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.length && err == null
