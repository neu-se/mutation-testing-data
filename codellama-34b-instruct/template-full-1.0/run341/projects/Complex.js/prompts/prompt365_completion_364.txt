  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh(a) + Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinh(a) + Math.sin(b)` produces a different result than `cosh(a) + Math.cos(b)` when `a` and `b` are non-zero values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh(a) * Math.sin(b) + Math.cos(b) * sinh(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cosh(a) * Math.sin(b) + Math.cos(b) * sinh(a)` produces a different result than `cosh(a) + Math.cos(b)` when `a` and `b` are non-zero values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(b) * sinh(a) + Math.cos(b) * cosh(a)
```
This would result
