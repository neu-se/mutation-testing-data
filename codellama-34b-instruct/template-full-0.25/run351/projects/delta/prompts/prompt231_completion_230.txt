  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add the lengths of the two iterators, potentially resulting in a larger value than the original code, which could cause the `diffResult` to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator would subtract the lengths of the two iterators, potentially resulting in a negative value, which could cause an error in the `diffResult`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() * length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would multiply the lengths of the two iterators, potentially resulting in a larger value than the original code, which could cause the `diffResult` to be incorrect.

DONE.
