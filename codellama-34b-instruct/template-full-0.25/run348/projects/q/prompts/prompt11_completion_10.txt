  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"test"
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return "test" instead of the expected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return 2 instead of the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return null instead of the expected value.

DONE.
