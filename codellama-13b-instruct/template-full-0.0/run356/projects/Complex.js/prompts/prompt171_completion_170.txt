  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero'](<PLACEHOLDER>) || z['isInfinite']()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has a higher precedence than the `&&` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(this['isZero'](<PLACEHOLDER>) || z['isInfinite']()) && (this['isInfinite']() || z['isZero']())`, which would result in a different outcome.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero'](<PLACEHOLDER>) && z['isInfinite']()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(this['isZero'](<PLACEHOLDER>) && z['isInfinite']()) || (this['isInfinite']() || z['isZero']())`, which would result in a different outcome.

Option 3
