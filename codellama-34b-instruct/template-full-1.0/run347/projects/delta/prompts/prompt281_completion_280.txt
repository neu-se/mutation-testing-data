  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.peekLength` will always be larger than or equal to 1, so the above code would result in a negative length, which would crash the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength * 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.peekLength` could be less than 2, which would result in a length of 0 or 1, which is not the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1;
```
This would result in a different behavior because it would result in a length of 0, which would cause a divide by zero error.

DONE.
