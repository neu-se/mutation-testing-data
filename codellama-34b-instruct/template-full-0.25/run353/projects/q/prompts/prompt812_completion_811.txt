  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall().then(function () {
    return value;
}).then(function () {
    throw new Error("Dummy error");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw a dummy error after the callback is done, which would cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall().then(function () {
    return value;
}).then(function () {
    return Q.reject(new Error("Dummy error"));
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a rejected promise with a dummy error after the callback is done, which would cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall().then(function () {
    return value;
}).then(function () {
    return Q.resolve(new Error("Dummy error"));
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a
