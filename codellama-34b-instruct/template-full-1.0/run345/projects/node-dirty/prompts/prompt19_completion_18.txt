  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, [cbs]
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `cbs` is a local variable, but in this modified code, it is replaced with an array literal, meaning that the callbacks are now called with an array containing a single callback function, whereas in the original code, the callbacks are called with a single callback function. 

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, cbs[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `cbs` is an array of callback functions, but in this modified code, only the first callback function in the array is called, whereas in the original code, all callback functions in the array are called. 

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, cbs
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the first argument `key` is used to store a value in the array, whereas in this modified code, the first argument is `
