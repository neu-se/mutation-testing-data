  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Buggy code");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error instead of calling the `flush` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("Buggy code");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would log a message to the console instead of calling the `flush` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return early instead of calling the `flush` function.

DONE.
