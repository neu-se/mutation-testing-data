 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the result of the sine function, which could lead to unexpected values in the complex plane.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the hyperbolic sine function instead of the regular sine function, which would lead to different results in the complex plane.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.asin
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the arcsine of the input, which is not the same as the sine of the arcsine, leading to incorrect results.

By introducing these changes, the mutation testing process can help identify potential weaknesses in the test suite and provide a starting point for improving it. DONE.
