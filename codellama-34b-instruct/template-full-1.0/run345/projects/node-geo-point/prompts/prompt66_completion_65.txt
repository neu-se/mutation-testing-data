  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(Δλ) * cos(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `atan2` is a trigonometric function that returns the arctangent of the ratio of its arguments, whereas `sin(Δλ) * cos(φ2)` is a product of two trigonometric functions and may not produce the same result as `atan2` for all inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ2) * tan(Δλ)
```
This would result in different behavior because `atan2` is a trigonometric function that returns the arctangent of the ratio of its arguments, whereas `cos(φ2) * tan(Δλ)` is a product of two trigonometric functions and may not produce the same result as `atan2` for all inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acos(Δλ) * (π - φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `
