  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value and does not have a `message` property, so `exception.message` would throw a `TypeError` instead of returning a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value and does not have a `message` property, so `exception.message` would throw a `TypeError` instead of returning a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"error"` is a string and does not have a `message` property, so `exception.message` would throw a `TypeError` instead of returning a string.

DONE.
