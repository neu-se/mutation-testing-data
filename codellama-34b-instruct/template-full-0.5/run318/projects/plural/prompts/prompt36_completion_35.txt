  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1, w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the wrong substring.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length, w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the wrong substring.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1, w.length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the wrong substring.

DONE.
