  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!read
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment will return the `read` variable unchanged, while the replaced code fragment will return the negation of `read`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment will return `read` unchanged, while the replaced code fragment will return `read` plus one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment will return `read` unchanged, while the replaced code fragment will return `read` times two.

DONE.
