  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Complex(
Math.expm1(a) * Math.cos(b) + Math.cosm1(b),
Math.exp(a) * Math.sin(b));
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of operations is different. In the original code, `Math.cosm1(b)` is added to `Math.expm1(a) * Math.cos(b)` before multiplying by `Math.exp(a)`, whereas in the replaced code, `Math.cosm1(b)` is added after multiplying by `Math.exp(a)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Complex(
Math.expm1(a) * Math.cosh(b) + Math.cosm1(b),
Math.exp(a) * Math.sinh(b));
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cosh` and `Math.sinh` are not the same as `Math.cos` and `Math
