  Sure, here are three possible mutations:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression === COMPRESSION_LEVEL.medium
```
This would result in different behavior because `medium` compression level would result in a different compression algorithm being used, which could produce a different output file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression === COMPRESSION_LEVEL.high + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `COMPRESSION_LEVEL. high + 1` is not a valid compression level, which would result in an error being thrown instead of a zip file being created.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression === COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed && o.compression !== COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would cause the condition to always be false, resulting in the `else` branch being
