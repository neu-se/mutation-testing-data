  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fulfill` method would be called with a different value than the original code, which could potentially cause the promise to resolve to a different value than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fulfill` method would be called with a different value than the original code, which could potentially cause the promise to resolve to a different value than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fulfill` method would be called with a different value than the original code, which could potentially cause the promise to resolve to a different value than expected.

DONE.
