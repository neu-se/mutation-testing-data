  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch(null, op, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid value for the `op` parameter, and passing it would cause the `dispatch` function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("get", args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `get` is not a valid value for the `op` parameter, and passing it would cause the `dispatch` function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [])
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array is not a valid value for the `args` parameter, and passing it would cause the `dispatch` function to throw an error.

DONE.
