  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
untrackRejection(this);
```
This would result in different behavior because `untrackRejection` is a function that removes a promise from the list of unhandled rejections, while `this` is a reference to the current object. In this case, `this` is a promise that is being rejected, so calling `untrackRejection` with `this` as an argument would remove the promise from the list of unhandled rejections, which is not the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
