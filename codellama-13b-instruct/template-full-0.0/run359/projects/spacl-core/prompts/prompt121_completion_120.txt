  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, ctx.path
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path` variable is now being compared to the `ctx.path` property, which may have a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, ctx.path.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path` variable is now being compared to the lowercase version of the `ctx.path` property, which may have a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, ctx.path.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path` variable is now being compared to the uppercase version of the `ctx.path` property, which may have a different value.

DONE.
