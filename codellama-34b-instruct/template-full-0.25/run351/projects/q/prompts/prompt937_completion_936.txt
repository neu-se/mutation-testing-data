  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return 1, regardless of the input arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return 0, regardless of the input arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return -1, regardless of the input arguments.

DONE.
