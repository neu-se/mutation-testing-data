  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, cbs);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was:
```
this._queue.set(key, cbs);
```
Which sets the value of the key to the list of callbacks, but the new code fragment sets the value of the key to the list of callbacks and then immediately sets it to `undefined`. This would cause the callbacks to never be called, which would result in different behavior.

DONE.
