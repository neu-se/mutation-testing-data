  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.match
```
This would result in different behavior because `key.match` is a different method than `key.exec`, and it may not produce the same results as the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.test
```
This would result in different behavior because `key.test` is a different method than `key.exec`, and it may not produce the same results as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `key.search` is a different method than `key.exec`, and it may not produce the same results as the original code.

DONE.
