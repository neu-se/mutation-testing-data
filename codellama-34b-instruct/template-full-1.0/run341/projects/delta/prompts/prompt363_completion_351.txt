  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasPrevious()
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasPrevious()` returns `true` if there is an element preceding the current position in the iteration, whereas `hasNext()` returns `true` if there is an element following the current position in the iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because `!otherIter.hasNext()` returns `true` if there is no element following the current position in the iteration, whereas `otherIter.hasPrevious()` returns `true` if there is an element preceding the current position in the iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.index < other.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the index of the `otherIter` element in `other.ops` array, and returns `true` if the index is less than the length of the array. However, `otherIter.
