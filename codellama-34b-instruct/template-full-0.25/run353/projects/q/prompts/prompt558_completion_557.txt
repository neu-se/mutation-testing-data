  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add 1 to the value of `arg`, whereas the original code fragment simply passes the value of `arg` as is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would multiply the value of `arg` by 2, whereas the original code fragment simply passes the value of `arg` as is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator would subtract 1 from the value of `arg`, whereas the original code fragment simply passes the value of `arg` as is.

DONE.
