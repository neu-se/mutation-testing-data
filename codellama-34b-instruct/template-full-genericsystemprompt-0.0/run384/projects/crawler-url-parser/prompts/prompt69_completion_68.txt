  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sourceUrl.replace(/^https?:\/\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the protocol from the URL, while this replacement code fragment removes the protocol and the double slashes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sourceUrl.replace(/^https?:\/\//, 'http://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the protocol from the URL, while this replacement code fragment replaces the protocol with "http://".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sourceUrl.replace(/^https?:\/\//, 'https://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the protocol from the URL, while this replacement code fragment replaces the protocol with "https://".

DONE.
