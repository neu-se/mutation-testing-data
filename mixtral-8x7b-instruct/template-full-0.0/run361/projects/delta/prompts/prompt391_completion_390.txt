 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.next.bind(thisIter)()
```
This would result in different behavior because it immediately invokes the `next` method and passes the result to `thisOp`, instead of assigning the `next` method to `thisOp`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.next.call(thisIter)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the `next` method with the `this` value set to `thisIter`, but it doesn't actually execute the returned operation, instead of assigning the `next` method to `thisOp`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the next operation without advancing the iterator, instead of assigning the `next` method to `thisOp`.

DONE.
