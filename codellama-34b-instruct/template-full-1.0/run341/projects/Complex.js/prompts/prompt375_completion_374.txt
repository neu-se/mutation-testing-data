  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a+b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `cosh` which is a hyperbolic cosine function, while `a+b` would result in a different calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(a+b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `cosh` which is a hyperbolic cosine function, while `Math.sin` is a sine function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(a+b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `cosh` which is a hyperbolic cosine function, while `Math.exp` is an exponential function.

DONE.
