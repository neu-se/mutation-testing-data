  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base[key] !== attr[key] || attr[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is used instead of the `&&` operator, which would cause the `attr[key] === undefined` condition to always be evaluated, even if `base[key] !== attr[key]` is already true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base[key] !== attr[key] && attr[key] !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value is explicitly checked for, which would cause the `attr[key] !== undefined` condition to always be false if `attr[key]` is null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base[key] !== attr[key] && attr[key] !== undefined && attr[key] !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attr[key] !== undefined` and `attr[key] !== null` conditions are both
