  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a != undefined && a != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if `a` is not `undefined` or `null`, regardless of its value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a special value in JavaScript that is not equal to anything, including itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` if `a` is an empty array, but not if it is any other empty object or a string.

DONE.
