Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/^www\.([a-z\-\d]{1,64})\.([a-z\.]{1,6})$/.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression now allows for hostnames with labels of length 1-64 and extensions of length 1-6, which is different from the original constraints of 2-63 for labels and 2-5 for extensions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/^[a-z\-\d]{2,63}\.([a-z\.]{2,5})$/.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression no longer checks for the presence of "www." at the start of the hostname, which could lead to incorrect removal of "www." from hostnames that do not start with it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
urlObj.hostname === 'www'
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition now checks for an exact match with the string "www", rather than checking if the hostname starts with "www." followed by a valid domain
