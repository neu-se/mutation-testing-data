```
This code fragment will cause the `output.on('close', <PLACEHOLDER>)` event to be triggered, but it will reject the promise instead of resolving it. This can cause the `zip` or `tar` function to return an error instead of the expected result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This code fragment will cause the `output.on('close', <PLACEHOLDER>)` event to be triggered, but it will resolve the promise with an error instead of the expected result. This can cause the `zip` or `tar` function to return an error instead of the expected result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This code fragment will cause the `output.on('close', <PLACEHOLDER>)` event to be triggered, but it will resolve the promise with `null` instead of the expected result. This can cause
