 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!thisOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the condition, causing the code to continue if the current operation is a delete operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the current operation has an insert property, which is not the same as checking if it's a delete operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisOp.hasOwnProperty('delete')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the delete property exists in the current operation object, rather than checking the actual value of the property.

DONE.
