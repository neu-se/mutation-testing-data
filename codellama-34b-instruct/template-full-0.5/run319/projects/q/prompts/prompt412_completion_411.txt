  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state !== "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the state is fulfilled, while this new code fragment checks if the state is not fulfilled. This would cause the code to behave differently in the case where the promise is fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the state is fulfilled, while this new code fragment checks if the state is rejected. This would cause the code to behave differently in the case where the promise is rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the state is fulfilled, while this new code fragment checks if the state is pending. This would cause the code to behave differently in the case where the promise is pending.

DONE.
