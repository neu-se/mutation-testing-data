  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reset the offset to 0, causing the iterator to always return the first element in the list.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const offset = this.offset;
this.offset = offset + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the offset by 1, causing the iterator to skip the first element in the list and return the second element instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset = -1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the offset to -1, causing the iterator to return the last element in the list instead of the first.

DONE.
