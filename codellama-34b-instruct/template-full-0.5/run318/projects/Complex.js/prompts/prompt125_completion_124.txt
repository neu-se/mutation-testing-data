  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return `Complex['INFINITY']`, regardless of the values of `a` and `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return `Complex['INFINITY']` when `z` is zero, regardless of the value of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return `Complex['INFINITY']` when `z` is zero and `a` is infinite, regardless of the value of `b`.

DONE.
