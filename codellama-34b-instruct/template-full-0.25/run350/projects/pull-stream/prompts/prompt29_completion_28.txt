  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `switch` statement would not be executed for the case where `length` is 3, and the `default` case would be executed instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `switch` statement would not be executed for the case where `length` is 4, and the `default` case would be executed instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `switch` statement would not be executed for the case where `length` is 1, and the `default` case would be executed instead.

DONE.
