  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `line.length` is a number, while `line` is a string, and `line.length` would return the length of the string, while `line` would return the string itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `line[0]` would return the first character of the string, while `line` would return the entire string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `line.toUpperCase()` would return the string in uppercase, while `line` would return the string in its original case.

DONE.
