 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` function would return a promise that is always resolved, instead of returning the original promise object, which allows chaining additional `.progress()` calls.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject(new Error('Mocked failure'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` function would always reject the returned promise with a mocked error, instead of forwarding the progress notifications from the original promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` function would return a newly created empty function, instead of forwarding the progress notifications from the original promise.

DONE.
