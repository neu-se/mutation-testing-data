  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` function is not defined in the code snippet, and therefore, the code would throw a `ReferenceError` when the `abort` function is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value is not a function, and therefore, the code would throw a `TypeError` when the `null` value is called as a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value is not a function, and therefore, the code would throw a `TypeError` when the `undefined` value is called as a function.

DONE.
