  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the `src` string into an array of substrings using the comma character as the separator, while this new code fragment only takes the first substring from the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the `src` string into an array of substrings using the comma character as the separator, while this new code fragment only takes the last substring from the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',').slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the `src` string into an array of substrings using the comma character as the separator, while this new code fragment takes all but the first substring from the array.

DONE.
