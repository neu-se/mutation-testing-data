  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort, abort, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments has been changed. The original code fragment calls `abortCb` with `cb` as the first argument, followed by `abort` and `onAbort`. In this modified version, `onAbort` is passed as the first argument, which could cause a different behavior if the function implementation relies on the order of the arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, abort, 42
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument passed to `abortCb` is now a constant value (42) instead of the `onAbort` function. This could cause a different behavior if the function implementation relies on the value of the third argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, abort, onAbort
```
This would result in no different behavior, because the modified code is the same as the original code.
