  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition operator would cause the promise to be resolved with a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction operator would cause the promise to be resolved with a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operator would cause the promise to be resolved with a different value.

DONE.
