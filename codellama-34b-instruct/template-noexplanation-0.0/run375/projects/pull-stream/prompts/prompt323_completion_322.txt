  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd(abort === true ? null : abort)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code fragment, but it uses the `onEnd` function instead of the `op` function. This change may cause the test suite to fail if the `onEnd` function is not properly tested.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op(abort === true ? null : abort)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code fragment, but it uses the `op` function instead of the `onEnd` function. This change may cause the test suite to fail if the `op` function is not properly tested.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd(abort === false ? null : abort)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code fragment, but it uses the `onEnd` function instead of the `op` function and it checks the opposite condition of the original code fragment. This change may cause the test suite to fail if the
