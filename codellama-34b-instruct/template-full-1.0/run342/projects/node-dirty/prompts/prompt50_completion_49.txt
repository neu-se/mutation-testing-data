  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(key) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would change the value being updated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(key).length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would update the value with the length of the string, rather than the string itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would update the value with a random number, rather than the original value.

DONE.
