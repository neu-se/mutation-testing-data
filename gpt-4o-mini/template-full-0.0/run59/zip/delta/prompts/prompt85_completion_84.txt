Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it compares the new operation's attributes to the last operation's attributes instead of the new operation's attributes, which could lead to incorrect merging of operations if the last operation's attributes are not the same as the new operation's.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to false in the equality check, causing the merging logic to be skipped entirely, which could lead to unexpected results in the operations array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also always evaluate to false in the equality check, similar to using `null`, and would prevent the merging of operations based on attributes, potentially leading to a larger operations array than intended.

DONE.
