  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fcall` is a method that calls a function with a given context and arguments, but it does not return a promise. In the original code, `then` is called on the return value of `callback.fcall`, which is a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(value).thenResolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `thenResolve` is a method that returns a promise that is resolved with the given value. In the original code, `then` is called on the return value of `callback.fcall`, which is a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(value).thenReject(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `thenReject` is a method that returns a promise that is rejected with the given value. In the original code, `then` is called
