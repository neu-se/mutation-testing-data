  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key = 1
```
This would result in an infinite loop because the value of `key` is now fixed to `1`, causing the `object_keys` function to iterate indefinitely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key - 1
```
This would result in a decreasing loop because the value of `key` is now subtracted by `1` each time it is iterated, causing the `object_keys` function to iterate fewer times than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in an increasing loop because the value of `key` is now added by `1` each time it is iterated, causing the `object_keys` function to iterate more times than expected.

DONE.
