  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.invert(opData, baseOpData)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `invert` method on the `handler` object with the `opData` and `baseOpData` arguments, which would likely have a different effect than calling the `invert` method with no arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.invert(baseOpData, opData)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `invert` method on the `handler` object with the `baseOpData` and `opData` arguments in reverse order, which could potentially have a different effect than calling the method with the arguments in the original order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.invert(opData, baseOpData, priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `invert` method on the `handler` object with an additional `priority` argument,
