  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve()` method is called with a value of `null`, rather than the expected `value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve([value]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve()` method is called with an array containing the expected `value`, rather than the `value` itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(function() { return value; });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve()` method is called with a function that returns the expected `value`, rather than the `value` itself.

DONE.
