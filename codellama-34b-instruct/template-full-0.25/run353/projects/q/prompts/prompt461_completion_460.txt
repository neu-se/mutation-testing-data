  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.emit` is a function, and `typeof process.emit === "function"` would evaluate to `true`, while `process.emit === "function"` would evaluate to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process.emit !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.emit` is a function, and `typeof process.emit === "function"` would evaluate to `true`, while `typeof process.emit !== "function"` would evaluate to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.emit` is a function, and `typeof process.emit === "function"` would evaluate to `true`, while `process.emit !== "function"` would evaluate to `false`.

DONE.
