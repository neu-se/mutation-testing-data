  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp.unshift(this);
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisp` is not defined, and `unshift` is not a method of `this`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.push(thisp);
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisp` is not defined, and `push` is not a method of `this`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp.concat(this);
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisp` is not defined, and `concat` is not a method of `this`.

DONE.
