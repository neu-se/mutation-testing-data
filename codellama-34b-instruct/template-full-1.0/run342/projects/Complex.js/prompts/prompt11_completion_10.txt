  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` is a different function than `Math.exp`, and would return a different value for the given input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` is another different function than `Math.exp`, and would also return a different value for the given input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan` is yet another different function than `Math.exp`, and would also return a different value for the given input.

DONE.
