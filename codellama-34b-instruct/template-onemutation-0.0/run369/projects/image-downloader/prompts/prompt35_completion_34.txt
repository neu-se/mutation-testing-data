  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.pipe(createWriteStream(dest))
```
This would result in different behavior because `res.pipe` is a method that pipes the response data to a destination stream, whereas `createWriteStream(dest)` creates a new write stream to the file specified by `dest`. Using `res.pipe` instead of `createWriteStream(dest)` would result in the response data being written to the file specified by `dest`, but it would not create a new write stream to that file.

DONE.
