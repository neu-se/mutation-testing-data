  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"+++"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prepend "+++" to the property key, resulting in a different property name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"+"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append "+" to the property key, resulting in a different property name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"_"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the property key with an underscore, resulting in a different property name.

DONE.
