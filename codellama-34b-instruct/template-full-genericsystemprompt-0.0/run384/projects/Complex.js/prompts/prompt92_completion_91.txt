  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + '0'
```
This would result in different behavior because the constant value is different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + '2'
```
This would result in different behavior because the constant value is different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + 'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the constant value is a string, not a number.

DONE.
