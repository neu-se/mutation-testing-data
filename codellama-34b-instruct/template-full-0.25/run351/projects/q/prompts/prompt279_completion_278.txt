  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` would be different, which would affect the resulting array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument to `array_slice` would be different, which would affect the resulting array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument to `array_slice` would be different, which would affect the resulting array.

DONE.
