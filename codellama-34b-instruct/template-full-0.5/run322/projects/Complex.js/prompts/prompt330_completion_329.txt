  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the value of `b` as it is, but this replacement would add 1 to the value of `b`, which could cause the program to behave differently in certain cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the value of `b` as it is, but this replacement would negate the value of `b`, which could cause the program to behave differently in certain cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the value of `b` as it is, but this replacement would double the value of `b`, which could cause the program to behave differently in certain cases.

DONE.
