  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
4 + 4
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition operation produces a different value than the original `value` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string literal `"hello"` is different from the original `value` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value is different from the original `value` variable.

DONE.
