  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
regex, 'ves'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the string "ves" regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
regex, 'ves' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the string "vess" regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
regex, 'ves' + w
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the string "ves" followed by the input string, regardless of the input.

DONE.
