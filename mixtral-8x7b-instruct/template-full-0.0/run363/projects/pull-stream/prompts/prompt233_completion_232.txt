 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.test
```
This would result in different behavior because it now checks the existence of a 'test' property in the data object, instead of checking the value of the 'test' variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test || true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true, effectively disabling the filtering functionality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the condition, causing the filter to behave inversely.

DONE.
