  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a method that invokes a function with a given `this` value and arguments, while `apply` is a method that invokes a function with a given `this` value and an array of arguments. Using `call` instead of `apply` would cause the function to be invoked with the wrong `this` value, leading to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
