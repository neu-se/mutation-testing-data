  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by 2 would cause the real part of the complex number to be doubled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 would cause the real part of the complex number to be increased by 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the imaginary part of the complex number would be used instead of the real part.

DONE.
