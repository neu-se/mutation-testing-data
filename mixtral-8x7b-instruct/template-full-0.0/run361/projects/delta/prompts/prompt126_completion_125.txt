 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > start
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison is now checking if the index is greater than the start, which would reverse the order of the elements in the slice.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index >= start
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison is now checking if the index is greater than or equal to the start, which would exclude the element at the start position in the slice.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + length < start
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison is now checking if the sum of the index and the length is less than the start, which would exclude elements from the slice based on the length of the previous elements.

DONE.
