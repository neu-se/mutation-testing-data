  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is used as an argument to the `once` function, which expects a boolean value. By adding 1 to `end`, the function will be called with a non-boolean value, which may cause it to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is used as an argument to the `once` function, which expects a boolean value. By subtracting 1 from `end`, the function will be called with a non-boolean value, which may cause it to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is used as an argument to the `once` function, which expects a boolean value. By negating `end`, the function will be called with a different boolean value, which may cause it to behave differently.
