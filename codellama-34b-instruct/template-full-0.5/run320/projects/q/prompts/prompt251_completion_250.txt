  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.longStackSupport && !hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!hasStacks` would negate the `hasStacks` variable, causing the `promise.stack` property to be assigned a value even if the `Q.longStackSupport` is not enabled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.longStackSupport || hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would cause the `promise.stack` property to be assigned a value if either the `Q.longStackSupport` or `hasStacks` is enabled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.longStackSupport ? hasStacks : !hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because the ternary operator would cause the `promise.stack` property to be assigned a value if the `Q.longStackSupport` is enabled and the `hasStacks` variable is truthy,
