 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the result changes, as it becomes positive. This is because the original code fragment, `b`, is squared in the original code, which results in a positive value regardless of the sign of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the result changes, as it becomes negative. This is because the original code fragment, `b`, is used as-is in the original code, which preserves its sign.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a division by zero error when `b` is equal to zero. In the original code, `b` is squared, so it never results in a division by zero error.

DONE.
