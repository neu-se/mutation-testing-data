  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred` is not a function and would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer()` is not a function and would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer.promise` is not a function and would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
