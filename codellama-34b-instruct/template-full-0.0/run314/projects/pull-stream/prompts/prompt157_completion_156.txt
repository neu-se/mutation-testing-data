  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_value
```
This would result in different behavior because `_value` is a different variable than `value`, and it may not have the same value or behavior as `value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `value + 1` is a different expression than `value`, and it may not have the same value or behavior as `value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `value`, and it may not have the same behavior as `value`.

DONE.
