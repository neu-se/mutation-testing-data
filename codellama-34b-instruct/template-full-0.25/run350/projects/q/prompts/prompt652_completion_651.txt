  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would start from the second argument instead of the third, which could cause the `dispatch` method to receive the wrong arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 0, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would only include the first two arguments, which could cause the `dispatch` method to receive incomplete arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 2, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would only include the third argument, which could cause the `dispatch` method to receive incomplete arguments.

DONE.
