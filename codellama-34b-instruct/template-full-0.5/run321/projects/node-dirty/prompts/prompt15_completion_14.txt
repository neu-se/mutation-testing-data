  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would not be called, which could cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be called with an empty object, which could cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { throw new Error('test error'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would throw an error, which could cause the test to fail.

DONE.
