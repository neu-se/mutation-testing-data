  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
all
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` is a built-in function in JavaScript that returns a promise that resolves when all of the promises in an array have resolved, whereas `when` is a built-in function in JavaScript that returns a promise that resolves or rejects based on the first argument, which can be either a promise or a regular value. In the context of the code, using `all` would cause the function to return a promise that resolves when all of the promises in the `args` array have resolved, rather than a promise that resolves or rejects based on the first argument in the `args` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
any
```
This would result in different behavior because `any` is a built-in function in JavaScript that returns a promise that resolves when any of the promises in an array have resolved, whereas `when` is a built-in function in JavaScript that returns a promise that resolves or rejects based on the first argument, which can be either a promise
