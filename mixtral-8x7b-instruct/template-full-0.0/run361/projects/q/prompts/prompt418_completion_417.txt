 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPending` function would always return true for the given object, even if it's not a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPending` function would return true for `null` values, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return "pending"; }
