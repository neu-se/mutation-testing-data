  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function would be called instead of the `reject` function, which would result in a successful promise resolution instead of a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 resolve({filename: 'foo'});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function would be called with a different argument, which would result in a successful promise resolution with a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error();
```
This would result in different behavior because an error would be thrown instead of a promise rejection, which would result in a failed promise.

DONE.
