  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
123
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `Q.master` is not defined in the provided code snippet, and using the number `123` would result in a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `Q.master` is not defined in the provided code snippet, and using `undefined` would result in a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, which would be executed instead of the intended behavior of the `Q.master` function.

DONE.
