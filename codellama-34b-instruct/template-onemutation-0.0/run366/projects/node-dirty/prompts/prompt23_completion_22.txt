  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { if (cb) cb(); this.emit('drain', 1); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is called with an additional argument `1`, which would cause the `drain` event to be emitted with a different value than the original code.
