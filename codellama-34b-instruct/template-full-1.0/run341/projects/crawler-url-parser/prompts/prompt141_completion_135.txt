  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.path.replace(/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a word boundary `\b` to ensure that only the last part of the path matches the pattern, while the replacement pattern does not have a word boundary, which could cause the pattern to match anywhere in the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.path.replace(/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '!/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment captures the part of the path before the default file, while the replacement pattern captures the part of the path after the default file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.path.replace(/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '!_')
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement pattern uses a different character (`!_`) to indicate that the path should be relative
