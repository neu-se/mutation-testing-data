 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.r === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for null values, which might not have the same effect as checking for undefined, especially if the `r` property can be explicitly set to null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'r' in tz
