  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!trackUnhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the condition, making the code track unhandled rejections instead of ignoring them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections && Q.delay(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delay the processing of unhandled rejections by one tick, potentially allowing additional rejections to be tracked before they are handled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections && Q.nextTick.delay(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delay the processing of unhandled rejections by one tick, potentially allowing additional rejections to be tracked before they are handled, and using the `Q.nextTick` method instead of the `Q.delay` method.

DONE.
