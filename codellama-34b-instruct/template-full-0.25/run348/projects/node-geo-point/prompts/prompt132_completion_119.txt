  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile` method would receive a `null` value as the `coordinate` parameter, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile` method would receive an `undefined` value as the `coordinate` parameter, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ latitude: 0, longitude: 0 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile` method would receive a different `coordinate` object with latitude and longitude values of 0, which would likely cause the method to return a different tile value.

DONE.
