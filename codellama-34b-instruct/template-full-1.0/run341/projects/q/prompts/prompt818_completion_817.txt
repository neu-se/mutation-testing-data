  Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` argument is not the second argument in the original function signature, and it would cause an error in the function call.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as the original `rejected` argument, and it would cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not the same as the original `rejected` argument, and it would cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
