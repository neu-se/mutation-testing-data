  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin(φ2)` would return the sine of `φ2`, which is not the same as `Math.cos(φ2)` which is the call to the cosine function with `φ2` as its argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan(φ2)` would return the tangent of `φ2`, which is not the same as `Math.cos(φ2)` which is the call to the cosine function with `φ2` as its argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.acos(φ2)` would return the inverse cosine of `φ2`, which is not the same as `Math.cos(φ2)` which is the call to
