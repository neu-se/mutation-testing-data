  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  Object.keys(newOp).length
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys(newOp).length` will always be `1`, while `Object.keys(attributes).length` will be the number of keys in the `attributes` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  Object.keys(attributes)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys(attributes)[0]` would be the first key in the `attributes` object, while `Object.keys(newOp).length` would be the number of keys in the `newOp` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  typeof newOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof newOp.attributes` would return "object" or "undefined", while `Object.keys(attributes).length` would be the number of keys in the `attributes` object.

DONE.
