  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to return the wrong substring, which would lead to a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to return an incorrect substring, which would lead to a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to return a substring that is twice as long as the original substring, which would lead to a different output.

DONE.
