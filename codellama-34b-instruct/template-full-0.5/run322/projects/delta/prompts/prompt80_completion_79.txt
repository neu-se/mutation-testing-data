  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.insert != null
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastOp.insert` is a string, and `null` is an object, so the comparison would always return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.insert !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastOp.insert` is a string, and `undefined` is a primitive value, so the comparison would always return `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.insert != undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastOp.insert` is a string, and `undefined` is a primitive value, so the comparison would always return `false`.

DONE.
