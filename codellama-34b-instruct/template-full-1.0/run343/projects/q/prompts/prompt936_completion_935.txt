  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments.length` is a different value than `arguments`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments[0]` is a different value than `arguments`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `arguments`.

DONE.
