  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
min = max
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to always assign the same value to `min` and `max`, regardless of the actual values of those variables.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max = min
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to always assign the same value to `min` and `max`, regardless of the actual values of those variables.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
min = max + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to always assign a value to `min` that is one greater than the value of `max`, regardless of the actual values of those variables.

DONE.
