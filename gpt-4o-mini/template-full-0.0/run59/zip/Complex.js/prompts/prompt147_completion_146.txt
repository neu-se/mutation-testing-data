Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly treat the case where one of the complex numbers is zero as resulting in NaN, instead of checking if either number is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the current complex number (the one calling the method) is zero, rather than checking if the second complex number `z` is infinite, potentially leading to incorrect results in multiplication.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']() && this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return NaN if both the current complex number is zero and the second complex number is infinite, which is a more restrictive condition than the original check for either being infinite.

DONE.
