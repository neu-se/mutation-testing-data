  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reason` argument would be passed to `deferred.resolve()`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reason` argument would be passed to `deferred.reject()`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reason` argument would be passed to `deferred.notify()`, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
