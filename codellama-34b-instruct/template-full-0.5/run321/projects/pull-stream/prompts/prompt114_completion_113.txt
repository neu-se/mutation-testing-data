  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the error is truthy, but replacing it with `null` would make the condition always false, causing the callback to be called with `null` as the error argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the error is truthy, but replacing it with `undefined` would make the condition always false, causing the callback to be called with `undefined` as the error argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the error is truthy, but replacing it with `false` would make the condition always false, causing the callback to be called with `false` as the error argument.

DONE.
