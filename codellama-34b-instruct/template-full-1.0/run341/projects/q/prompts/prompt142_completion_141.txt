  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise; !p; p = p.source
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra negation operator is added to the code, which would cause the loop to run an extra time.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise; null !== p; p = p.source
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop condition is changed from a simple negation of the `p` variable to a strict inequality comparison between `p` and `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise; p !== null; p = p.source
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the operands in the inequality comparison is reversed, which would cause the loop to run an extra time.

DONE.
