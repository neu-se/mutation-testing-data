  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the Boolean value `true` is always truthy, so the `if` statement would always be executed, even if the input is an empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the Boolean value `false` is always falsy, so the `if` statement would never be executed, even if the input is a non-empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Boolean(obj)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator inverts the truthiness of the expression `Boolean(obj)`, so the `if` statement would be executed if and only if the input is not a boolean value.

DONE.
