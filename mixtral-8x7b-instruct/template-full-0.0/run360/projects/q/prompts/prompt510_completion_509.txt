 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method expects an array-like object as its second argument, and an empty array would not provide the expected arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method expects an array-like object as its second argument, and `null` would not provide the expected arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments` is a special identifier that provides access to the arguments passed to the current function. In this case, it would not provide the expected array-like object for the `apply` method.

DONE.
