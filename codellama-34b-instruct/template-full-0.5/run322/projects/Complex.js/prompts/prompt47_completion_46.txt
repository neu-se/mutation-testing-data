  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'abs' in a || 'arg' in a
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always return true, even if the object does not have the required properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'abs' in a && 'arg' in b
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would check if the properties are in different objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'abs' in a || 'arg' in b
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would return true if either property is in either object.

DONE.
