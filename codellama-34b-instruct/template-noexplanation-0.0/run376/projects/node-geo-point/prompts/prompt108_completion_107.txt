  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom + 1
```
This code fragment will increase the value of the `zoom` variable by 1, which will cause the `toTile` function to return a different tile coordinate.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom - 1
```
This code fragment will decrease the value of the `zoom` variable by 1, which will cause the `toTile` function to return a different tile coordinate.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * zoom
```
This code fragment will double the value of the `zoom` variable, which will cause the `toTile` function to return a different tile coordinate.

DONE.
