  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData
```
This would result in different behavior because the `opData` variable is not defined in the context of the `invert` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOpData
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseOpData` variable is not defined in the context of the `invert` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getDelta(opData)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getDelta` function is not defined in the `Delta` class.

DONE.
