  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pendingCount` variable is only decremented when a promise is rejected, so if it is negative, it means that all promises have been rejected, and the function should return a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount === promises.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pendingCount` variable is only incremented when a promise is fulfilled, so if it is equal to the length of the `promises` array, it means that all promises have been fulfilled, and the function should return a fulfilled promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because if the `promises` array is empty, the function should return a fulfilled promise immediately, without waiting for any promises to be fulfilled or rejected.

DONE.
