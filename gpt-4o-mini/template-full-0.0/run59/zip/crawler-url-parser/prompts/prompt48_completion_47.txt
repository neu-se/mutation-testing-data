Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.format(parsedBaseUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly format the base URL instead of resolving the current URL against the base URL, potentially leading to incorrect URL parsing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the second argument of `URL.parse` from `true` to `false`, which alters the way the URL is parsed, specifically affecting the handling of the query string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve(parsedBaseUrl, parsedUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `URL.resolve` instead of `URL.parse`, which would not return a parsed URL object but rather a string representing the resolved URL, leading to potential issues in subsequent processing.

DONE.
