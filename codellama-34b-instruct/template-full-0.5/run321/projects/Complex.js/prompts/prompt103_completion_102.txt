  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus > minus
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to true when `plus` is greater than `minus`, regardless of the value of `plus + minus`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
minus > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to true when `minus` is positive, regardless of the value of `plus + minus`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus == 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to true when `plus + minus` is equal to 1, regardless of the value of `plus` and `minus`.

DONE.
