  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async()()
```
This would result in different behavior because the extra parentheses would cause the function to be called twice, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(function(){})
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be called with a different argument, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(function(){ return Q.async(); })
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a promise for a promise, potentially leading to unexpected results.

DONE.
