  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rule[0]` is a regular expression, and the `rule[1]` is a function. By replacing `rule[1]` with `rule[0]`, the function would be called with a regular expression as an argument, which would likely cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1](word)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rule[1]` is a function, and the `word` is a string. By replacing `rule[1]` with `rule[1](word)`, the function would be called with a string as an argument, which would likely cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1](word, rule[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rule[1]` is a function, and the `word` and `rule[0]` are both strings. By replacing `rule[1]`
