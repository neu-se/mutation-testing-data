  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] + this['re']
```
This change will cause the `equals` method to always return `true`, regardless of the values of `a` and `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] * this['re']
```
This change will cause the `equals` method to always return `false`, regardless of the values of `a` and `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] / this['re']
```
This change will cause the `equals` method to always return `false`, unless `a` and `b` are both equal to `0`.

DONE.
