  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation operator `-` would cause the function to return the opposite value of what it should be, potentially causing errors in the calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be returning the sine of the angle instead of the cosine, which could lead to errors in the calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be returning the tangent of the angle instead of the cosine, which could lead to errors in the calculations.

DONE.
