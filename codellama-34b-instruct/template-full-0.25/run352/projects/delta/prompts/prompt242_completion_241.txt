  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the other iterator instead of the current iterator, which could lead to incorrect results in the diff algorithm.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the length of the current iterator, which could lead to incorrect results in the diff algorithm.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the length of the other iterator, which could lead to incorrect results in the diff algorithm.

DONE.
