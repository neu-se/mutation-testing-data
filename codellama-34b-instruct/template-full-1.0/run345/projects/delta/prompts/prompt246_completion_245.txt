  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.delete(Null_CHARACTER);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Null_CHARACTER` is a string with length 1, which would cause the string to be retained and then deleted, whereas the original code fragment `retDelta.delete` would delete the entire retained string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.insert(Null_CHARACTER);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Null_CHARACTER` is a string with length 1, which would cause the string to be inserted and then retained, whereas the original code fragment `retDelta.delete` would delete the entire retained string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.retain(Null_CHARACTER.length);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Null_CHARACTER.length` is equal to 1, which would cause the string to be retained and then deleted, whereas the original code fragment `retDelta
