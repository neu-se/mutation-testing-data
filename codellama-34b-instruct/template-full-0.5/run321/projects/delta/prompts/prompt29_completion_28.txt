  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `base.length` is a number, while `base` is an object, and the `reduce` method expects an object as its accumulator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because `base[key]` is a property of the `base` object, while `base` is an object, and the `reduce` method expects an object as its accumulator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base[key] = attr[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it assigns a value to the `base` object, which is not allowed in the `reduce` method.

DONE.
