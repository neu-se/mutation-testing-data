  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` returns the square root of a number, while `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(10, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.pow(10, b)` returns 10 raised to the power of `b`, while `Math.abs(b)` returns the absolute value of `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because `b * b` returns the square of `b`, while `Math.abs(b)` returns the absolute value of `b`.

DONE.
