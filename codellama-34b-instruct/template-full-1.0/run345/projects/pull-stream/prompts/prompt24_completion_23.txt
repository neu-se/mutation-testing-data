  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be pulling the wrong element from the arguments array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const newRef = ref.slice(1)
newRef[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be pulling the wrong element from the modified array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be pulling the wrong element from the arguments array.

DONE.
