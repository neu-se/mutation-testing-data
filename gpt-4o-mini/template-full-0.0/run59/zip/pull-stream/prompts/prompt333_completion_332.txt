Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of calling the callback function `cb` with the data, it logs the data to the console, which means the downstream consumers of the stream will not receive the data as expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly passes `null` as the first argument to the callback, indicating no error, which may not align with the original intent of handling the `end` condition properly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes `end` as the first argument and `null` as the second, which could lead to incorrect handling of the data since the second argument (data) is expected to be the actual data read from the stream.

DONE.
