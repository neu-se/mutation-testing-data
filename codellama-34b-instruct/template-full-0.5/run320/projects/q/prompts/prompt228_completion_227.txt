  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.push(args);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the arguments array onto the messages array, rather than the individual arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.push(args[0]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the first argument onto the messages array, rather than the entire arguments array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.push(args[1]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the second argument onto the messages array, rather than the entire arguments array.

DONE.
