  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `array_slice.call(arguments, 1)` is a function that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, starting from the second element.

DONE.
