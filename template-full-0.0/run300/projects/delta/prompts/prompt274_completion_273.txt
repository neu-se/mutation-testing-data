  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next operation is not an insert, while this replacement checks if the next operation is a delete.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next operation is not an insert, while this replacement checks if the next operation has a length greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next operation is not an insert, while this replacement checks if the next operation is a retain.

DONE.
