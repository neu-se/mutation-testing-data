  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(null, null, progressed)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the progressed callback to be called for both fulfilled and rejected promises, whereas the original code only called it for fulfilled promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(null, null, function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the progressed callback to be called with an empty function, whereas the original code called it with the `progressed` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(null, null, function(value) { return value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the progressed callback to be called with a function that returns its argument, whereas the original code called it with the `progressed` argument.

DONE.
