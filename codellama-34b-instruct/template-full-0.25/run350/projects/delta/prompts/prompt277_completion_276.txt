  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.peekLength()` returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, while `iter.peek()` returns the next operation itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.next()` advances the iterator to the next operation and returns that operation, while `iter.peek()` only returns the next operation without advancing the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.peek() + 1` returns the length of the next operation plus one, while `iter.peekLength()` returns the length of the next operation.

DONE.
