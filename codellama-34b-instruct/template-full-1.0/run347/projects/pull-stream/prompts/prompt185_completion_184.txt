  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` variable is not defined in the code, so it would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would always evaluate to `false`, causing the `cb(null, array[i++])` line to be skipped.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed to the `cb` function, which is not the intended behavior of the code.

DONE.
