  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [id]: getTimezone(id) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `getCountry(id, options)` to retrieve the country object, while this new code fragment uses `getTimezone(id)` to retrieve the timezone object. This would cause the `getAllCountries` function to return a different set of objects, which may or may not be a desired outcome.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [id]: getCountry(id) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `getCountry(id, options)` to retrieve the country object, while this new code fragment uses `getCountry(id)` to retrieve the country object without the `options` argument. This would cause the `getAllCountries` function to return a different set of objects, which may or may not be a desired outcome.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [id]: get
