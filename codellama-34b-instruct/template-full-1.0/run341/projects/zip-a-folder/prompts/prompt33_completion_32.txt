  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function would be called instead of `reject`, which would cause the promise to resolve even if the error occurs, which would lead to unexpected behavior in the application.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.error
```
This would result in different behavior because the `console.error` function would be called instead of `reject`, which would log the error to the console instead of propagating it to the code that called `zipAFolder.compress()`, which would result in the application continuing to run even if there was an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 throw new Error('zipAFolder.compress() error')
```
This would result in different behavior because a new error would be thrown instead of propagating the original error, which would cause the application to crash and provide a different error message.

DONE.
