  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method would be called with `null` as the `this` value, rather than the original `thisp` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method would be called with `undefined` as the `this` value, rather than the original `thisp` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method would be called with an empty object as the `this` value, rather than the original `thisp` value.

DONE.
