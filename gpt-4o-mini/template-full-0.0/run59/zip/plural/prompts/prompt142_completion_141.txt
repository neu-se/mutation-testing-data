Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type(rule[0]) === 'String' && rule[0] !== word
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly return a match when the rule string does not equal the word, leading to unexpected results in pluralization.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type(rule[0]) === 'String' && rule[0].includes(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any rule string that contains the word as a substring, rather than requiring an exact match, which could lead to incorrect plural forms being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type(rule[0]) === 'String' && rule[0].startsWith(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any rule string that starts with the word, which could cause incorrect pluralization for words that do not fully match the rule.

DONE.
