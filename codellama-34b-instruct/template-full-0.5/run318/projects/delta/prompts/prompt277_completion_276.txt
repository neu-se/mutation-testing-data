  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.peek` returns the next element in the iterator without advancing it, while `iter.next()` advances the iterator and returns the next element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.peek()` returns the next element in the iterator without advancing it, while `iter.next()` advances the iterator and returns the next element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.peek(1)` returns the next element in the iterator without advancing it, while `iter.next()` advances the iterator and returns the next element.

DONE.
