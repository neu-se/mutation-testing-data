  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function would be called with `null` instead of the original `exception`, which could cause the program to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function would be called with `undefined` instead of the original `exception`, which could cause the program to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("Different error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function would be called with a different error message, which could cause the program to behave differently.

DONE.
