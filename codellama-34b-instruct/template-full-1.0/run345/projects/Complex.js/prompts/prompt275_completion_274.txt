  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function returns the cosine of a given angle, while the `sin` function returns its sine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tan` function returns the tangent of a given angle, while the `sin` function returns its sine.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
Math.atan
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan` function returns the arctangent of a given angle, while the `sin` function returns its sine.

DONE.
