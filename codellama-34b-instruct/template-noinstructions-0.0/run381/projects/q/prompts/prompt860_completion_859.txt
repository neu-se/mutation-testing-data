  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Q can't apply finally callback");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws an error if the `callback` is not a function, while this replacement would throw an error regardless of the type of `callback`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws an error if the `callback` is not a function, while this replacement would return a rejected promise with the `reason` as the rejection reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.resolve(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws an error if the `callback` is not a function, while this replacement would return a resolved promise with the `reason` as the resolution value.

DONE.
