  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator will negate the value of `resolvedPromise`, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if `resolvedPromise` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, which means that the `if` statement would only evaluate to `true` if `resolvedPromise` is strictly equal to `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, which means that the `if` statement would only evaluate to `true` if `resolvedPromise` is strictly unequal to `undefined`.

DONE.
