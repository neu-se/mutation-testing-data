Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field, false
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the second argument from `true` to `false`, which may alter the logic of how duplicates are handled by the `unique` function, potentially allowing non-unique items to pass through.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field, null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of `true` may lead to unexpected results in the `unique` function, as it may not handle `null` as a valid boolean value, affecting the filtering of items.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field + 'extra'
```
This would result in different behavior because concatenating a string (`'extra'`) to `field` changes the input being passed to the `unique` function, which could lead to different results in terms of uniqueness, as it modifies the original data being processed.

DONE.
