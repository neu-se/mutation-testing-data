  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This change will cause the `map` function to return `null` instead of the original `data` object, which may cause errors in the code that relies on the returned data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This change will cause the `map` function to return `undefined` instead of the original `data` object, which may cause errors in the code that relies on the returned data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This change will cause the `map` function to return an empty object instead of the original `data` object, which may cause errors in the code that relies on the returned data.

DONE.
