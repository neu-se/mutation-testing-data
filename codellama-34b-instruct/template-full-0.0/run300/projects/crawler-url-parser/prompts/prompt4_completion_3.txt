  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr || _has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is used instead of `&&`, which would cause the function to return `null` if `currentUrlStr` is falsy, even if it doesn't contain any illegal characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr && !_has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is used to negate the result of `_has_illegal_chars()`, which would cause the function to return `null` if `currentUrlStr` contains any illegal characters, even if it's truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr && _has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr) && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` constant is added to the end of the
