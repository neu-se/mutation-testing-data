  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the string 'foo' to the key, which would cause the set method to store the value under a different key than the one specified by the user.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the key to uppercase, which would cause the set method to store the value under a different key than the one specified by the user.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the key, which would cause the set method to store the value under a different key than the one specified by the user.

DONE.
