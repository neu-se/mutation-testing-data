  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return null, even if the promise is fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0, even if the promise is fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"PLACEHOLDER"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the string "PLACEHOLDER", even if the promise is fulfilled.

DONE.
