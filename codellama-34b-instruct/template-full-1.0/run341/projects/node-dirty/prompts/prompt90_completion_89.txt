  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('custom_event', 'Custom message')
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'custom_event' event would be emitted with the message 'Custom message'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('Custom error message'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'error' event would be emitted with the message 'Custom error message'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('close')
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'close' event would be emitted, indicating that the stream is shutting down.

DONE.
