  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr, false, false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would not be called with the `true` and `true` arguments, which would cause the method to not parse the URL correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr, true, false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would be called with the `true` and `false` arguments, which would cause the method to not parse the URL correctly.
