  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"deferred"
```
This would result in different behavior because "deferred" is not a valid promise state, whereas "promise" is a valid state that represents a promise that has not yet been settled. Using "deferred" would cause the promise-related code to throw an error, which would be a different behavior than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because "pending" is a valid promise state that represents a promise that has been settled but has not yet been resolved or rejected. Using "pending" would cause the promise-related code to behave differently than the original code, which assumes that the promise is still pending.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"resolved"
```
This would result in different behavior because "resolved" is a valid promise state that represents a promise that has been settled and resolved. Using "resolved" would cause the promise-related code to behave differently
