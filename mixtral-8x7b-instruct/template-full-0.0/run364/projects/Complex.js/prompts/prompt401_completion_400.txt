 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res['im'] >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check for non-positive imaginary part instead of non-positive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res['re'] <= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the real part of the result instead of the imaginary part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(res['im']) <= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the absolute value of the imaginary part is less than or equal to 0, which is never true for non-zero numbers.

DONE.
