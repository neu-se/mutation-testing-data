Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the operation from peeking at the next operation to peeking at the next operation and returning it, which could lead to incorrect handling of the operation if it is not an 'insert'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `iter` iterator instead of `otherIter`, which means it would incorrectly process the current operation from the wrong iterator, potentially leading to incorrect line handling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to peek at the current operation without advancing the iterator, which could lead to an infinite loop if the current operation is not an 'insert' or if the iterator is not properly advanced afterward.

DONE.
