Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'zip'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the archiver to use the 'zip' format regardless of the intended format passed to the `compress` method, potentially leading to incorrect file creation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` would cause the archiver to default to a different format, which may not be compatible with the intended compression type, leading to unexpected results or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'json'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to use a non-existent format 'json', which would likely cause the archiver to throw an error, as it does not support JSON as a valid archive format.

DONE.
