Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'utf16'
```
This would result in different behavior because using 'utf16' would change the encoding of the buffer to UTF-16, which may lead to incorrect string representation when the content is parsed, potentially causing issues in subsequent processing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'base64'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'base64' is not a valid encoding for converting a buffer to a string in this context, which would result in an unexpected output or an error when trying to process the content.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'utf8mb4'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'utf8mb4' is a character encoding that supports a wider range of characters than 'utf8', which could lead to discrepancies in how certain characters are represented, potentially affecting the integrity of the data being processed.

DONE.
