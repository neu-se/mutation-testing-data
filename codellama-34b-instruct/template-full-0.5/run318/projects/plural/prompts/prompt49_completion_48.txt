  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[^aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) })
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a word with one less letter than the original word, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[^aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) })
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a word with two less letters than the original word, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[^aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 3) })
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a word with three less letters than the original word,
