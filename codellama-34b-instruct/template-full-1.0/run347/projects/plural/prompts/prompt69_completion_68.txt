  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memo', () => 'memors'
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument is now a function that returns a string with a typo instead of the original string `'memos'`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'hello', 'hella'
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument is now the string `'hello'` instead of `'memo'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'M', 'm'
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument is now the single character `'M'` instead of `'memo'`.

DONE.
