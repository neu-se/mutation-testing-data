  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
++index > length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, potentially causing an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
++index <= length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one less time, potentially causing an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
++index == length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one less time, potentially causing an error.

DONE.
