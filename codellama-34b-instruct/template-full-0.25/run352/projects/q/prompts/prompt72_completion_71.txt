  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush()
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush()` is a function that is not defined in the code snippet provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` is a function that schedules a function to be executed after a certain period of time, whereas `flush()` is a function that is executed immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setImmediate(flush)
```
This would result in different behavior because `setImmediate` is a function that schedules a function to be executed as soon as possible, whereas `setTimeout` schedules a function to be executed after a certain period of time.

DONE.
