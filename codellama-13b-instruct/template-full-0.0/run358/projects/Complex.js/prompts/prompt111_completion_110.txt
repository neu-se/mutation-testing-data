  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite` function returns `true` if the argument is a finite number, and `false` otherwise. In the original code, `isFinite` is used to check if the argument is a finite number, but in this case, it would return `false` if the argument is a finite number, which would result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` function returns `true` if the argument is `NaN`, and `false` otherwise. In the original code, `isNaN` is used to check if the argument is `NaN`, but in this case, it would return `true` if the argument is `NaN`, which would result in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite(a) && isFinite(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `
