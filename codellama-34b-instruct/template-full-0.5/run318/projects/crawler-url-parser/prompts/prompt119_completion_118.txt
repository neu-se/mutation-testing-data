  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseUrl.protocol` is a different value than `baseUrl`, and would affect the outcome of the `gettype` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseUrl.host` is a different value than `baseUrl`, and would affect the outcome of the `gettype` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseUrl.path` is a different value than `baseUrl`, and would affect the outcome of the `gettype` function.

DONE.
