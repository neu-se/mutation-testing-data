  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/b/, 'e'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and would match a different set of words.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/a/, 'f'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is different, and would produce a different output for words that match the regular expression pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/a/, 'e'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is the same, but the replacement string is different, and would produce a different output for words that match the regular expression pattern.

DONE.
