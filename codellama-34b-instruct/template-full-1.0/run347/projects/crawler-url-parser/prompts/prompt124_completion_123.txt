  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the code fragment returns a function that takes no arguments and returns undefined, whereas the original code fragment returns a function that takes an argument `x` and returns its square.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a => a*a
```
This would result in different behavior because the code fragment returns a function that squares its argument, whereas the original code fragment returns a function that takes an argument `x` and returns its cube.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(x, y) => x*y
```
This would result in different behavior because the code fragment returns a function that multiplies its two arguments, whereas the original code fragment returns a function that takes two arguments `x` and `y` and returns their product plus `x`.

DONE.
