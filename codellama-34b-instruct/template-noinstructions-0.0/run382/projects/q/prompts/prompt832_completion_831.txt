  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolved
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function would not be called, and the promise would be resolved instead of rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("rejected")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function would not be called, and an error would be thrown instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function would not be called, and the promise would be resolved with an undefined value instead of rejected.

DONE.
