  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `noop` does not have any effect on the promise, while the replacement code fragment `deferred.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
my_function('arg')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `noop` does not have any effect on the promise, while the replacement code fragment `my_function('arg')` would cause the promise to be resolved with the value returned by the function `my_function('arg')`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `noop` does not have any effect on the promise, while the replacement code fragment `Q.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected with the value returned by `Q.reject`.

DONE.
