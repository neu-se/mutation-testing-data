  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror(e, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the error to be handled as a rejection, rather than as an exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror(e, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the error to be handled as an exception, rather than as a rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror(e, !Q.onerror)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would toggle the error handling behavior based on whether the `Q.onerror` function is defined or not.

DONE.
