  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.has(currentUrl.url) && urlMap.get(currentUrl.url).text.includes(text)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only add the URL to the map if it already exists and the text is not already included in the map's text property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.has(currentUrl.url) && urlMap.get(currentUrl.url).text.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only add the URL to the map if it already exists and the text property is not empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.has(currentUrl.url) && urlMap.get(currentUrl.url).text.includes(text)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only add the URL to the map if it already exists and the text is not already included in the map's text property.
