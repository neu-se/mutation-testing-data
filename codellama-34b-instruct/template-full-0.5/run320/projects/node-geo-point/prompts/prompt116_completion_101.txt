  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.calculateDestination(distance, bearing + 180)
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing is now offset by 180 degrees, which would cause the destination point to be calculated incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.calculateDestination(distance * 2, bearing)
```
This would result in different behavior because the distance is now doubled, which would cause the destination point to be calculated incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.calculateDestination(distance, bearing - 360)
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing is now offset by 360 degrees, which would cause the destination point to be calculated incorrectly.

DONE.
