  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length < 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked if the `arguments` object had more than 2 elements, while the replacement code fragment checks if it has less than 2 elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length != 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked if the `arguments` object had more than 2 elements, while the replacement code fragment checks if it has exactly 2 elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length == 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked if the `arguments` object had more than 2 elements, while the replacement code fragment checks if it has exactly 2 elements.

DONE.
