  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
`error`
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an `error` event instead of a `read_close` event, which could cause the program to behave differently when an error occurs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
`close`
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a `close` event instead of a `read_close` event, which could cause the program to behave differently when the read stream is closed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
`drain`
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a `drain` event instead of a `read_close` event, which could cause the program to behave differently when the read stream is drained.

DONE.
