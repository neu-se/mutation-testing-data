  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.hasOwnProperty(index)
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasOwnProperty` checks if the property is an own property of the object, whereas `index in this` checks if the property is present in the object, including its prototype chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.prototype.hasOwnProperty(index)
```
This would result in different behavior because `prototype.hasOwnProperty()` checks if the property is in the object's prototype chain, whereas `index in this` checks if the property is present in the object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(this, index)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call()` to check if the property is an own property of the object, which is different from using `index in this`.

DONE.
