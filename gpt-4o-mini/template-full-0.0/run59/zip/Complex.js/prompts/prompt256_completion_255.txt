Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compute the cosine of `b` instead of the sine, leading to incorrect results in the imaginary part of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(b + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compute the sine of `b + 1`, which alters the input to the sine function, thus producing a different output than the original `Math.sin(b)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(b) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the result of the sine function, which would not match the expected output and could lead to incorrect calculations in the complex exponentiation.

DONE.
