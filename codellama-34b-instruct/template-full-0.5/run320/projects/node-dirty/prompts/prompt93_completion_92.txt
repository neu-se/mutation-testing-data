  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error('This is a different error message')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, which could cause the test suite to fail if it is not expecting this specific error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error('Empty lines never appear in a healthy database')
```
This would result in the same behavior as the original code fragment, as the error message is the same.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error('This is a different error message')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, which could cause the test suite to fail if it is not expecting this specific error message.

DONE.
