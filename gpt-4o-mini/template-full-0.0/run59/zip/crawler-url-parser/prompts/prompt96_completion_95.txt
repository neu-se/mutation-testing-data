Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href + baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because it concatenates the `href` and `baseUrlStr` strings, which would lead to an invalid URL being parsed instead of using them as separate parameters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it strips out all non-alphanumeric characters from the `href`, potentially resulting in a malformed URL that cannot be parsed correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr || href
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a logical OR to prioritize `baseUrlStr` over `href`, which could lead to incorrect URL parsing if `baseUrlStr` is falsy (e.g., `null` or `undefined`), thus ignoring the actual `href`.

DONE.
