  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (baseUrlStr && _has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checks for illegal characters in the current URL, while this code fragment would also check for illegal characters in the base URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (baseUrlStr && !_has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for illegal characters in the base URL, while this code fragment would only check for legal characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (baseUrlStr && _has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr) && _has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checks for illegal characters in the current URL, while this code fragment would also check for illegal characters in the base URL and current URL.

DONE.
