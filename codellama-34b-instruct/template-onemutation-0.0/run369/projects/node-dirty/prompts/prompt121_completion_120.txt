  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', this._inFlightWrites);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits the 'drain' event with no arguments, while the modified code emits the 'drain' event with the number of in-flight writes as an argument. This could cause the event handler to behave differently, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the program.

DONE.
