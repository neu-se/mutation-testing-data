Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the order of the callbacks, causing the rejected callback to be executed with the fulfilled value and vice versa, leading to incorrect handling of promise resolutions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled.bind(null, "unexpected"), rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the fulfilled callback to always receive the string "unexpected" as its first argument, regardless of the actual value, which could lead to incorrect processing of the resolved value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, function() { throw new Error("Forced rejection"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the rejected callback to always throw a new error, causing the promise to always reject regardless of the actual outcome of the promise, thus bypassing the original rejection handling.

DONE.
