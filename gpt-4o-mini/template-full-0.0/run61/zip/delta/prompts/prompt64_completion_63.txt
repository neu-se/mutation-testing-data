Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly adds the new operation to the end of the `ops` array without merging it with the last operation, potentially leading to a longer `ops` array and incorrect operation sequences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.unshift(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the new operation to the beginning of the `ops` array instead of merging it with the last operation, which would disrupt the intended order of operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would terminate the method early without adding the new operation to the `ops` array, effectively ignoring the insert operation altogether.

DONE.
