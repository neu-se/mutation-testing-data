  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(key, val)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would stringify the `key` and `val` variables separately, rather than as a single object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(this._data.get(key))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would stringify the value associated with the `key` in the `this._data` object, rather than the `key` and `val` variables.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would stringify the `key` variable only, rather than the `key` and `val` variables as a single object.

DONE.
