  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
`
function_defineProperty
`
This would result in different behavior because `function_defineProperty` is not a defined function, so it would throw a ReferenceError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
`
object_defineProperty(undefined, "__minimumStackCounter__", {value: p.stackCounter, configurable: true});
`
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` as the first parameter to `defineProperty` would not define the property on any object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
`
object_defineProperty(error, "__minimumStackCounter__", {value: p.nonExistentProperty, configurable: true});
`
This would result in different behavior because trying to access a non-existent property would result in an error.

DONE.
