  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.retain === 'number' &&
          typeof lastOp.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator would return `'string'` for a string value, which would make the condition evaluate to `false` even if `lastOp.retain` is a string with a non-zero length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.retain === 'number' &&
          typeof lastOp.retain === 'boolean'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator would return `'boolean'` for a boolean value, which would make the condition evaluate to `false` even if `lastOp.retain` is a boolean with a non-zero value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.retain === 'number' &&
          typeof lastOp.retain === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof`
