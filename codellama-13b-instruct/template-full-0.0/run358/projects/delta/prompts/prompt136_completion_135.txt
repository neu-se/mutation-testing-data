  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[index - 1] = { insert: lastOp.insert + newOp.insert };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `insert` operation to be applied to the previous operation, rather than the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[index - 1] = { retain: lastOp.retain + newOp.retain };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `retain` operation to be applied to the previous operation, rather than the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[index - 1] = { delete: lastOp.delete + newOp.delete };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `delete` operation to be applied to the previous operation, rather than the current operation.

DONE.
