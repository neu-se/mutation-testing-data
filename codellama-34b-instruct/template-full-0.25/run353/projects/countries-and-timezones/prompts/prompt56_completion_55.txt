  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones, options.deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deprecated` property is not being considered in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones, options.deprecated ? options.deprecated : options
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deprecated` property is being checked, but the result is not being used to determine the value of the `options` parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones, options.deprecated ? options : options.deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deprecated` property is being checked, but the result is not being used to determine the value of the `options` parameter.

DONE.
