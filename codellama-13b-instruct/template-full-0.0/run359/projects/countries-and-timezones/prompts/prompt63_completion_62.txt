  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.countries[id]
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the `countries` property of the `data` object directly, rather than using the `getCountry` function. This could cause issues if the `getCountry` function is not properly testing the edge cases of the `data` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.countries[id].timezones[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the `timezones` property of the `data` object directly, rather than using the `getTimezone
