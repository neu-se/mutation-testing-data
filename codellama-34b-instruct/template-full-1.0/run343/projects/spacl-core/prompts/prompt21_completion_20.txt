  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any character instead of just the forward slash, which could lead to unintended matches and errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(/\*:\])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any character except for forward slash, forward slash, ":" and "]", which could lead to unintended matches and errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(/\*:%])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any character except for forward slash, forward slash, ":" and "%]", which could lead to unintended matches and errors.

DONE.
