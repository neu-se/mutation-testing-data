  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the + operator is left associative, meaning that the expression "1 + 2" would first add 1 to 2, resulting in 3, and then pass that result to the dispatch function, which is not the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the * operator is left associative, meaning that the expression "2 * 1" would first multiply 1 by 2, resulting in 2, and then pass that result to the dispatch function, which is not the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true && 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the && operator is left associative, meaning that the expression "true && 1" would first evaluate to "true", and then pass that result to the dispatch function, which is not the desired behavior.

DONE.
