  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{...options, deprecated: !deprecated}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the value of the `deprecated` option, causing the `deliverCountry` function to behave differently when called with a deprecated country.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{...options, allTimezones: country.timezones}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the `country.timezones` property to the `allTimezones` property of the `options` object, causing the `deliverCountry` function to behave differently when called with a country that has timezones.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{...options, timezones: country.allTimezones}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the `country.allTimezones` property to the `timezones` property of the `options` object, causing the `deliverCountry` function to behave
