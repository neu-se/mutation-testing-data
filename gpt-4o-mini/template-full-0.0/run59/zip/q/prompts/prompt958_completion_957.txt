Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls `Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs)` instead of using the `bound` function, which means the `thisp` context is not applied to the `callback`, potentially leading to incorrect behavior if the `callback` relies on its `this` context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(null, nodeArgs)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the `callback` with `null` as the `this` context instead of the specified `thisp`, which may cause the `callback` to behave incorrectly if it expects a specific context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call(thisp, nodeArgs)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `call` instead of `apply`, which would result in an error since `nodeArgs` is an array and `call` expects individual arguments rather than an array, leading to a runtime error.

DONE.
