  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the entire array is passed as arguments to the `fulfilled` callback, while in the modified code, only the first element of the array is passed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `array` is passed as arguments to the `fulfilled` callback, while in the modified code, `null` is passed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `array` is passed as arguments to the `fulfilled` callback, while in the modified code, an empty array is passed.

DONE.
