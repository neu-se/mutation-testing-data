  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).delay
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.delay` returns a promise that is resolved with the value of the original promise after the specified delay, whereas `Q.timeout` returns a promise that is rejected with an error if the original promise is not resolved within the specified timeout.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.then` returns a promise that is resolved with the value of the original promise, whereas `Q.timeout` returns a promise that is rejected with an error if the original promise is not resolved within the specified timeout.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` returns a promise that is rejected with the specified error, whereas `Q.timeout` returns a promise that is rejected with an error if the original promise is not resolved within the specified timeout.

DONE.
