 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch` block would not receive the `rejected` value as an argument, but instead a resolved promise. This is because `then` returns a new promise that is resolved with the result of the callback, and `Promise.resolve()` creates a new promise that is immediately resolved with no value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Error('An error occurred')
