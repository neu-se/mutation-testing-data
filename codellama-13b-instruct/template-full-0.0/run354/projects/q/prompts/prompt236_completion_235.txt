  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise, args
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolvedPromise` variable is not defined in the current scope, and the `args` variable is not used in the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise, args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args[0]` variable is used instead of the `args` variable, which could cause the function to behave differently if the `args` variable is not defined or has a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise, args[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args[1]` variable is used instead of the `args` variable, which could cause the function to behave differently if the `args` variable is not defined or has a different value.

DONE.
