  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `terminate(cb)` calls the `terminate` function with the `cb` argument, which is a callback function that is called when the `read` function is finished. Replacing it with `cb(null, data)` would cause the `cb` function to be called with `null` as the first argument and `data` as the second argument, which would likely cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(ended, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `terminate(cb)` calls the `terminate` function with the `cb` argument, which is a callback function that is called when the `read` function is finished. Replacing it with `cb(ended, data)` would cause the `cb` function to be called with `ended` as the first argument and `data` as the second argument, which would likely cause the test to fail.
