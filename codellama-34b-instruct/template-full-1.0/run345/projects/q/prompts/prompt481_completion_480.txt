  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `at` method would be called with the index `-1`, which would return `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections[at + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `at` method would be called with the index `at + 1`, which would return `undefined` if the index is out of bounds.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons[at - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `at` method would be called with the index `at - 1`, which would return `undefined` if the index is out of bounds.

DONE.
