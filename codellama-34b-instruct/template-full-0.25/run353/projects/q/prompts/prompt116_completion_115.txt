  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the index variable to access the current element in the array, while the modified code fragment uses the index variable plus one to access the next element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the index variable to access the current element in the array, while the modified code fragment uses the index variable minus one to access the previous element in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the index variable to access the current element in the array, while the modified code fragment uses the index variable multiplied by two to access the element at twice the index in the array.

DONE.
