  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, null, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for `undefined` while the new code fragment checks for `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, 0, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for `undefined` while the new code fragment checks for `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, 'null', cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for `undefined` while the new code fragment checks for the string `'null'`.

DONE.
