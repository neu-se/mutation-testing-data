  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `encoding` property of the `options` object as the second argument to `fs.readFile()`, instead of passing the `options` object directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, options.encoding, options.flag
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `encoding` and `flag` properties of the `options` object as the second and third arguments to `fs.readFile()`, instead of passing the `options` object directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, options.encoding, options.flag, options.mode
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `encoding`, `flag`, and `mode` properties of the `options` object as the second, third, and fourth arguments to `fs.readFile()`, instead of passing the `options` object directly.

DONE.
