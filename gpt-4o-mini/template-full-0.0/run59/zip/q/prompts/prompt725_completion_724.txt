Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.state
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses a property that may not exist on the promise object, leading to potential `undefined` values instead of the expected state information.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls a method that returns the primitive value of the promise object, which may not provide the same information as the `inspect` method, potentially causing incorrect handling of the promise's state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then
```
This would result in different behavior because it references the `then` method of the promise instead of inspecting its state, which could lead to incorrect assumptions about the promise's fulfillment or rejection status.

DONE.
