  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a new string, whereas `toString()` returns the string representation of the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `substr()` returns a new string starting from the specified index, whereas `toString()` returns the string representation of the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring()` returns a new string starting from the specified index, whereas `toString()` returns the string representation of the object.

DONE.
