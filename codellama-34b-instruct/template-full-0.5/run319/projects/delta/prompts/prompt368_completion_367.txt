  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekType` is a method that returns the type of the next operation, while `peekType` without parentheses returns the function itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength` returns the length of the next operation, while `peekType` returns the type of the next operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekOp()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekOp` returns the next operation, while `peekType` returns the type of the next operation.

DONE.
