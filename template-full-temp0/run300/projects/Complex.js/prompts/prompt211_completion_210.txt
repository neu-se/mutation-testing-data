  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a, b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.atan2` function, which takes two arguments and returns the arctangent of the quotient of the two arguments. In contrast, the replacement code fragment uses the `Math.atan` function, which takes a single argument and returns the arctangent of that argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b, a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.atan2` function, which takes two arguments and returns the arctangent of the quotient of the two arguments. In contrast, the replacement code fragment uses the `Math.atan` function, which takes a single argument and returns the arctangent of that argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b, a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.atan2` function, which takes
