  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` expects a function as its argument, and `null` is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` expects a function as its argument, and `"hello"` is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function is supposed to return a value, but `value + 1` is not a value.

DONE.
