  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan2` function would have a different input, resulting in a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2*b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan2` function would have a different input, resulting in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b+1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan2` function would have a different input, resulting in a different output.

DONE.
