  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>(spec) {
  return { regex: spec, props: [] };
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compile` function is no longer being called, and the `spec` argument is not being used to generate the regular expression and property list.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>(spec) {
  const { regex, props } = compile(spec.replace(/\/+/, '/'));
  return { regex, props };
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spec` argument is being modified to remove any consecutive forward slashes before being passed to the `compile` function. This could result in a different regular expression being generated, depending on the specific `spec` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>(spec) {
  const { regex, props } = compile(spec);
  return { regex: regex.
