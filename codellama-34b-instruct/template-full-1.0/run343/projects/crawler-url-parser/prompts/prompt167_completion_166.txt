  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.includes(pageurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the two variables being compared, making the test check whether the longer path contains the shorter path instead of the other way around.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!pageurl_path.includes(linkurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the result of the original code fragment, making the test check whether the shorter path does not contain the longer path instead of whether the longer path contains the shorter path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.startsWith(linkurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check whether the shorter path starts with the longer path instead of whether the longer path contains the shorter path.

DONE.
