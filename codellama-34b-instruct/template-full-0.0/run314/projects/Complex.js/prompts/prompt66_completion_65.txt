  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg']
```
This would result in different behavior because `arg` is a different property of the `a` object than `phi`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b['phi']
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` is a different variable than `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['phi'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would change the value of the expression.

DONE.
