  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.value` is not a promise, so it would not be treated as such in the `when` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(result.value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(result.value)` is a promise that is already resolved, so it would not be treated as a pending promise in the `when` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(result).value
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(result)` is a promise that is already resolved, so it would not be treated as a pending promise in the `when` function, and `result.value` would be `undefined`.

DONE.
