  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.getPrototypeOf(object).inspect
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `inspect` property of the object's prototype, rather than the object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(object, "inspect").value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the `inspect` property descriptor, rather than the property itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.inspect
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `inspect` property of the `Object.prototype` object, rather than the object itself.

DONE.
