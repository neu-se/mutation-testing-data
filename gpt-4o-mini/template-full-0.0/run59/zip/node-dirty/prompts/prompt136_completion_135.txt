Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{key, val: null}
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the value to `null` for every key, which would overwrite any existing values in `_data` with `null`, potentially leading to data loss.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{key: this._data.get(key), val: this._data.get(key) + 1}
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to increment the value retrieved from `_data`, which could lead to unexpected results if the value is not a number or if it doesn't exist, potentially causing errors or incorrect data being written.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{key: this._data.get(key), val: this._data.has(key) ? this._data.get(key) : 'default'}
```
This would result in different behavior because it assigns a default string value if the key does not exist in `_data`, which could lead to the introduction of unexpected string values instead of leaving the value undefined or deleting the key.

DONE.
