  I have replaced the PLACEHOLDER in the code snippet with three different fragments of code, each of which has different behavior than the original code fragment.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return line.split("\n")[0];
```
This would result in different behavior because it only returns the first line of the stack trace, rather than the entire stack trace as the original code does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return line.replace("\n", " ");
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces all newlines (\n) with spaces, rather than returning the stack trace as a list of lines as the original code does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return line.split("\n")[0].replace("(module.js:", "").trim();
```
This would result in different behavior because it only returns the first line of the stack trace, removes the "(module.js:" prefix from the beginning of the line, and trims any whitespace from the beginning
