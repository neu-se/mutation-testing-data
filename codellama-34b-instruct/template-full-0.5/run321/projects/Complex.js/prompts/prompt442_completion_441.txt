  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.pow` and `Math.sqrt` have different mathematical properties. `Math.pow` raises a number to a power, while `Math.sqrt` returns the square root of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number, which is different from the behavior of `Math.pow` and `Math.sqrt`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given number, which is different from the behavior of `Math.pow` and `Math.sqrt`.

DONE.
