  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a different method than `apply`, and it would change the `this` context of the function being called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with the `this` context set to the first argument, whereas `apply` and `call` modify the `this` context of the existing function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not the same as `resolvedPromise`, and it would change the `this` context of the function being called.

DONE.
