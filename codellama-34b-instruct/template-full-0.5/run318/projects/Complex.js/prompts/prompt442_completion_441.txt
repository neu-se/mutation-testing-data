  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` returns the square root of a number, whereas `Math.pow` returns the value of a number raised to a power.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.re
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.re` refers to the real part of the complex number, whereas `Math.pow` is a function that takes two arguments and returns the first argument raised to the power of the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex.EPSILON
```
This would result in different behavior because `Complex.EPSILON` is a constant that represents a small value used for comparing real numbers, whereas `Math.pow` is a function that takes two arguments and returns the first argument raised to the power of the second argument.

DONE.
