  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isFulfilled` function to return `true` for rejected promises, which would be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isFulfilled` function to return `false` for pending promises, which would be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state === "fulfilled" || object.inspect().state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isFulfilled` function to return `true` for both fulfilled and rejected promises, which would be incorrect.

DONE.
