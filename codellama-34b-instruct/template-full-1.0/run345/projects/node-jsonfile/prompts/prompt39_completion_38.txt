  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFileSync` returns the number of bytes written to the file, while `fs.writeFile` does not return anything.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.write
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.write` is a different method from `fs.writeFile` and has different arguments and return values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeSync` is a different method from `fs.writeFileSync` and has different arguments and return values.

DONE.
