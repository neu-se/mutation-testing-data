  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', () => this.close()
```
This would result in different behavior because the event that causes the callback to be invoked would be 'error' instead of 'drain'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'failure', () => this.close()
```
This would result in different behavior because the event that causes the callback to be invoked would be 'failure' instead of 'drain'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain', () => this.close(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would be invoked with 'true' instead of 'false'.

DONE.
