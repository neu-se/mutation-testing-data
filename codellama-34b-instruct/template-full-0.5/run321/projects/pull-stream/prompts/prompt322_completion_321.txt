  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
This would result in different behavior because `a && onEnd` will only be true if both `a` and `onEnd` are truthy, whereas `a || !onEnd` will be true if either `a` or `!onEnd` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!a && onEnd
```
This would result in different behavior because `!a && onEnd` will only be true if both `!a` and `onEnd` are truthy, whereas `a || !onEnd` will be true if either `a` or `!onEnd` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
