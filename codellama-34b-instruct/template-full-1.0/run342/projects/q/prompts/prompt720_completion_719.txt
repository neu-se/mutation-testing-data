  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code would create a new function, which is not present in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var deferred = Q.defer();
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code would create a new deferred object, which is not present in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function resolve() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code would create a new function, which is not present in the original code.

DONE.
