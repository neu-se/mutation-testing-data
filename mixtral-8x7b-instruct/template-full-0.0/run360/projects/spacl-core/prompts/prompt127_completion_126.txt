 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const index = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it declares a new constant variable instead of using the existing let variable, making it impossible to modify the value of index in the for loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the index to 1, skipping the first element in the for loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.regex.props.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the length of the props array as the index, which would cause an out-of-bounds error since the index should be less than the length.

DONE.
