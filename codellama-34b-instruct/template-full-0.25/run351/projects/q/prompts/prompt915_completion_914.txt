  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new deferred object, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because it would refer to the existing deferred object, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an undefined value to the makeNodeResolver method, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

DONE.
