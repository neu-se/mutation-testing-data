  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basename.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would uppercase the `basename` instead of leaving it as is, which could cause the `decodeURIComponent` function to produce a different output and potentially break the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `path.basename` function on the `dest` property of the `options` object, instead of the `pathname` property of the `URL` object, which could cause the resulting filename to be different and potentially break the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.split('/').slice(-1)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a different approach to extract the filename from the `dest` property of the `options` object, which could cause the resulting filename to be different and potentially break the code.
