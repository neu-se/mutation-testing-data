  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [country]: { current: [id], all: [] } }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `current` property would always contain the `id` of the current timezone, instead of an empty array as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [country]: { current: [], all: [id] } }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` property would always contain the `id` of the current timezone, instead of an empty array as in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [country]: { current: [id], all: [id] } }
```
This would result in different behavior because both the `current` and `all` properties would contain the `id` of the current timezone, instead of an empty array as in the original code.

DONE.
