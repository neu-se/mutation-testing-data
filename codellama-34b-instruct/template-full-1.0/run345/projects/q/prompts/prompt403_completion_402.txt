  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).thenThrow
```
This would result in different behavior because `.thenThrow` is not a method in the `Q` promise library, and would cause a `TypeError` if called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).thenReturn
```
This would result in different behavior because `.thenReturn` is not a method in the `Q` promise library, and would cause a `TypeError` if called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `.then` without a callback would not cause a `TypeError`, but it would not fulfill the promise with the expected value.

DONE.
