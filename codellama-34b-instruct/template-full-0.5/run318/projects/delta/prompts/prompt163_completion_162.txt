  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherIter.next(<PLACEHOLDER>));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the next operation from the other iterator to the delta, even if the current operation in the this iterator is not a retain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(thisIter.next(<PLACEHOLDER>));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the next operation from the this iterator to the delta, even if the current operation in the other iterator is not a retain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherIter.next(<PLACEHOLDER>));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the next operation from the other iterator to the delta, even if the current operation in the this iterator is not a retain.

DONE.
