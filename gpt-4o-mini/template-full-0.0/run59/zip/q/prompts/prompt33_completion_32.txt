Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of executing the intended task function, it would pass `null`, leading to a TypeError when trying to invoke `null` as a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` would also lead to a TypeError when attempting to call `undefined` as a function, similar to the previous option.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to perform an arithmetic operation on the `task` variable, which is expected to be a function. This would lead to a TypeError if `task` is not a number, as it cannot be added to `1`.

DONE.
