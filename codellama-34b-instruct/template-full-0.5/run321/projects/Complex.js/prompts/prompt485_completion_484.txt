  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `exports` is an object, while the modified code fragment checks if it is not an object. If `exports` is not an object, the modified code fragment would execute the `else` block, while the original code fragment would execute the `if` block.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `exports` is an object, while the modified code fragment checks if it is undefined. If `exports` is undefined, the modified code fragment would execute the `else` block, while the original code fragment would execute the `if` block.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `exports` is an object, while the modified code fragment checks if it is a number. If `
