Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately resolve the promise with the `object`, bypassing any dispatch logic that might be necessary for handling asynchronous operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with the `object`, leading to an error state instead of attempting to dispatch a method on the `object`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(null, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to handle the promise resolution with a `then` method, but incorrectly pass `args` as the rejection handler, which is not the intended use of the dispatch method.

DONE.
