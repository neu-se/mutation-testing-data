  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, abort, onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` function is not being called with the correct arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, abort, onAbort(abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` function is being called with the `abort` argument, which is not the correct argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, abort, onAbort(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` function is being called with the `cb` argument, which is not the correct argument.

DONE.
