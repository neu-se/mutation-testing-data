  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(λ2 + 540) % 360 - 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `rad2deg` function to convert the longitude from radians to degrees, but the new code fragment uses a different formula that is not equivalent.
