  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment emits an `'error'` event with an error object as its argument. However, in this modified code, an `Error` object is created with the error object as its message, which would result in a different error being emitted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment emits an `'error'` event with an error object as its argument. However, in this modified code, no error object is passed, which would result in a different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment emits an `'error'` event with an error object as its argument. However, in this modified code, no error object is passed at all, which would result in a different behavior.

DONE.
