  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).slice(1, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the string representation of the object without the leading "[" and trailing "]" characters, which could cause the test suite to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).slice(2, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the string representation of the object without the leading "[" and trailing "]" characters, but it would also skip the first character of the string, which could cause the test suite to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).slice(-2, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the string representation of the object without the leading "[" and trailing "]" characters, but it would also include the last two characters of the string, which could cause the
