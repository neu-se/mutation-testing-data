  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This change will cause the `buildCountry` function to return `null` instead of the expected country object, which will likely cause the `getCountry` function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This change will cause the `buildCountry` function to return `undefined` instead of the expected country object, which will likely cause the `getCountry` function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This change will cause the `buildCountry` function to return an empty object instead of the expected country object, which will likely cause the `getCountry` function to throw an error.

DONE.
