  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-2
```
This would result in different behavior because using -2 as the slice parameter would return the characters from the beginning of the string to the second-to-last character, rather than the last character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-3
```
This would result in different behavior because using -3 as the slice parameter would return the characters from the beginning of the string to the third-to-last character, rather than the last character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-4
```
This would result in different behavior because using -4 as the slice parameter would return the characters from the beginning of the string to the fourth-to-last character, rather than the last character.

DONE.
