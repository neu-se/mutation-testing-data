  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, so the `bind` method would not be called and the `uncurryThis` function would return a function that simply calls the original `Function.call` method, which would result in a different behavior than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, so the `bind` method would not be called and the `uncurryThis` function would return a function that simply calls the original `Function.call` method, which would result in a different behavior than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` would refer to the global object, which would cause the `bind` method to be called on the global object, which would result in a different behavior than the original code.

DONE.
