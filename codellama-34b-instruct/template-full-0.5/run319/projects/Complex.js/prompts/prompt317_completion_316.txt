  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sinh` is a function that calculates the hyperbolic sine of a number, whereas `sinh` is a property of the `Complex` object that returns the hyperbolic sine of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cosh` is a function that calculates the hyperbolic cosine of a number, whereas `cosh` is a property of the `Complex` object that returns the hyperbolic cosine of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tanh
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tanh` is a function that calculates the hyperbolic tangent of a number, whereas `tanh` is a property of the `Complex` object that returns the hyperbolic tangent of the complex number
