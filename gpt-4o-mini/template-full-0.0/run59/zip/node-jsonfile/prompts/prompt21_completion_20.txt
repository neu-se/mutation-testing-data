Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file + 'extra'
```
This would result in different behavior because it concatenates the string 'extra' to the file name, potentially causing the function to attempt to read a non-existent file, leading to an error that would not occur with the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes the `options` object instead of the expected `file` string, which would cause the `fs.readFileSync` method to fail since it expects a file path as the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it transforms the file name to uppercase, which may not match the actual file name on a case-sensitive file system, leading to a potential file not found error.

DONE.
