  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).slice(8, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `slice` method to extract a substring from the string returned by `Object.prototype.toString.call(obj)`, while this modified code fragment would attempt to extract a substring from the `slice` method itself, which is not a string and does not have a `slice` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).slice(8, -1) + 'ies'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `slice` method to extract a substring from the string returned by `Object.prototype.toString.call(obj)`, while this modified code fragment would attempt to concatenate the substring with the string `'ies'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).slice(8, -1) + 'y
