  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).delay
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.delay` returns a promise for the resolution of the given promise after a certain time has elapsed, while `Q.timeout` returns a promise for the resolution of the given promise if it is fulfilled before the timeout, otherwise rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.then` returns a promise for the resolution of the given promise, while `Q.timeout` returns a promise for the resolution of the given promise if it is fulfilled before the timeout, otherwise rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).fcall
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fcall` returns a promise for the resolution of the given promise, while `Q.timeout` returns a promise for the resolution of the given promise if it is fulfilled before the timeout, otherwise rejected.

DONE.
