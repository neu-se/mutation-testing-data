  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` checks if the value is a promise-like object, which means it has a `then` method, but it may not be a true promise. In contrast, `isPromise` checks if the value is a true promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFulfilled(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFulfilled` checks if the value is a fulfilled promise, but it may not be a true promise. In contrast, `isPromise` checks if the value is a true promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isRejected(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `isRejected` checks if the value is a rejected promise, but it may not be a true promise. In contrast, `isPromise` checks if the value is a true promise.
