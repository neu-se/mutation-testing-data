  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisOp.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.retain` is always a number when `typeof otherOp.retain === 'number'`, but it may not always be a number when `typeof otherOp.retain === 'object'`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain != null
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.retain` may not always be `null` when `typeof otherOp.retain === 'object'`, but it always will be `null` when `typeof otherOp.retain === 'number'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisOp.retain === 'object' && thisOp.retain != null
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.retain` may not always be an object when `typeof otherOp.retain === 'number'`, but it always will be an object
