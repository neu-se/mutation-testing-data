 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the cosine of the complex number would be multiplied by 1 instead of the 're' property of the complex number. This would cause incorrect results when calculating the cosine of complex numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re'] * this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument of the cosine function would be squared, which would change the result of the cosine calculation. This could cause the function to return incorrect results for certain input values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument of the cosine function would be replaced with a random number, which would cause the function to return incorrect results for all input values.

DONE.
