  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `compose` method to return a delta with a different number of operations than the original delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `compose` method to return a delta with a different number of operations than the original delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `compose` method to return a delta with no operations, which would cause the `length` method to return 0.

DONE.
