Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(promise).thenResolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the way the promise is resolved, potentially leading to different timing or chaining behavior compared to the original `Q(promise).thenResolve(value)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).thenReject(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the resolution to a rejection instead of a resolution, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the provided value instead of resolving it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then(function() { return value; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it alters the promise chain by not explicitly using `thenResolve`, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the promise is not handled correctly, as it does not guarantee that the value is returned as a resolved promise.

DONE.
