  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `delta.concat(rest.slice()).chop`.
This would result in different behavior because `rest` is treated as a separate argument in the `slice()` method, but the original code does not make this distinction.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `delta.concat(rest.chop()).slice()`.
This would result in different behavior because `chop()` is called on `rest` before `slice()`, whereas the original code calls `slice()` before `chop()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `delta.concat(rest).slice()`.
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method is called on `rest` before concatenating with `delta`, whereas the original code concatenates `delta` with `rest` and then calls `slice()`.

DONE.
