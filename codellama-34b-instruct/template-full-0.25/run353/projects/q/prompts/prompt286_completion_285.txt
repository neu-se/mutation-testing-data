  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator checks if the operand is a function, while the `!==` operator checks if the operand is not equal to the given value. In this case, if `resolver` is not a function, the `!==` operator would return `true`, even if `resolver` is a function with a different name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver !== Function
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Function` constructor is a function that creates a new function, and the `!==` operator checks if the operand is not equal to the given value. In this case, if `resolver` is not a function, the `!==` operator would return `true`, even if `resolver` is a function with a different name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver.constructor !== Function
```
This would result in different behavior
