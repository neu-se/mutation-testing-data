  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is removed, which would cause the `hasNext()` method to return `true` when there are no more operations to iterate over, rather than `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.hasNext() && this.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is added, which would cause the `hasNext()` method to return `true` only when there are more operations to iterate over and the next operation is a deletion operation, rather than returning `true` when there are more operations to iterate over regardless of the type of the next operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.hasNext() && this.peekType() !== 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator is added, which would cause the `hasNext()` method to return `true`
