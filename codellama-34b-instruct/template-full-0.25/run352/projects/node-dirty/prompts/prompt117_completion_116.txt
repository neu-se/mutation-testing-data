  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('read_close', 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit the event `'read_close'` with the argument `0`, which is not the same as the original code that emits the event without any arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('read_close', this._data.size);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit the event `'read_close'` with the argument `this._data.size`, which is not the same as the original code that emits the event without any arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('read_close', this._data.size - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit the event `'read_close'` with the argument `this._data.size - 1`, which is not the same as the original code that emits the event without any arguments.

DONE.
