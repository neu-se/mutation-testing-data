 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek()` only returns the next operation without advancing the iterator, causing an infinite loop when composing operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because passing 0 as the argument to `next()` will always return an empty operation, causing unexpected behavior in the composed delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.next(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because passing -1 as the argument to `next()` will throw an error, causing the composition to fail and potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the composed delta.

DONE.
