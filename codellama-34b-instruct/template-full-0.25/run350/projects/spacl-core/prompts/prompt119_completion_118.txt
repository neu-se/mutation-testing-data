  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the path to lowercase, which could cause the `matches()` method to return `false` even if the path is a match.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method would split the path into an array of strings using `/` as the separator, and the `pop()` method would return the last element of the array, which could be a different path than the original `path` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.replace(/\//g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace()` method would replace all occurrences of `/` in the path with an empty string, which could cause the `matches()` method to return `false` even if the path is a match.

DONE.
