  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part of spec.split('/').slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the `reverse()` method, which is used to reverse the order of the array returned by `split()`. Without `reverse()`, the resulting array would be in the opposite order, which could cause unexpected behavior in the rest of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part of spec.split('').slice(1).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the string into individual characters instead of splitting it by `/`. This would cause the resulting array to have a different structure, which could affect the rest of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part of spec.split('/').slice(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first two elements of the array returned by `split()`. This could cause the resulting array to have a different structure, which could affect the rest of the code.
