  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that returns a promise that is rejected with the given reason, whereas `Q` is a promisification library.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function and would cause an error if called like a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('Cannot promisify undefined')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error if `undefined` is passed as the `promisify` or `thenResolve` argument to the `Q` function.

DONE.
