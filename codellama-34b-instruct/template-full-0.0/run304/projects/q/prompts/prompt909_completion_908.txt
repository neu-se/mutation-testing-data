  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would cause the `nodeArgs` array to have one element, whereas the replaced code fragment would cause the `nodeArgs` array to have zero elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would cause the `nodeArgs` array to have one element, whereas the replaced code fragment would cause the `nodeArgs` array to have two elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would cause the `nodeArgs` array to have one element, whereas the replaced code fragment would cause the `nodeArgs` array to have no elements.

DONE.
