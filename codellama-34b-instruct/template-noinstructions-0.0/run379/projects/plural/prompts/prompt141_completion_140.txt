  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word, rule[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rule[1]` function would be called with the wrong argument, leading to a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0], word
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rule[0]` function would be called with the wrong argument, leading to a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word, rule[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rule[0]` function would be called with the wrong argument, leading to a different output.

DONE.
