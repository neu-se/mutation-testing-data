  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split("@")[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method would return an array with the filename and line number separated by a space, rather than a string with the filename and line number separated by a colon.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.replace(/^.*@/, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace()` method would remove the function name and the `@` symbol from the beginning of the string, rather than just the `@` symbol.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.substring(stackLine.indexOf("@") + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring()` method would return the substring starting from the index of the `@` symbol, rather than the substring starting from the beginning of the string.

DONE.
