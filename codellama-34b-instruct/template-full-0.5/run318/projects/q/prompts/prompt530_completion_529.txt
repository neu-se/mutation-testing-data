  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 2, regardless of the value of `object`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `null`, regardless of the value of `object`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `undefined`, regardless of the value of `object`.

DONE.
