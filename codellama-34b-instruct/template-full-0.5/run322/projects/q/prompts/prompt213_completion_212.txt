  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value instanceof Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `instanceof` checks if an object is an instance of a class, while `isPromiseAlike` checks if an object has the necessary properties and methods to be considered a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method that is typically used to chain promises, while `isPromiseAlike` checks if an object has the necessary properties and methods to be considered a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.constructor.name === "Promise"
```
This would result in different behavior because `constructor.name` returns the name of the constructor function that created the object, while `isPromiseAlike` checks if an object has the necessary properties and methods to be considered a promise.

DONE.
