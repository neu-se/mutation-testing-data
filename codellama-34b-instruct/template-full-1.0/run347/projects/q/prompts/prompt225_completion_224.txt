  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `messages` is an array, and `messages.pop()` would return the last element of the array, which is not a function, so it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
longStackCounter++
```
This would result in different behavior because `longStackCounter` is a counter that is incremented every time a promise is created, and it is used to associate stack traces with the promises. If this line is replaced with `longStackCounter++`, it would increment the counter, but it would not associate the stack trace with the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListeners.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `progressListeners` is an array of functions that are called when progress is made on a promise, and `progressListeners.shift()` would return the first element of the array, which is a function, and would call it with
