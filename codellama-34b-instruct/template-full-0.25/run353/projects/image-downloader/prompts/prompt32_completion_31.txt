  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode !== 300
```
This would result in different behavior because the status code 300 is a valid response code, but the original code fragment only checks for a status code of 200.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode === 404
```
This would result in different behavior because the status code 404 is a valid response code, but the original code fragment only checks for a status code of 200.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode !== 200 && res.statusCode !== 300
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks for a status code of 200, but this new code fragment checks for both 200 and 300.

DONE.
