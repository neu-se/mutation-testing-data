  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-\s]*$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it allows for whitespace characters to be part of the match, which the original code fragment does not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.-]*$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it does not allow for the `+` and `*` characters to be part of the match, which the original code fragment does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.*+-]*$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it allows for the `.` character to be part of the match, which the original code fragment does not.

DONE.
