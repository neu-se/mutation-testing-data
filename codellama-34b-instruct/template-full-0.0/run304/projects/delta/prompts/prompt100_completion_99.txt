  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp && typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' && lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is negating the condition, causing the `if` statement to be entered even if `lastOp.attributes` is `null` or `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp && typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' && lastOp.attributes.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property is being checked instead of the `attributes` property itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp && typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' && lastOp.attributes.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property is being checked for a specific value instead of just checking if it is truthy.

DONE.
