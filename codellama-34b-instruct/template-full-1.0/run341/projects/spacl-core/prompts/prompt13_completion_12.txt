  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^/]:|\/:|:$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow matches that start with a colon, which is not allowed in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/:\/|[^/]:|:$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow matches that start with a colon, which is not allowed in the original code fragment, and it would also allow matches that start with a forward slash, which is not allowed in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^/]:|:\/)|:$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow matches that start with a colon, which is not allowed in the original code fragment, and it would also allow matches that start with a forward slash, which is not allowed in the original code fragment.

DONE.
