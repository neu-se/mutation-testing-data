  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` when `ops` is an empty array, whereas the original code fragment would return `true` in that case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.length >= 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when `ops` is non-empty, whereas the original code fragment would return `true` only when `ops` contains at least one element that is not `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.some(op => op !== null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when `ops` contains at least one non-null element, whereas the original code fragment would return `true` only when `ops` contains at least one element that is not `null`.

DONE.
