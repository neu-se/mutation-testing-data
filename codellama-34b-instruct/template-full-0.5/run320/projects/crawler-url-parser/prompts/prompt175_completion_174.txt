  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(url.replace("https", "http"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would be called with a modified URL that has "http" instead of "https", which could cause the function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(url.split(":")[1])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would be called with a different argument, which could cause the function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(url.replace("https://", ""))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would be called with a modified URL that has the "https://" prefix removed, which could cause the function to return a different result.

DONE.
