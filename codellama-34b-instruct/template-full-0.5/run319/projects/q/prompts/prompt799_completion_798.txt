  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with `undefined` instead of the original value of `object`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with `null` instead of the original value of `object`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with `0` instead of the original value of `object`.

DONE.
