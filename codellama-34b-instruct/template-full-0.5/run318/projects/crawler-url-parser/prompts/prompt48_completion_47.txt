  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.resolve` returns a resolved URL string, while `URL.parse` returns a URL object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of `URL.parse` specifies whether to parse the query string or not. If set to `false`, the query string will not be parsed, which may result in different behavior if the query string contains important information.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument of `URL.parse` specifies whether to parse the fragment identifier or not. If set to `false`, the fragment identifier will not be parsed, which may result in different behavior if the fragment identifier contains important information.

DONE.
