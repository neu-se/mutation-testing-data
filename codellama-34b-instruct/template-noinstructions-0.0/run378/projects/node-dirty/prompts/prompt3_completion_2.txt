  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val == undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true`, even if `val` is not `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate to `true` only if `val` is `null`, but not if it is `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof val === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate to `true` only if `val` is `undefined`, but not if it is `null` or any other type.

DONE.
