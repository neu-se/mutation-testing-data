  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork
```
This change will cause the `uncork` method to be called on the `this._writeStream` object, which is not the intended behavior. The `uncork` method is used to release the buffering of a stream, but in this case, it is not necessary and will likely cause unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write(data, (err) => {
  if (!cbs.length && err != null) this.emit('error', err);
  if (--this._inFlightWrites <= 0 && !this._waitForDrain) this.emit('drain');
  for (const cb of cbs) cb(err);
});
```
This change will cause the `write` method to be called on the `this._writeStream` object with the `data` argument and a callback function that emits an `error` event if there is an error and an `drain` event if
