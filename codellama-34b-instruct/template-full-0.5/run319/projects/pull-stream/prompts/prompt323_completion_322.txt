  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd && onEnd()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `onEnd` is a reference to a function, while the new code fragment `onEnd && onEnd()` is a reference to a function that is only called if `onEnd` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd || onEnd()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `onEnd` is a reference to a function, while the new code fragment `onEnd || onEnd()` is a reference to a function that is only called if `onEnd` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `onEnd` is a reference to a function, while the new code fragment `onEnd !== undefined` is a check to see if `onEnd` is not equal to `undefined`.

DONE.
