 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates an empty object instead of inheriting the `current` and `all` properties from the `result[country]` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ current: [], all: [] }
```
This would result in different behavior because it initializes both `current` and `all` arrays as empty arrays, discarding any existing values in the `result[country]` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.assign({}, result[country])
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of the `result[country]` object, but does not update the `result[country]` object itself. This could lead to inconsistencies in the data structure if other parts of the code rely on the original `result[country]` object being updated.

DONE.
