  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cub
```
This would result in different behavior because 'cub' is a different function than 'cb'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(err);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would log the error to the console instead of calling the callback function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
none
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not call the callback function at all.

DONE.
