  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `error` would be null and would not be thrown as an exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Error"
```
This would result in different behavior because `error` would be the string "Error" and would not be thrown as an exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because `error` would be a new `Error` object and would be thrown as an exception.

DONE.
