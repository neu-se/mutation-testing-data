  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof arg === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for a string with length 0, but this replacement checks for any type of object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg instanceof String
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `typeof` operator, which returns a string indicating the type of the operand, while this replacement uses the `instanceof` operator, which checks if the operand is an instance of a particular class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for a string with length 0, but this replacement checks for any object with a length property equal to 0.

DONE.
