  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(10)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance by 10 elements instead of by 1, which could potentially cause the code to skip over important operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to move backward instead of forward, which could potentially cause the code to access elements that it should not access.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(Infinity)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance to the end of the list, which could potentially cause the code to skip over important operations.

DONE.
