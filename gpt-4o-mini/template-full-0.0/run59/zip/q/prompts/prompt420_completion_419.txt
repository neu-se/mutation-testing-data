Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect().state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly return `true` for both fulfilled and pending promises, leading to false positives when checking if a promise is pending.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect().state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly return `true` for rejected promises, causing the method to indicate that a promise is pending when it is actually rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect().state !== "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` for fulfilled and rejected promises, thus failing to accurately identify pending promises and leading to incorrect logic in promise handling.

DONE.
