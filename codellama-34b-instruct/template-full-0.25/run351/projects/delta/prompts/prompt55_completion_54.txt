  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(ops)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isArray` checks if the argument is an array, but `ops` is not an array, it's an object with an `ops` property that is an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `ops.ops` is an array, and `ops.ops.length` would return the length of the array, which is not the same as checking if `ops` is an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ops === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof ops` would return `'object'`, but `ops` is not an object, it's a function.

DONE.
