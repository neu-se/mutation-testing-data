  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, value
```
This change will cause the `nodeback` function to be called with `undefined` as the first argument, which may cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses this function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value, null
```
This change will cause the `nodeback` function to be called with `null` as the second argument, which may cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses this function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value, undefined
```
This change will cause the `nodeback` function to be called with `undefined` as the second argument, which may cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses this function.

DONE.
