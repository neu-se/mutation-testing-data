Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the fulfilled callback to always return `null`, regardless of the actual value, potentially leading to loss of the original value that was supposed to be passed through.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the fulfilled callback to return `undefined`, which is different from the original value, thus altering the expected output of the promise chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(new Error("Error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a new error instead of resolving with the original value, leading to a failure in the promise chain where the original value was expected.

DONE.
