  Sure, here are three options for replacing the `PLACEHOLDER` in the `Dirty` class code with different logic that would result in different behavior:

Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.close()
```
This would result in the write stream being closed immediately after the first write operation, instead of waiting for all the write operations to complete.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.pipe(this._writeStream)
```
This would result in the read stream being piped to the write stream, instead of writing the data to the file directly.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write(data, () => {
    this._inFlightWrites--;
    if (this._inFlightWrites <= 0) {
        this.emit('drain');
    }
});
```
This would result in the write stream being closed after all the write operations
