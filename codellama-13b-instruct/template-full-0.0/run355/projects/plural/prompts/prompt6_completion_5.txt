  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method is called on the `obj` object, which may not be the same as the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `valueOf()` method is called on the `obj` object, which may not be the same as the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.toLocaleString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLocaleString()` method is called on the `obj` object, which may not be the same as the original code fragment.

DONE.
