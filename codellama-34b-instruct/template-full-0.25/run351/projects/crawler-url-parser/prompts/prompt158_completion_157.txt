  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regex pattern would cause the regex engine to perform a global match, finding all matches in the input string, rather than just the first match.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regex pattern would cause the regex engine to perform a case-insensitive match, so the regex would also match strings that contain uppercase letters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/m
```
This would result in different behavior because the `m` flag at the end of the regex pattern would cause the regex engine to perform a multi-line match, so the regex would also match strings that contain newline characters.
