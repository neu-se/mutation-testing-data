  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve("hello")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always resolve the promise with the string "hello", regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always call the `inspect` method on the original promise, rather than the deferred promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises[index] = deferred.resolve(promises[index])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always resolve the deferred promise with the value of `promises[index]`, rather than the value of `promise`.

DONE.
