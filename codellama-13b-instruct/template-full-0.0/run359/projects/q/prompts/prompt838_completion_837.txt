  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called with `null` as the first and second arguments, which would cause the promise to be rejected immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called with a function as the first argument, which would cause the promise to be resolved immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () { throw new Error() })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called with a function as the first argument that throws an error, which would cause the promise to be rejected.

DONE.
