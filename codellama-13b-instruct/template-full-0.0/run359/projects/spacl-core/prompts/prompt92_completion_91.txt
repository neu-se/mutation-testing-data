  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const policy = policies[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only add the first policy in the `policies` array to the `PolicyMap`, whereas the original code fragment adds all policies in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const policy = policies.find((p) => p.name === name)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only add policies with a matching name to the `PolicyMap`, whereas the original code fragment adds all policies in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const policy = policies.find((p) => p.name === name)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only add policies with a matching name to the `PolicyMap`, whereas the original code fragment adds all policies in the array.

DONE.
