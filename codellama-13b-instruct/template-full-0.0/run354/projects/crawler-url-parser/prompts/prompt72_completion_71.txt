  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attr` method is used to retrieve the value of the `href` attribute of the `base` element, whereas the original code fragment uses the `attr` method to retrieve the value of the `href` attribute of the `a` element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').attr('href').replace(/;.*$/g,"")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method is used to remove any semicolon and everything after it from the value of the `href` attribute of the `base` element, whereas the original code fragment does not modify the value of the `href` attribute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').attr('href').replace(/;.*$/g,"").replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'http://')
```
This would result in different
