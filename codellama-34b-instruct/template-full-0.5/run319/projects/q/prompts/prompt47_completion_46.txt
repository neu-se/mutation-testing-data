  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!domain
```
This would result in different behavior because `!domain` will always be `true` when `domain` is not null or undefined, regardless of its actual value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `domain + 1` would always be a different value than `domain`, even if `domain` is null or undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.foo
```
This would result in different behavior because `domain.foo` would always be `undefined` when `domain` is null or undefined, regardless of its actual value.

DONE.
