  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` checks if a number is finite, while `isNaN` checks if a number is not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isZero` checks if a number is zero, while `isNaN` checks if a number is not a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite` checks if a number is infinite, while `isNaN` checks if a number is not a number.

DONE.
