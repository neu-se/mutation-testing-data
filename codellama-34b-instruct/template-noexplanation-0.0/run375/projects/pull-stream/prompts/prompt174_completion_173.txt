  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length - 1
```
This change will cause the code to iterate over the array one less time than it should, potentially missing the last element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length + 1
```
This change will cause the code to iterate over the array one more time than it should, potentially leading to an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length / 2
```
This change will cause the code to iterate over half of the array, potentially missing some elements.

DONE.
