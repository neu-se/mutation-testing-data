  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is empty, which would remove the "default" part of the URL, potentially changing the meaning of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, 'default'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is "default", which would replace the "default" part of the URL with itself, potentially changing the meaning of the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, 'default.html'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is "default.html", which would replace the "default" part of the URL with "default.html", potentially changing the meaning of the URL.

DONE.
