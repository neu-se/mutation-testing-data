  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` is a different method than `push`, and it would change the way the `other` delta is added to the `delta` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` is a different method than `push`, and it would change the way the `other` delta is added to the `delta` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` is a different method than `push`, and it would change the way the `other` delta is added to the `delta` object.

DONE.
