Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of the `args` array, which may not include any modifications made to the original `args` array after this line, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat([])
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array by concatenating `args` with an empty array, which is functionally similar but may lead to confusion regarding the intent of copying the array, and it could introduce performance overhead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.map(x => x)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array by mapping each element of `args` to itself, which is unnecessary and could lead to performance issues, while also potentially altering the type of elements if any transformation is applied in the future.

DONE.
