  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (index <= length) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code has a `>=` operator, which means the loop will continue until `index` is greater than or equal to `length`, whereas this modified code will continue until `index` is less than or equal to `length`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (index < length) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code has a `>=` operator, which means the loop will continue until `index` is greater than or equal to `length`, whereas this modified code will continue until `index` is strictly less than `length`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (index != length) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code has a `>=` operator, which means the loop will continue until `index` is greater than or equal to `length`, whereas this modified code will continue until `index` is not equal to `length
