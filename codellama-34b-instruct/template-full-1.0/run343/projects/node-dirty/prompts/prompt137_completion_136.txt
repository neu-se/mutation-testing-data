  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data.set` is a setter method that updates the value of an existing key in the `this._data` object, whereas `this._data.get` is a getter method that retrieves the value of a key in the `this._data` object. Using `this._data.set` instead of `this._data.get` would change the behavior of the code and potentially cause errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.+)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data.++` is a postfix increment operator that increments the value of a key in the `this._data` object by 1, whereas `this._data.get` is a getter method that retrieves the value of a key in the `this._data` object. Using `this._data.++` instead of `this._data.get` would change the behavior of the code and potentially cause errors.
