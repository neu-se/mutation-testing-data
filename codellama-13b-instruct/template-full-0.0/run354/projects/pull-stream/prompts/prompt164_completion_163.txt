  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function is called, which would cause the callback to be called with an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback is called with a truthy value, which would cause the `values` function to return a truthy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i++])
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback is called with a falsy value, which would cause the `values` function to return a falsy value.

DONE.
