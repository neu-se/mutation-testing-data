  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.exit
```
This would result in different behavior because `domain.exit` would be called twice, which could cause issues if the domain is not properly reset.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.exit(e)
```
This would result in different behavior because `domain.exit` would be called with an error object, which could cause the domain to be exited with an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.exit(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `domain.exit` would be called with a null error object, which could cause the domain to be exited without an error.

DONE.
