Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'timezone'
```
This would result in different behavior because it hardcodes the timezone name to 'timezone', which would not match any actual timezone in the data, leading to a failure to retrieve the correct countries.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzName.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it transforms the timezone name to uppercase, which may not match the casing used in the `timezones` object, potentially resulting in a failure to find the correct timezone.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` would cause the `getTimezone` function to attempt to retrieve a timezone with an undefined name, leading to unexpected results or errors when trying to access properties of the returned value.

DONE.
