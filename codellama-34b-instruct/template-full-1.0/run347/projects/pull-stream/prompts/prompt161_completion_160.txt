  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `null` as the second argument, regardless of the value of `value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true, _value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` as the first argument, and the value of `value` would be passed as the second argument, regardless of its value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, 'error')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `null` as the first argument, and the string `'error'` would be passed as the second argument, regardless of the value of `value`.

DONE.
