  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.delay(bound)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.delay` expects a promise or a thenable as its first argument, but `bound` is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fapply(bound)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fapply` expects a promise or a thenable as its first argument, but `bound` is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nfapply(bound)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nfapply` expects a promise or a thenable as its first argument, but `bound` is a function.

DONE.
