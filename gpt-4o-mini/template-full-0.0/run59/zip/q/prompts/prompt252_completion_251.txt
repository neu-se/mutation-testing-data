Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.promiseDispatch.call(newPromise, message);
```
This would result in different behavior because using `call` instead of `apply` would pass the `message` as a single argument instead of an array, potentially causing the promise dispatch to fail if it expects multiple arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.promiseDispatch.apply(null, message);
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` as the context for `apply` would result in the `this` value inside `promiseDispatch` being `null`, which could lead to errors if `promiseDispatch` relies on `this` to access properties or methods of `newPromise`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.promiseDispatch.apply(resolvedPromise, [message]);
```
This would result in different behavior because using `resolvedPromise` as the context instead of `newPromise` would mean that the method is executed in the context of the resolved promise, which may not have the same properties or methods as the new promise, leading to unexpected results.

DONE.
