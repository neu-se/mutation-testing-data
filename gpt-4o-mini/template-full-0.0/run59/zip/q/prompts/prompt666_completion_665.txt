Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the starting index for the arguments array, causing the first argument to be ignored instead of included in the function call.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the starting index for the arguments array, effectively skipping the first argument and only passing the rest to the dispatched function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the total number of arguments as the starting index, which would lead to an empty array being sent to the dispatched function, potentially causing it to fail or behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
