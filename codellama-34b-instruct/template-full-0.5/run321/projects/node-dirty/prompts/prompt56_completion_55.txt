  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this.close(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` method would be called with an additional argument, which could cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this.close(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` method would be called with a different argument, which could cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this.close()
```
This would result in the same behavior as the original code, as the `close` method would be called with no arguments.

DONE.
