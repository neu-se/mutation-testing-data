  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + places
```
This would result in a different value because the `+` operator is used instead of the `*` operator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] / places
```
This would result in a different value because the `/` operator is used instead of the `*` operator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places - this['re']
```
This would result in a different value because the subtraction operator is used instead of the multiplication operator.

DONE.
