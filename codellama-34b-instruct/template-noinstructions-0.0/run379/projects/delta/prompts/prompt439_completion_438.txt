  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `nextOp.retain` is an object and not null, while this replacement checks if it is a number. This could cause the code to behave differently if `nextOp.retain` is an object or null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `nextOp.retain` is an object and not null, while this replacement checks if it is a string. This could cause the code to behave differently if `nextOp.retain` is an object or null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `nextOp.retain` is an object and not null, while this replacement checks if it is
