  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the latitude of the second point instead of the first point, which is a different value and would give a different calculation result for the bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1 + φ2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the latitude of the first point to the latitude of the second point, which would give a different calculation result for the bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(φ1 - φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the latitude of the second point from the latitude of the first point, which would give a different calculation result for the bearing.

DONE.
