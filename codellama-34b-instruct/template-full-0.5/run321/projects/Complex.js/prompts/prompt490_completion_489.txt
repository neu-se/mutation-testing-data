  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex, "__esModule", { 'value': false }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the `__esModule` property from `true` to `false`, which could affect how the module is loaded and used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex, "__esModule", { 'value': undefined }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the `__esModule` property from the `Complex` object, which could cause issues if other code relies on the presence of that property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex, "__esModule", { 'value': null }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the `__esModule` property from `true` to `null`, which could affect how the module is loaded and used.

DONE.
