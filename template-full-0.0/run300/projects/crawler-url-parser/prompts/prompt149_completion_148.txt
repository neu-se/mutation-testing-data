  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split("/").filter(function (elem, index, array) {
    return elem.length > 0
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method is not being called on the same array as the `split` method. In the original code, the `filter` method is called on the result of the `split` method, which is an array of strings. In this modified code, the `filter` method is called on the `pageurl_path` string, which is not an array and does not have a `filter` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split("/").filter(function (elem, index, array) {
    return elem.length > 1
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method is being called with a different predicate function. In the original code, the predicate function checks if the length of the element is greater than 0. In this modified code, the predicate function checks if
