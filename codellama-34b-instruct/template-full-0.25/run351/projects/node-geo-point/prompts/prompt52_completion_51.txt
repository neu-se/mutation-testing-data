  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(θ) * sin(δ) * cos(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `sin` function to calculate the y-coordinate of the destination point, while this replacement uses the `sin` function to calculate the x-coordinate.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(θ) * sin(δ) * cos(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `cos` function to calculate the x-coordinate of the destination point, while this replacement uses the `sin` function.

DONE.
