  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key
```
This would result in different behavior because `row.key` is the key of the object, not the value, and would cause the code to set the value of the object to the key instead of the value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to set the value of the object to the sum of the value and 1, instead of just the value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to set the value of the object to twice the value, instead of just the value.

DONE.
