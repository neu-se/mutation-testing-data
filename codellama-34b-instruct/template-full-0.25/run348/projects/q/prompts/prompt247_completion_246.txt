  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `e.stack.length` returns the length of the stack trace, whereas `e.stack.substring` returns a portion of the stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.indexOf("at")
```
This would result in different behavior because `e.stack.indexOf("at")` returns the index of the first occurrence of the string "at" in the stack trace, whereas `e.stack.substring` returns a portion of the stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.split("\n")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `e.stack.split("\n")[0]` returns the first line of the stack trace, whereas `e.stack.substring` returns a portion of the stack trace.

DONE.
