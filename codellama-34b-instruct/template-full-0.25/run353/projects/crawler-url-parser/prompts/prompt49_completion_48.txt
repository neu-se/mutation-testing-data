  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(parsedBaseUrl, parsedUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.parse()` expects a string as its first argument, but `parsedBaseUrl` is an object returned by `URL.parse()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.format(parsedBaseUrl, parsedUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.format()` expects an object as its first argument, but `parsedBaseUrl` is a string returned by `URL.parse()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve(parsedBaseUrl.href, parsedUrl.href)
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.resolve()` expects a string as its first argument, but `parsedBaseUrl` is an object returned by `URL.parse()`.

DONE.
