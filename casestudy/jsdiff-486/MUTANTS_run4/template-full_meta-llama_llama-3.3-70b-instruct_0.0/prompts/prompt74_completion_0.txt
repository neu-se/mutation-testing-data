Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
key in obj
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for property existence in the prototype chain, whereas the original code only checks for own properties, potentially including inherited properties in the iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!obj.hasOwnProperty(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the condition, excluding own properties instead of including them, which would lead to different keys being processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof obj[key] !== 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it only includes properties with non-function values, whereas the original code includes all own properties regardless of their value type.

DONE.
