 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([^/])/g
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches any character except '/' instead of '.' or '$'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([\W])/g
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches any non-word character instead of '.' or '$'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([.$)\s]/g
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches '.', '$', ')', or whitespace characters.

By introducing these changes, we can evaluate if the test suite is able to detect the differences in behavior, which would indicate potential weaknesses in the test suite. DONE.
