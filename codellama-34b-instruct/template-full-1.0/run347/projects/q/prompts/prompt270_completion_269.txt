  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason = null
```
This would result in different behavior because if the reason is null, the code would not throw an error, and the promise would be resolved instead of rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason = "something else"
```
This would result in different behavior because if the reason is a different string, the promise would be rejected with a different reason, and the error handling code would not execute as expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("something else")
```
This would result in different behavior because if a different error is thrown, the error handling code would not execute as expected, and the promise would be rejected with a different reason.

DONE.
