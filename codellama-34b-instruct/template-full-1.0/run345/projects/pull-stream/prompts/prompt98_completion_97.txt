  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test
```
This would result in different behavior because `test` is a function, but `cb` is not, so the `cb` function would not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb()` is a function call, but `cb` by itself is not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop(test)
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop(test)` is a function call, but `test` by itself is not. `prop` is a function that returns a function, so `prop(test)` would return a different function than `test`.

DONE.
