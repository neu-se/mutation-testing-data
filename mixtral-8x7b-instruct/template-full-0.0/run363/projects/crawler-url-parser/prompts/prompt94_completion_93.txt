 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'./'
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the `href` to a relative path, which might not be correctly parsed by the `parse` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the `href` to `null`, which would cause the `parse` function to return `null` and skip processing the link.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'javascript:alert("Mutation testing!");'
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the `href` to a JavaScript URL, which would not be correctly parsed by the `parse` function and could potentially introduce security vulnerabilities.

DONE.
