  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would bind the `array_slice` function to `this`, which would affect the behavior of the `Q.nmapply` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `array_slice` function with `this` as the `this` value, which would affect the behavior of the `Q.nmapply` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.slice.call(array_slice, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `slice` function with `array_slice` as the `this` value, which would affect the behavior of the `Q.nmapply` function.

DONE.
