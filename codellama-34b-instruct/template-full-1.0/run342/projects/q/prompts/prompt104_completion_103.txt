  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
incrementedIndex
```
This would result in different behavior because `incrementedIndex` is not the same as `index`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decrementedIndex
```
This would result in different behavior because `decrementedIndex` is not the same as `index`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index *= 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `index` would be multiplied by 2, rather than being incremented or decremented by 1.

DONE.
