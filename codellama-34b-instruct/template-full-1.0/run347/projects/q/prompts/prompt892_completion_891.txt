  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer()` creates a new deferred object, while `Q` is a function that returns a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.makeDeferred()
```
This would result in different behavior because `makeDeferred()` is a function that returns a new deferred object, while `Q` is a function that returns a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.Value()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.Value()` is a function that returns a promise, while `Q` is a function that returns a promise.

DONE.
