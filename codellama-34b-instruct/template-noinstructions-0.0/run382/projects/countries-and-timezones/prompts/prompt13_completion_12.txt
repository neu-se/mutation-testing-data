  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [country]: { current: [id], all: [] } }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add the current timezone to the list of all timezones, even if it is not the current timezone.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [country]: { current: [], all: [id] } }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add the current timezone to the list of all timezones, even if it is not the current timezone.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [country]: { current: [id], all: [id] } }

This would result in different behavior because it would always add the current timezone to the list of all timezones, even if it is not the current timezone.

DONE.
