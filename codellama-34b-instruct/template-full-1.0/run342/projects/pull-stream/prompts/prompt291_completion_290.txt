  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return `false`, whereas the original code fragment would return `true` if the item had been seen before.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return `null`, whereas the original code fragment would return `true` if the item had been seen before.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!field
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return the opposite of `field`, whereas the original code fragment would return `true` if the item had been seen before.

DONE.
