  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length === other.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the two ops have the same number of elements, rather than checking if they are the same object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length === other.ops.length && this.ops.every((op, i) => op === other.ops[i])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the two ops have the same number of elements and if every element in the first op is equal to the corresponding element in the second op, rather than checking if they are the same object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length === other.ops.length && this.ops.every((op, i) => op.retain === other.ops[i].retain)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the two ops have the same number of elements
