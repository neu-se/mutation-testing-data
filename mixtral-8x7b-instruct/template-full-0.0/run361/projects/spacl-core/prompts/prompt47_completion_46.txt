 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/[^/]+/
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches one or more characters that are not a slash, instead of matching any character including a slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/:.?/
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches any character (including a slash) followed by zero or one character, instead of matching any character (including a slash) one or more times.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/:[a-zA-Z0-9_]+/
```
This would result in different behavior because it only matches alphanumeric characters and underscores after the slash, instead of matching any character.

DONE.
