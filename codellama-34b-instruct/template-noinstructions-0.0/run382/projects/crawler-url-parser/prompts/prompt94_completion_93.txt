  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
This would result in different behavior because the `href` attribute is being modified to remove the protocol (e.g. `http://` or `https://`) from the beginning of the URL. This could potentially cause the URL to be interpreted differently by the `parse` function, leading to a different result.
