  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function is not being called with the correct arguments. The `abortCb` function expects three arguments: `cb`, `abort`, and `onAbort`. However, in the mutated code, the `abortCb` function is being called with only two arguments: `cb` and `abort`. This would cause the `abortCb` function to behave differently than it would in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function is being called with the correct arguments, but the order of the arguments is different than in the original code. In the original code, the `abortCb` function is called with the arguments `cb`, `abort`, and `onAbort`. In the mutated code, the `
