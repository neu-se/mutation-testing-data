  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejected` is a different value than `fulfilled`, and it would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a value that the promise can be fulfilled with, and it would cause the promise to be rejected with a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a value that the promise can be fulfilled with, but it would cause the promise to be resolved with a different value than the original code fragment.

DONE.
