  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] + this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add the real parts of the two complex numbers, whereas the original code fragment subtracted them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] * this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would multiply the real parts of the two complex numbers, whereas the original code fragment subtracted them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] / this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `/` operator would divide the real parts of the two complex numbers, whereas the original code fragment subtracted them.

DONE.
