  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[0], 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always return the first argument passed to the function, instead of the second argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[0] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always return the first argument plus 1, instead of the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[1] - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always return the second argument minus 1, instead of the second argument.

DONE.
