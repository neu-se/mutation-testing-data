  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is used to reject the promise, while `deferred.resolve` is used to resolve the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(rejection)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is used to reject the promise, while `deferred.notify` is used to notify the promise of progress.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is used to reject the promise, while `deferred.inspect` is used to inspect the state of the promise.

DONE.
