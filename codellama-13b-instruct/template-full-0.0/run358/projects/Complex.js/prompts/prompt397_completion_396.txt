  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['asin']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `asin` method is not defined for complex numbers, whereas the `asinh` method is defined. This would cause the code to throw an error when attempting to call the `asin` method on a complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['acos']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `acos` method is not defined for complex numbers, whereas the `acosh` method is defined. This would cause the code to throw an error when attempting to call the `acos` method on a complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['atan']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan` method is not defined for complex numbers, whereas the `atanh` method is defined. This would cause the code to throw an error when attempting to call the `atan` method on a complex number.

DONE.
