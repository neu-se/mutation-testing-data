  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { this.emit('drain'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function is not being executed anymore, which could cause issues if the code relies on the callback to perform certain actions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { if (cb) cb(new Error('Some error')); this.emit('drain'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function is now being called with an error, which could cause the code to behave differently in case of errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { if (cb) cb(); this.emit('drain', new Error('Some error')); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'drain' event is now being emitted with an error, which could cause the code to behave differently in case of errors.

DONE.
