  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes, thisOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the attributes of the current operation with the attributes of the previous operation, rather than with the attributes of the operation in the base delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes, otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the attributes of the current operation with the attributes of the next operation, rather than with the attributes of the operation in the base delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes, baseOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the attributes of the current operation with the attributes of the operation in the base delta, rather than with the attributes of the previous or next operation.

DONE.
