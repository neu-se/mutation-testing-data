Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(http|https):/.test
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only allow URLs that start with "http:" or "https:", thus excluding "javascript:", "mailto:", and "ftp:" URLs, which may lead to incorrect filtering of valid links.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(mailto:|ftp:)/.test
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check for "mailto:" and "ftp:" URLs, allowing "javascript:" URLs to pass through, which could lead to security vulnerabilities by allowing potentially harmful links.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(file:|data:)/.test
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow "file:" and "data:" URLs, which are typically not intended for web navigation, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or security issues by allowing local file access or data URIs.

DONE.
