  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus > minus
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if there are more plus signs than minus signs, while this new code fragment checks if the number of plus signs is greater than the number of minus signs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
minus > plus
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if there are more plus signs than minus signs, while this new code fragment checks if the number of minus signs is greater than the number of plus signs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus !== minus
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if there are more plus signs than minus signs, while this new code fragment checks if the number of plus signs is not equal to the number of minus signs.

DONE.
