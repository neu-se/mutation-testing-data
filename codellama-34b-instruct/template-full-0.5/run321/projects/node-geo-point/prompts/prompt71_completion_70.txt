  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.PI` constant is added to the `θ` value, which would cause the bearing calculation to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `1` constant is added to the `θ` value, which would cause the bearing calculation to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `1` constant is subtracted from the `θ` value, which would cause the bearing calculation to be incorrect.

DONE.
