  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + tokens[i]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i+1` index is replaced with `i`, which would cause the code to access the current token instead of the next one, potentially leading to incorrect parsing of the input string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + tokens[i-1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i+1` index is replaced with `i-1`, which would cause the code to access the previous token instead of the next one, potentially leading to incorrect parsing of the input string.
