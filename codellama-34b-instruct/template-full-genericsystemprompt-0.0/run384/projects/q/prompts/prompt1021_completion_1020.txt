  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument `null` is added to the `nodeArgs` array, which would cause the `nodeArgs` array to have a different length than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs.slice(0, -1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the last element of the `nodeArgs` array is removed, which would cause the `nodeArgs` array to have a different length than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs.concat([null])]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra `null` element is added to the `nodeArgs` array, which would cause the `nodeArgs` array to have a different length than the original code fragment.

DONE.
