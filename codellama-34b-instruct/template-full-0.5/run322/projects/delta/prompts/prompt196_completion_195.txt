  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would select the second-to-last operation in the delta, rather than the last operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would select the first operation in the delta, rather than the last operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the delta's operations array, rather than the last operation.

DONE.
