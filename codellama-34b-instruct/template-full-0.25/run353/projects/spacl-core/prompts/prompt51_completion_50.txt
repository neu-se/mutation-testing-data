  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `min` variable would be set to 0 instead of 1, which would allow the regex to match an empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `min` variable would be set to 2 instead of 1, which would require the regex to match at least two characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `min` variable would be set to -1, which would allow the regex to match a negative number of characters.

DONE.
