  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(otherOp.delete);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` method expects an integer or an object as its argument, but `otherOp.delete` is an object. This would cause a type error, which would make the test fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete(otherOp.delete);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` method expects an integer or an object as its argument, but `otherOp.delete` is an object. This would cause a type error, which would make the test fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherOp.delete);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method expects an object as its argument, but `otherOp.delete` is an integer. This would cause a type error, which would make the test fail.

DONE.
