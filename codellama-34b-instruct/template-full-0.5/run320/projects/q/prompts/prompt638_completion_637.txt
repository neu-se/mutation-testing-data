  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the value of `key` as the second argument to `dispatch`, instead of passing the value of `key` as the first argument and `value` as the second argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[value]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the value of `value` as the first argument to `dispatch`, instead of passing the value of `key` as the first argument and `value` as the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the value of `key` as both the first and second arguments to `dispatch`, instead of passing the value of `key` as the first argument and `value` as the second argument.

DONE.
