  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.resolve(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because previously, the `closed.resolve` method was called with no arguments, whereas now it is called with an `error` argument. This change would cause the `error` to be thrown immediately instead of being propagated to the caller.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var resolved = Q.defer();
resolved.resolve(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because previously, the `closed` promise was resolved with an unsettled promise `Q.defer()`, whereas now it is resolved with a settled promise `Q.defer().resolve(error)`. This change would cause the `error` to be passed to the `closed` handler instead of being ignored.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var resolved = Q.defer();
resolved.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because previously, the `closed` promise was resolved with an un
