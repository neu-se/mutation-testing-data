  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substring
```
This change will cause the function to return a different result than the original code fragment, which was `w.substr`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.slice
```
This change will also cause the function to return a different result than the original code fragment, which was `w.substr`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substring(1)
```
This change will cause the function to return a different result than the original code fragment, which was `w.substr`.

DONE.
