  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("set", [key, value])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the property `key` to `value` instead of deleting it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("get", [key])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would get the property `key` instead of deleting it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [key, value])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would post the property `key` with the value `value` instead of deleting it.

DONE.
