  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"=="
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `split` method to split the string at every occurrence of the "=" character, rather than just the first occurrence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"!="
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `split` method to split the string at every occurrence of the "!" character, rather than just the first occurrence.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"?"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `split` method to split the string at every occurrence of the "?" character, rather than just the first occurrence.

DONE.
