  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would start from the second argument instead of the first, which could cause the `name` argument to be excluded from the resulting array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would only include the first two arguments in the resulting array, which could cause the `args` argument to be excluded.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 1, -1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would only include the first and last arguments in the resulting array, which could cause the `args` argument to be excluded.

DONE.
