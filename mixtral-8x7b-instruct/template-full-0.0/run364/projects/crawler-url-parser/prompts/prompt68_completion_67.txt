 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => parse
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a function that returns the `parse` function, instead of directly calling `parse`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'parse'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the `parse` function call to a string, which would cause a TypeError when executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
require('../not-existing-module').parse
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to import the `parse` function from a non-existent module, causing a "MODULE\_NOT\_FOUND" error.

DONE.
