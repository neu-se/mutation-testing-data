  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be passed as the callback, instead of the actual callback function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as the callback, instead of the actual callback function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty function would be passed as the callback, instead of the actual callback function.

DONE.
