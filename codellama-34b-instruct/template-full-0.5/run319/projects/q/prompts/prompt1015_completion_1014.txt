  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array would have a `null` value at the end, which would cause the `dispatch` method to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array would have an `undefined` value at the end, which would cause the `dispatch` method to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array would have a function value at the end, which would cause the `dispatch` method to fail.

DONE.
