  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned `true` when the iterator was done, but the mutated code fragment returns `false` in that case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!array[i++]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned `true` when the iterator was done, but the mutated code fragment returns the negation of the current element in the array, which may not be the same as `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i++] >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned `true` when the iterator was done, but the mutated code fragment returns a boolean indicating whether the current element is positive or negative, which may not be the same as `true`.

DONE.
