Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0 || b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if either `a` or `b` is not zero, which would lead to the function returning a `Complex(0, Math.PI / 2)` when either part of the complex number is non-zero, contrary to the original condition that only returns this value when both parts are zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0 && b < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for a specific condition where `a` is positive and `b` is negative, which would cause the function to return `Complex(0, Math.PI / 2)` only under this specific scenario, rather than when both `a` and `b` are zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 1 && b === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for a specific case where both `a` and `b` are equal to 1, which would lead to the function returning `Complex
