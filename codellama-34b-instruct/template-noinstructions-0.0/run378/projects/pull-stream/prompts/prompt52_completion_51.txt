  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `read` is a function that takes an argument, but `null` is not a function and would cause a type error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `read` is a function that takes an argument, but `undefined` is not a function and would cause a type error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `read` is a function that takes an argument, but `{}` is an empty object and would not cause a type error, but it would also not have the same behavior as the original code fragment.

DONE.
