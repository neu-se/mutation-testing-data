Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof arg !== 'string' || arg.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow non-string types or non-empty strings to pass through, which would not be the case with the original condition that checks for an empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg === NULL_CHARACTER
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `arg` is equal to the `NULL_CHARACTER`, which is a specific character, rather than checking if `arg` is an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg.length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces an invalid condition, as string lengths cannot be negative, thus always evaluating to false and allowing the operation to proceed regardless of the actual content of `arg`.

DONE.
