  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromise = function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromise` would no longer be a function and would always return `undefined`, which would cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromise = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromise` would be a number and not a function, which would cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromise = function () { return 'Hello World'; }
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromise` would no longer be a function that returns a promise, but a function that returns a string, which would cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
