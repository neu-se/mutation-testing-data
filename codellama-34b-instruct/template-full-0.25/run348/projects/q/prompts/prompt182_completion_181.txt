  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split("\n")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first line of the stack trace, which may not contain the information needed to determine the file name and line number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split("\n")[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the second line of the stack trace, which may not contain the information needed to determine the file name and line number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split("\n").slice(-1)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the last line of the stack trace, which may not contain the information needed to determine the file name and line number.

DONE.
