  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking for words that end in `eo` or `EO`, but the replacement code only checks for words that end in `o` or `O`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[^aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' })

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[aeiouy]o$|[^aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) {
