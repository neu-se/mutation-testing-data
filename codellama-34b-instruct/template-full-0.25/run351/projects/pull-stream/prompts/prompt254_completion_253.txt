  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (err === true) nextStream()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the presence of an error object, while this replacement checks for the presence of a boolean value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (err === false) nextStream()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the presence of an error object, while this replacement checks for the absence of a boolean value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

DONE.
