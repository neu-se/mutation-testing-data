  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/a/, 'e')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/a/` matches the letter "a" in the word "man," but the replacement string "e" does not match the expected output "men."

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/e/, 'a')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/e/` matches the letter "e" in the word "man," but the replacement string "a" does not match the expected output "men."

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/man/, 'men')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/man/` matches the word "man" in the input, but the replacement string "men" does not match the expected output "men."

DONE.
