  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'http://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would be called on the `baseUrlStr` variable, which is not the same as the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'https://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would be called on the `baseUrlStr` variable with a different replacement string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would be called on the `baseUrlStr` variable with an empty replacement string.

DONE.
