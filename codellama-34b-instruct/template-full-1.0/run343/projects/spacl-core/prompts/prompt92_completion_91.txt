  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const policy of policies.slice()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice() function creates a new array, which is not the same as the original array. Therefore, the policy variable would refer to a different object in each iteration of the loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const policy of policies.length) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the length property of an array is a number, not a collection of objects. Therefore, the policy variable would be assigned to a number, not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const policy of Object.values(policies)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the Object.values() function returns an array of values of an object, rather than the object itself. Therefore, the policy variable would be assigned to a different value in each iteration of the loop.

DONE.
