  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, and the `if` statement that checks `options` would evaluate to `false`, causing the function to return `null` instead of the expected object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object, and the `if` statement that checks `options` would evaluate to `true`, causing the function to return an empty object instead of the expected object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, and the `if` statement that checks `options` would evaluate to `false`, causing the function to return `undefined` instead of the expected object.

DONE.
