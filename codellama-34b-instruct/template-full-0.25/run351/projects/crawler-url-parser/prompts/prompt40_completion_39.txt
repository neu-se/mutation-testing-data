  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host != null && baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `host` property is `null` and the `baseUrlStr` is truthy, while this replacement checks if the `host` property is not `null` and the `baseUrlStr` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host == baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `host` property is `null` and the `baseUrlStr` is truthy, while this replacement checks if the `host` property is equal to the `baseUrlStr`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host != baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `host` property is `null` and the `baseUrlStr` is truthy, while this replacement checks if the `host`
