 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
a == undefined || a == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `==` operator which performs type coercion, unlike the original `===` which checks for strict equality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
a === void 0 || a === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a way to get the `undefined` value, but it's not exactly the same as checking against the `undefined` variable. This could potentially lead to different behavior if the `undefined` variable has been redefined in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
a === window.undefined || a === null
