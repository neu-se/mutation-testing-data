  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a function that resolves a promise with a value or another promise, whereas `reject` is a function that rejects a promise with a reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("reject")
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` would cause an error to be thrown, whereas `reject` would reject a promise with a reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject("reject")
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject` would create a new rejected promise with the reason "reject", whereas `reject` would reject a promise with the reason "reject".

DONE.
