  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if `a` is an object, while the modified code fragment is checking if `a + 1` is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if `a` is an object, while the modified code fragment is checking if `b` is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if `a` is an object, while the modified code fragment is checking if `a * b` is an object.

DONE.
