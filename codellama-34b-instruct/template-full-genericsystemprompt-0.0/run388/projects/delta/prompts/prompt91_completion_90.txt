  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the `attributes` property of `newOp` to `null`, even if it was previously set to a non-null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the `attributes` property of `newOp` to `undefined`, even if it was previously set to a non-undefined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes !== newOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the `attributes` property of `newOp` to a value that is not equal to its current value, even if it was previously set to a value that is equal to its current value.

DONE.
