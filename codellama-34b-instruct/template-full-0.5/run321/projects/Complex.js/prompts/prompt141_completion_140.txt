  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` checks if a value is not a number, while `isInfinite` checks if a value is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` checks if a value is finite, while `isInfinite` checks if a value is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isZero` checks if a value is zero, while `isInfinite` checks if a value is infinite.

DONE.
