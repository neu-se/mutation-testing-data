  
Alright, let's get started.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
âœ…
```
This would result in different behavior because a boolean value is replaced with a null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because a defined function argument is replaced with a null value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because a resolved promise is replaced with a rejected promise.

DONE.
