  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `countries` array is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if the length of the `countries` array is equal to 0. If the `countries` array is empty, the original code fragment would return `true`, while this new code fragment would return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries.includes(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `countries` array is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if the `countries` array includes the value `undefined`. If the `countries` array includes `undefined`, the original code fragment would return `true`, while this new code fragment would return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries.some(country => country === undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original
