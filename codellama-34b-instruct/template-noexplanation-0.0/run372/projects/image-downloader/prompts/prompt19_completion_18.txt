  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isAbsolute(options.dest)
```
This code fragment is a negation of the original code fragment, which means that it will have the opposite behavior. If the original code fragment was checking if the `options.dest` path is not absolute, then this new code fragment will check if it is absolute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!path.isAbsolute(options.dest)
```
This code fragment is the same as the original code fragment, but with a different operator. The `!` operator is used to negate the result of the `path.isAbsolute()` function, which means that it will have the opposite behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isAbsolute(options.dest) && path.isAbsolute(options.url)
```
This code fragment checks if both the `options.dest` and `options.url` paths are absolute. If either of them is not absolute, then the condition will evaluate
