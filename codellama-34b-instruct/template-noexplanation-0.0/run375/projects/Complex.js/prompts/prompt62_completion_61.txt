  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg']
```
This change will cause the code to use the `arg` property instead of the `phi` property, which may result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['abs']
```
This change will cause the code to use the `abs` property instead of the `phi` property, which may result in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['re']
```
This change will cause the code to use the `re` property instead of the `phi` property, which may result in different behavior.

DONE.
