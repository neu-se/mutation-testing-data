  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, but replacing it with `null` would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, but replacing it with `undefined` would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, but replacing it with an empty function would cause the promise to resolve with `undefined` instead of the expected value.

DONE.
