  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.then()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is not defined on the `inspect` object, so it would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.catch()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch` method is not defined on the `inspect` object, so it would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.finally()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finally` method is not defined on the `inspect` object, so it would throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
