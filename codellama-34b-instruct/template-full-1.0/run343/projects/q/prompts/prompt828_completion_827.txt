  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.onerror` is a function that is called with the error object as its argument, while `null` is a constant that does not have any behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.onerror` is a function that is called with the error object as its argument, while `undefined` is a value that has different behavior than a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { throw E; }
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.onerror` is a function that is called with the error object as its argument, while `function () { throw E; }` is a function that throws an error `E` when called.

DONE.
