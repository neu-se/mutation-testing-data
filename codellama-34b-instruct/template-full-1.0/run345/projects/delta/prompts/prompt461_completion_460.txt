  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[next].slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method returns a new array with all the elements of the original array and the new element, while the `slice` method returns a new array with the selected elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[next].splice()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method removes and returns a specified number of elements from an array, while the `concat` method returns a new array with all the elements of the original array and the new element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[next].pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop` method removes and returns the last element of an array, while the `concat` method returns a new array with all the elements of the original array and the new element.

DONE.
