  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the cosine of `a`, while the mutated code calculates the negative cosine of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the cosine of `a`, while the mutated code calculates the cosine of `a + 1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(a) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the cosine of `a`, while the mutated code calculates the cosine of `a` plus 1.

DONE.
