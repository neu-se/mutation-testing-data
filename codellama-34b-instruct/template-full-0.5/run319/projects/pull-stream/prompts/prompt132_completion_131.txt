  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, i++
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not equal to `null`, so the `if` statement would evaluate to `true` and the function would return `cb(true)` instead of `cb(null, i++)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN, i++
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is not equal to `null`, so the `if` statement would evaluate to `true` and the function would return `cb(true)` instead of `cb(null, i++)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, i++
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is not equal to `null`, so the `if` statement would evaluate to `true` and the function would return `cb(true)` instead of `cb(null, i++)`.

DONE.
