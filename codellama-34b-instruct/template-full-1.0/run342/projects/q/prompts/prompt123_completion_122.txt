  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i in object;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would loop through the indices of the `object` instead of the properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i < object.length; i++;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would loop through the elements of the `object` instead of the properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i < Object.keys(object).length; i++;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would loop through the properties of the `object` in a different order.

DONE.
