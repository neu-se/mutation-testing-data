  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the imaginary part of the complex number instead of the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the sum of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number instead of just the real part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the product of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number instead of just the real part.

DONE.
