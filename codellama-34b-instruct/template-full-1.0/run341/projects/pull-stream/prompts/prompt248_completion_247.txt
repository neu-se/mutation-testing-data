  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort
```
This would result in different behavior because `abort` is a constant that is always truthy, whereas `read` can be either truthy or falsy depending on the context in which it is used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because `read(true)` is a function call that always returns a truthy value, whereas `read` by itself can return either a truthy or falsy value depending on the context in which it is used.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `read(null)` is a function call that always returns null, whereas `read` by itself can return either a truthy or falsy value depending on the context in which it is used.

DONE.
