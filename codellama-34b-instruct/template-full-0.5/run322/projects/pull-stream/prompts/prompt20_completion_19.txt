  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the second argument of the `ref` array instead of the first.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the third argument of the `ref` array instead of the first.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the fourth argument of the `ref` array instead of the first.

DONE.
