  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude and longitude values are swapped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the variable `latitude` is reset to 0, regardless of the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the variable `latitude` is incremented by 1, regardless of the original value.

DONE.
