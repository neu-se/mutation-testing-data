Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(false);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a deferred object that is immediately rejected, rather than one that resolves after the timeout, causing the promise to reject immediately instead of waiting for the specified delay.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a deferred object without any specific resolution or rejection logic, potentially leading to a promise that never resolves or rejects, causing the calling code to hang indefinitely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the deferred object immediately with the value passed in, rather than waiting for the timeout to elapse, which would defeat the purpose of the delay function.

DONE.
