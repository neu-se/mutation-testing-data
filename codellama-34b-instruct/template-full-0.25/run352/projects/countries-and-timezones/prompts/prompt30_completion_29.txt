  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getNumStr(min * -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.abs()` function to ensure that the input to `getNumStr()` is always positive, while this new code fragment would pass a negative value to `getNumStr()`, which could result in a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getNumStr(min + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `min` variable to `getNumStr()`, while this new code fragment passes `min + 1`, which could result in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getNumStr(min - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `min` variable to `getNumStr()`, while this new code fragment passes `min - 1`, which could result in a different output.

DONE.
