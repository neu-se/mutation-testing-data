  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + file
```
This would result in different behavior because `1 + file` would return a different result than `file`, which could cause the test suite to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `file + 1` would return a different result than `file`, which could cause the test suite to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `file - 1` would return a different result than `file`, which could cause the test suite to fail.

DONE.
