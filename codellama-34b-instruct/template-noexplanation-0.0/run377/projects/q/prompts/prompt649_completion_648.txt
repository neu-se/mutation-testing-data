  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, args.slice(1)]
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the `slice` method to remove the first element of the `args` array before passing it to the `post` method. This could potentially cause the `post` method to receive a different set of arguments than it was originally intended to receive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, args.concat(["extra argument"])]
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the `concat` method to add an extra argument to the `args` array before passing it to the `post` method. This could potentially cause the `post` method to receive a different set of arguments than it was originally intended to receive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, args.reverse()]
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the `reverse` method to reverse the
