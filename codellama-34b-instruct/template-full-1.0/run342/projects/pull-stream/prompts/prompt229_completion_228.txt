  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester.test
```
This would result in different behavior because `tester.test` is a function that returns a boolean value indicating whether the input string matches the test pattern, whereas `tester` is a reference to the `tester` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester.test.bind(tester)
```
This would result in different behavior because `tester.test.bind(tester)` creates a new function that is bound to the `tester` object, whereas `tester` is a reference to the `tester` object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester.test.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `tester.test.bind(null)` creates a new function that is bound to the `null` object, whereas `tester` is a reference to the `tester` object itself.

DONE.
