 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the first character of the buffer instead of the length. If the first character is not the start of a valid JSON row, it would trigger a false positive error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.size
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the size of the internal `_data` object instead of the buffer length. This would not detect corrupted rows at the end of the buffer if the `_data` object has been updated but the buffer has not been fully processed yet.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it always triggers an error, even if there is no corrupted row at the end of the buffer. This would cause the `load` event to never be emitted, and the database would not be usable.

DONE.
