  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `options.dest` is falsy, while this code checks if it's specifically null. This could cause a bug if someone sets `options.dest` to something other than null, but still has a falsey value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!options.dest && options.dest !== "path/to/file"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `options.dest` is falsy, while this code checks if `options.dest` is falsy and also not equal to a specific string. This could cause a bug if someone sets `options.dest` to a non-null value, but still wants the code to behave as if it were null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof options.dest !== "string"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `options.
