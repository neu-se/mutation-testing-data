  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `cos` is a trigonometric function that computes the cosine of an angle, whereas `cosh` computes the hyperbolic cosine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin` is a trigonometric function that computes the sine of an angle, whereas `cosh` computes the hyperbolic cosine.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `sqrt` computes the square root of a number, whereas `cosh` computes the hyperbolic cosine.

DONE.
