  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the comma operator, which evaluates both operands and returns the second one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the comma operator, which evaluates both operands and returns the second one. However, `a / b` would return a different value than the original code if `a` and `b` are not both `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a * b` would return a different value than the original code if `a` and `b` are not both `0`.

DONE.
