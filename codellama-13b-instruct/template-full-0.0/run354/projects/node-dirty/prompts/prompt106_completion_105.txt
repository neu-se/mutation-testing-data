  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value stored at the key would be incremented by 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value stored at the key would be decremented by 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value stored at the key would be multiplied by 2.

DONE.
