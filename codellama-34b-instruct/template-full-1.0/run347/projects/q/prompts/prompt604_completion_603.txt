This would result in different behavior because the original code used ${deferred}.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: "hub".
This would result in different behavior because the original code only used ${deferred}.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: "callback".
This would result in different behavior because the original code only used ${deferred}.

DONE.
