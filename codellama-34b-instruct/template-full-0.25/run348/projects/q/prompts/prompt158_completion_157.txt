  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.stack = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stack` property of the `error` object would be set to `null`, which would prevent the `makeStackTraceLong` function from modifying the stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.stack = "foo";
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stack` property of the `error` object would be set to the string "foo", which would cause the `makeStackTraceLong` function to concatenate the string "foo" with the stack trace of the `promise` object, rather than the original stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.stack = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stack` property of the `error` object would be set to `undefined`, which would cause the `makeStackTraceLong` function to use the original stack trace, rather than the modified stack trace.

DONE.
