  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseFloat(tokens[i + 1])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to attempt to parse the next token as a float, which could result in an error if the next token is not a valid number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to use the next token as a string, rather than attempting to parse it as a float.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to multiply the next token by 2 before using it as a string.

DONE.
