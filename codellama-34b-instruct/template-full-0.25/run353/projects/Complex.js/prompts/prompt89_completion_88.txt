  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseInt
```
This would result in different behavior because `parseInt` would return the integer part of the string, while `parseFloat` returns the floating-point number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number` would return a number object, while `parseFloat` returns a primitive number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` would return the largest integer less than or equal to the given number, while `parseFloat` returns the floating-point number.

DONE.
