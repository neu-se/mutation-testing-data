  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('die', 'dice')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a new rule to the `rules` array, while this code fragment would replace the existing rule for the word "die" with a new one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('die', 'dies')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a new rule to the `rules` array, while this code fragment would replace the existing rule for the word "die" with a new one that has a different plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('die', function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a new rule to the `rules` array, while this code fragment would replace the existing rule for the word "die" with a new one that uses a different function to generate the plural form.
