  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.search.split('&')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the search query string on '&' characters, but this new code fragment splits it on '|' characters, which could result in different query parameters being extracted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.search.split('?')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the search query string on '&' characters, but this new code fragment splits it on '?' characters, which could result in different query parameters being extracted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.search.split('=')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the search query string on '&' characters, but this new code fragment splits it on '=' characters, which could result in different query parameters being extracted.

DONE.
