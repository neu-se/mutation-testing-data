  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, generate())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls `cb` if `end` is truthy, but this new code fragment calls `cb` regardless of the value of `end`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, generate() + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment generates a random number and passes it to `cb`, but this new code fragment generates a random number, adds 1 to it, and passes the result to `cb`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, generate() * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment generates a random number and passes it to `cb`, but this new code fragment generates a random number, multiplies it by 2, and passes the result to `cb`.

DONE.
