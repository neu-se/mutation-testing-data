Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data.toString(), options? options.reviver : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method is called on the `data` variable, which could potentially alter its value if it's not already a string, leading to different parsing results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data, options? options.reviver : undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is used instead of `null` as the default value for the reviver function, which could lead to different behavior in the `JSON.parse()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data.slice(1), options? options.reviver : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice(1)` method is called on the `data` variable, which removes the first character from the string, potentially leading to different parsing results or errors if the JSON data is malformed.

DONE.
