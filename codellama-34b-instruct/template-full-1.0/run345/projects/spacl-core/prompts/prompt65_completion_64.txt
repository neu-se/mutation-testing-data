  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...rules.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` method will create a shallow copy of the array, whereas the original code fragment will append the new rules to the existing array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...rules.concat([new Rule()])
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat()` method will create a new array with the new rule appended to it, whereas the original code fragment will mutate the existing array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...rules.push(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `push()` method will add `undefined` to the existing array, whereas the original code fragment will add the new rule to the array.

DONE.
