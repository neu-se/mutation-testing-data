  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!urlMap.has
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return true if the key is not present in the map, whereas the original code fragment returns true if the key is present.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.size
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the number of key-value pairs in the map, whereas the original code fragment returns a boolean value indicating whether the key is present or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.get(currentUrl.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value associated with the key `currentUrl.url`, whereas the original code fragment returns a boolean value indicating whether the key is present or not.

DONE.
