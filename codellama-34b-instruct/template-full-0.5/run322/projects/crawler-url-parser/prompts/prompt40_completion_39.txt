  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host === null && baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, including the type of the operands, whereas the `==` operator only checks for equality. In this case, `parsedUrl.host` is a string, and `baseUrlStr` is a string, so using `===` would ensure that the types are the same as well as the values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host !== null && baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, including the type of the operands, whereas the `!=` operator only checks for inequality. In this case, `parsedUrl.host` is a string, and `baseUrlStr` is a string, so using `!==` would ensure that the types are not the same as well as the values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
