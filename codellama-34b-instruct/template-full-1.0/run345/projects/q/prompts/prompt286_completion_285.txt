  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof resolver !== !"function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the result of the `typeof` operator, making the condition pass even if `resolver` is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof resolver === void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `void` keyword returns `undefined`, so the condition will pass if `resolver` is `undefined` or unassigned, regardless of its type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof resolver !== "function" || !resolver
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!resolver` expression would be `true` if `resolver` is falsy, which would cause the condition to pass even if `resolver` is a function.

DONE.
