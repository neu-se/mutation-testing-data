  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fail
```
This would result in different behavior because `fail` is a method that rejects the promise with the given reason, whereas `fapply` is a method that applies the given arguments to the promise and returns a new promise for the result. Using `fail` instead of `fapply` would cause the promise to be rejected immediately, which would result in different behavior.

DONE.
