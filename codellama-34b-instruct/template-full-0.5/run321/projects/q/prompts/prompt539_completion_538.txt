  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.all(array)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.all` expects an array of promises, while the original code fragment expects an array of values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(array)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve` returns a promise that is resolved with the provided value, while the original code fragment returns a promise that is resolved with the array of values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(array)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject` returns a promise that is rejected with the provided reason, while the original code fragment returns a promise that is resolved with the array of values.

DONE.
