Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would reference the wrong operation, potentially leading to confusion when debugging.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
link.getPath()
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would include the actual path of the link instead of the operation name, which could be more informative but also potentially reveal sensitive information.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be missing the operation name, which could make it harder to diagnose the issue, as the error message would only contain the filename.

DONE.
