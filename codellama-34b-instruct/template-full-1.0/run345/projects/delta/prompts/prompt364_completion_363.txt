  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekType` method returns the type of the next operation, which can be either `'insert'`, `'delete'`, or `'retain'`. If the placeholder is replaced with `-1`, the `peekType` method will return `undefined`, which will cause the loop to terminate prematurely, potentially skipping over some operations in the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekType` method returns the type of the next operation, which can be either `'insert'`, `'delete'`, or `'retain'`. If the placeholder is replaced with an empty array, the `peekType` method will return `undefined`, which will cause the loop to terminate prematurely, potentially skipping over some operations in the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the
