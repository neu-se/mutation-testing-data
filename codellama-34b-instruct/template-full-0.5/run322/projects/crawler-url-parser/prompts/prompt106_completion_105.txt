  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.add
```
This would result in different behavior because `add` is a method that adds a new element to the end of a Map, while `set` is a method that sets the value of an element in a Map. If the `add` method is used instead of `set`, the `urlMap` will contain duplicate entries for the same URL, which may not be desirable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a method that removes an element from a Map, while `set` is a method that sets the value of an element in a Map. If the `delete` method is used instead of `set`, the `urlMap` will not contain the URL that was just added, which may not be desirable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.clear
```
This would result in different behavior because `clear` is a method that removes all elements from a
