  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `/` character to split the path into components, while the new code uses the `\` character, which would result in different path components.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `/` character to split the path into components, while the new code uses a space character, which would result in different path components.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `/` character to split the path into components, while the new code uses a different character, which would result in different path components.

DONE.
