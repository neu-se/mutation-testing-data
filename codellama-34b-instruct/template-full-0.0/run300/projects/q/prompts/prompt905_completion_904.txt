  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(0)` creates a shallow copy of the `nodeArgs` array, which would cause the `fail` method to be called with a different object than the one that was passed to the `nfcall` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.concat([])
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat([])` creates a new array that is a concatenation of `nodeArgs` and an empty array, which would cause the `fail` method to be called with a different object than the one that was passed to the `nfcall` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.map(function(x) { return x; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `map` creates a new array that is a projection of `nodeArgs` using the provided function, which would cause the `fail` method to be called
