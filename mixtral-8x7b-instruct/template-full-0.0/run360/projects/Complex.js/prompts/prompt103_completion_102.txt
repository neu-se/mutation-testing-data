 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would ignore the `minus` variable, causing the code to behave differently when the input string starts with a '-' character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to true, causing the code to skip the final check and potentially return an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus >= 10
```
This would result in different behavior because it would require a much larger input string to trigger the final check, potentially causing the code to return an incorrect result for valid inputs.

DONE.
