  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiverOptions || { gzip: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always enable gzip compression, even if the `archiverOptions` object does not specify it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiverOptions || { zlib: { level: 9 } }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the zlib compression level to 9, even if the `archiverOptions` object does not specify it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiverOptions || { store: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the `store` method for compression, even if the `archiverOptions` object specifies a different method.

DONE.
