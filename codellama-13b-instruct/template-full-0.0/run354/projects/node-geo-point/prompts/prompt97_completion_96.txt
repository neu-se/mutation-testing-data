  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `y` variable is used in the calculation of the latitude, and adding 1 to it would change the latitude by a small amount.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `y` variable is used in the calculation of the latitude, and subtracting 1 from it would change the latitude by a small amount.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `y` variable is used in the calculation of the latitude, and multiplying it by 2 would change the latitude by a larger amount.

DONE.
