  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val == null
```
This would result in different behavior because `val == null` would also match `null` and `undefined`, whereas `val === undefined` only matches `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof val === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof val === 'undefined'` would also match `undefined` and `null`, whereas `val === undefined` only matches `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val === void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `val === void 0` would only match `undefined`, whereas `val === undefined` would also match `null`.

DONE.
