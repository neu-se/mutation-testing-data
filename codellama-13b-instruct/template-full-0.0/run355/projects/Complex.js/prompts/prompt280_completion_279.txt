  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a constant, while the modified code fragment is a constant plus one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a constant, while the modified code fragment is a constant minus one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a constant, while the modified code fragment is a constant multiplied by two.

DONE.
