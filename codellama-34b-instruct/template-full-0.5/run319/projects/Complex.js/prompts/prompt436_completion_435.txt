  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places && 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `places && 0` would always evaluate to `0`, whereas `places || 0` would evaluate to `places` if it is a truthy value, and `0` otherwise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places ^ 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `places ^ 0` would always evaluate to `places`, whereas `places || 0` would evaluate to `0` if `places` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places ? 0 : 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `places ? 0 : 1` would always evaluate to `0` if `places` is truthy, and `1` otherwise, whereas `places || 0` would evaluate to `places` if it is truthy, and `0` otherwise.
