  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continueCb;
```
This would result in different behavior because `continueCb` is not a valid function, so the code would throw an error if it were used in place of `abortCb`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null;
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, so the code would throw an error if it were used in place of `abortCb`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `abortCb` function with the `cb` parameter set to `null`, which would result in an infinite loop.

DONE.
