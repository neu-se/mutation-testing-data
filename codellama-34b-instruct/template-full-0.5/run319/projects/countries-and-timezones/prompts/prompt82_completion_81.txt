  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(c) => getTimezone(c, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getTimezone` function instead of the `getCountry` function, which would return a different object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(c) => getCountry(c.id, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getCountry` function with the `id` property of the `c` object instead of the `c` object itself, which could return a different country.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(c) => getCountry(c.name, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getCountry` function with the `name` property of the `c` object instead of the `c` object itself, which could return a different country.

DONE.
