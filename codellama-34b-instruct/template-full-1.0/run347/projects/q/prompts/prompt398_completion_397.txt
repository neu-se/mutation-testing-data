  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `value` may be a non-zero number, and 0 in the `thenResolve()` method would cause the promise to resolve with a value of 0 instead of the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `value` may be a non-null value, and null in the `thenResolve()` method would cause the promise to resolve with a value of null instead of the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `value` may be a defined value, and undefined in the `thenResolve()` method would cause the promise to resolve with no value instead of the original value.

DONE.
