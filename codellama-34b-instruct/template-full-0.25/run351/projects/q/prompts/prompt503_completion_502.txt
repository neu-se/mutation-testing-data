  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value and `void 0` is a keyword that evaluates to `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value and `void 0` is a keyword that evaluates to `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args, null
```
This would result in different behavior because `args` is an array of arguments passed to the `post` method, and `null` is a primitive value.

DONE.
