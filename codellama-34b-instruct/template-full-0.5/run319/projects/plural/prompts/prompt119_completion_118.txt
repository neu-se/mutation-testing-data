  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ic$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `s` at the end of the word would not be matched.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ic\b/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the word boundary assertion would not be matched.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ic(?!s)/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative lookahead assertion would not be matched.

DONE.
