  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `currentUrlStr` is a string, and `null` is an object. In JavaScript, objects and strings are not equal, even if they have the same content.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `currentUrlStr` is a string, and `length` is a property that returns the number of characters in the string. If the string is empty, its length is 0, and the condition would evaluate to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.trim() === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because `trim()` is a method that removes whitespace from the beginning and end of a string. If the string is empty or contains only whitespace, `trim()` would return an empty string, and the condition would evaluate to `true`.

DONE.
