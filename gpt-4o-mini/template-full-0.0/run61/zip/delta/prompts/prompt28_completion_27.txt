Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of the object's own enumerable property values, rather than the keys, which would cause the `reduce` function to iterate over values instead of keys, leading to incorrect behavior in the `invert` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(base).filter(key => key.startsWith('a'))
```
This would result in different behavior because filtering the keys to only those that start with 'a' would limit the keys considered in the `invert` function, potentially omitting relevant keys and leading to incomplete results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries(base)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries` returns an array of key-value pairs, which would not work with the `reduce` method as intended, causing the logic to fail since it expects an array of keys to iterate over.

DONE.
