  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filterNot
```
This would result in different behavior because `filterNot` is a different function than `filter`, and it would cause the code to return the opposite of what the original code intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filterNot(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `filterNot(data)` is a different function call than `filter(data)`, and it would cause the code to return the opposite of what the original code intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!filter(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `!filter(data)` is a different logical operation than `filter(data)`, and it would cause the code to return the opposite of what the original code intended.

DONE.
