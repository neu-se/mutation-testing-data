  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return index - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `transformPosition` method would return the wrong index, potentially causing the `transform` method to fail or produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return index + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `transformPosition` method would return the wrong index, potentially causing the `transform` method to fail or produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return index * 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `transformPosition` method would return a different index, potentially causing the `transform` method to fail or produce incorrect results.

DONE.
