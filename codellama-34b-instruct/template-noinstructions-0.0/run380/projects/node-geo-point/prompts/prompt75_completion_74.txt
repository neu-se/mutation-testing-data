  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Number()` function would not be applied to the `bearing` variable, which could cause issues if the `bearing` variable is not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bearing` variable would be incremented by 1, which could cause the `calculateDestination` function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bearing` variable would be multiplied by 2, which could cause the `calculateDestination` function to return a different result.

DONE.
