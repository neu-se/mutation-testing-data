  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w === 'dwarf' || w === 'floor'
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment would always return `true` for the word "floor", regardless of whether it is a valid exception word or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w === 'dwarf' || w === 'roof' && w !== 'dwarf'
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment would always return `false` for the word "roof", regardless of whether it is a valid exception word or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w === 'dwarf' || w === 'roof' && w !== 'floor'
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment would always return `true` for the word "roof", regardless of whether it is a valid exception word or not.

DONE.
