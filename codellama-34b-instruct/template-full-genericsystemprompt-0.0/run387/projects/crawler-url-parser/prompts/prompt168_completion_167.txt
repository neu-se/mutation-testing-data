  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the link URL path includes the page URL path, which is the opposite of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the link URL path starts with the page URL path, which is different from the original code that checks if the link URL path includes the page URL path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.endsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the link URL path ends with the page URL path, which is different from the original code that checks if the link URL path includes the page URL path.

DONE.
