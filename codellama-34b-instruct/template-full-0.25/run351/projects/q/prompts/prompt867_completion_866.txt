  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deferred.reject(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` method is called with the value of the promise, which would cause the promise to be rejected with that value, rather than resolved with it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deferred.resolve(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` method is called with the error object, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the error object, rather than rejected with it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deferred.notify(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify` method is called with the error object, which would cause the promise to be notified with the error object, rather than rejected with it.

DONE.
