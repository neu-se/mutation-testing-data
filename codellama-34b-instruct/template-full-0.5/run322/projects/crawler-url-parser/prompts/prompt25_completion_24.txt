  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removed the fragment identifier from the URL, while the new code fragment would leave it intact.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#' + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removed the fragment identifier from the URL, while the new code fragment would add a new fragment identifier with the value "foo".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#' + parseInt(currentUrlStr, 16)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removed the fragment identifier from the URL, while the new code fragment would add a new fragment identifier with a value that is the result of parsing the current URL string as a hexadecimal number.

DONE.
