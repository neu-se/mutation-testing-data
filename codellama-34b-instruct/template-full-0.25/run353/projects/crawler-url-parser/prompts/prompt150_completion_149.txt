  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\/"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a regular expression that matches a forward slash, while the new code fragment is a string that matches a backslash followed by a forward slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"/"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a regular expression that matches a forward slash, while the new code fragment is a string that matches a forward slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\\\/"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a regular expression that matches a forward slash, while the new code fragment is a string that matches a backslash followed by a forward slash.

DONE.
