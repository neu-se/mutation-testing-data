  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-y
```
This would result in different behavior because the unary minus operator changes the sign of the value, which would cause the bearing calculation to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y+1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of y is increased by 1, which would cause the bearing calculation to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y*2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of y is doubled, which would cause the bearing calculation to be incorrect.

DONE.
