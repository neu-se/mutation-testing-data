  DONE.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const x
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable `x` is not defined in the current scope, so it would throw a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = 'allow'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `verb` variable would always be `'allow'`, regardless of the actual verb that is passed to the `query` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const otherVerbs = Object.keys(this.verbs)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `otherVerbs` variable would contain all the other verbs that are defined in the `verbs` object, even if they are not specifically allowed or denied by the current rule.
