  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] === 'j' || tokens[i + 1] === 'J'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking for the presence of the letter "j" or "J" instead of "i" or "I", which would cause the parser to behave differently for inputs containing those letters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] === 'i' || tokens[i + 1] === 'I' || tokens[i + 1] === 'j' || tokens[i + 1] === 'J'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking for the presence of the letter "i", "I", "j", or "J" instead of just "i" or "I", which would cause the parser to behave differently for inputs containing those letters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
