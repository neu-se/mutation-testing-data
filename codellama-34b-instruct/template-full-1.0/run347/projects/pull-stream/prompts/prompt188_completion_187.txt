  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i--]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the last element of the array instead of the next one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the next element of the array instead of the current one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[Math.floor(Math.random() * array.length)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a random element from the array instead of the next one.

DONE.
