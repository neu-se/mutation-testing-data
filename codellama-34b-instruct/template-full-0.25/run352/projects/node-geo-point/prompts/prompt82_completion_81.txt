  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ2 = sinφ1⋅cosδ + cosφ1⋅sinδ⋅cosθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function is not defined in the code snippet, and the `sinφ2` variable is used later in the code to calculate the destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ2 = sinφ1⋅cosδ + cosφ1⋅sinδ⋅cosθ + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` term would change the result of the calculation, potentially leading to a different destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ2 = sinφ1⋅cosδ + cosφ1⋅sinδ⋅cosθ + 0.5
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 0.5` term would change the result of the calculation, potentially leading to a different destination point.

DONE.
