  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.toTile(this, zoom + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a tile with a different zoom level than the original code, which could cause issues with the application's functionality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.toTile(this, zoom - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a tile with a lower zoom level than the original code, which could cause issues with the application's functionality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.toTile(this, zoom + 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a tile with a higher zoom level than the original code, which could cause issues with the application's functionality.

DONE.
