  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` function would be called instead of the `nodeback` function, which could cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).then(deferred.resolve);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` function would be called instead of the `nodeback` function, which could cause the promise to be resolved instead of rejected.
