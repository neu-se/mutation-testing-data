  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[a-z]+\/[0-9]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was matching any sequence of characters followed by a forward slash and one or more digits at the end of the string, while the new code fragment matches any sequence of lowercase letters followed by a forward slash and one or more digits at the end of the string. This change will not affect the behavior of the code for URLs that have only uppercase letters in the protocol or domain name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\([a-z]\)[0-9]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was matching any sequence of characters followed by a forward slash and one or more digits at the end of the string, while the new code fragment matches any sequence of letters or numbers followed by a forward slash and one or more digits at the end of the string. This change will not affect the behavior of the code for URLs that have only uppercase letters in the protocol or domain name.
