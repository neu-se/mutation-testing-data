  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Something went wrong"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with an error message, instead of being resolved with a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(new Error("Something went wrong"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be notified with an error message, instead of being resolved with a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(Q(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with a new promise, instead of being resolved with the original value.

DONE.
