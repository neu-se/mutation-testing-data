  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isAbsolute(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `options.dest` is not absolute, while this replacement checks if it is absolute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!path.isAbsolute(options.dest) && path.isAbsolute(options.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `options.dest` is not absolute, while this replacement checks if both `options.dest` and `options.url` are not absolute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isAbsolute(options.dest) || path.isAbsolute(options.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `options.dest` is not absolute, while this replacement checks if either `options.dest` or `options.url` is absolute.

DONE.
