 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.getOwnPropertyNames
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.getOwnPropertyNames` returns only the own enumerable and non-enumerable properties of an object, while `Object.keys` returns only the enumerable properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Reflect.ownKeys
