  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let <variable> = descriptor[op](args);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the function stored in the `op` property of the `descriptor` object, which may not be the same as the `apply` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let <variable> = descriptor[op];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the function stored in the `op` property of the `descriptor` object to a new variable, instead of calling it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let <variable> = descriptor[op] && descriptor[op].apply(this, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only call the `apply` method if the `op` property of the `descriptor` object is not null or undefined.

DONE.
