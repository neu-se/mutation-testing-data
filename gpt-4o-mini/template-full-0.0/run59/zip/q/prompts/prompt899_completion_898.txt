Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of creating a Node-style resolver that handles the callback, it directly resolves the promise, which would lead to the promise being resolved immediately without waiting for the Node-style callback to be invoked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately reject the promise instead of setting up a resolver, causing any subsequent success callbacks to be bypassed and resulting in an error state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver.bind(deferred)()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invoke the `makeNodeResolver` method in a different context, potentially leading to unexpected behavior if `makeNodeResolver` relies on the context of `deferred` being the correct one.

DONE.
