 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.transform(thisData[embedType], otherData[embedType], !priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `priority` value is being flipped, causing the `transform` method to behave differently when handling the embedded operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.invert(thisData[embedType], otherData[embedType])
