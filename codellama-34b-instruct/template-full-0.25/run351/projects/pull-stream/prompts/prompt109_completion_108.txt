  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc + data
```
This would result in different behavior because `acc + data` would always return a new value, whereas `reducer` could potentially return a reference to an existing object, which could cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc - data
```
This would result in different behavior because `acc - data` would always return a new value, whereas `reducer` could potentially return a reference to an existing object, which could cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc * data
```
This would result in different behavior because `acc * data` would always return a new value, whereas `reducer` could potentially return a reference to an existing object, which could cause the test to fail.

DONE.
