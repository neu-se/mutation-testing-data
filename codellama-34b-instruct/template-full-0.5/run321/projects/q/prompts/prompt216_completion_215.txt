  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a rejected promise instead of a resolved one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(value).then(function (result) {
    return result + 1;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the result of the promise before returning it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(value).catch(function (error) {
    throw new Error("Something went wrong");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would catch any errors and throw a new error with a different message.

DONE.
