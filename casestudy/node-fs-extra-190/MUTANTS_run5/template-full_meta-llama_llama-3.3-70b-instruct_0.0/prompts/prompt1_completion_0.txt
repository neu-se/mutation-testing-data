Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.existsSync(srcFile)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the existence of the source file instead of the destination file, potentially leading to incorrect handling of file copying.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!fs.existsSync(destFile)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the non-existence of the destination file, which is the opposite of the original behavior, potentially leading to overwriting of existing files without warning.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.existsSync(destFile) && clobber
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks for the existence of the destination file when clobber is true, potentially leading to inconsistent handling of file overwriting.

DONE.
