  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the return statement would be skipped, and the function would not return any value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the return statement would return `null`, which would be different from the original `abort` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the return statement would return `false`, which would be different from the original `abort` value.

DONE.
