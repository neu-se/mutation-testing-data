  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` and `Math.cos` have different implementations, and using `Math.sin` instead of `Math.cos` would cause the `tan` function to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan` and `Math.cos` have different implementations, and using `Math.tan` instead of `Math.cos` would cause the `tan` function to produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.acos` and `Math.cos` have different implementations, and using `Math.acos` instead of `Math.cos` would cause the `tan` function to produce incorrect results.

DONE.
