  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"!="
```
This change will cause the `split` method to split the string at every character that is not equal to "=", rather than at every occurrence of "=".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"=="
```
This change will cause the `split` method to split the string at every character that is equal to "=", rather than at every occurrence of "=".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"<>"
```
This change will cause the `split` method to split the string at every character that is not equal to "=", rather than at every occurrence of "=".

DONE.
