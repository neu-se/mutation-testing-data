  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because `value.state` would be compared to the string "fulfilled", which would always be false, even if the promise is fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.state !== "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because `value.state` would be compared to the string "fulfilled", which would always be true, even if the promise is rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.state !== "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because `value.state` would be compared to the string "rejected", which would always be true, even if the promise is fulfilled.

DONE.
