  option 1 out of three) The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with :

1. The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0;

```
This would cause a division by zero error in the next line, which would result in the mutation failing the test.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength + 1;
```
This would result in an incorrect value being assigned to the opLength variable. This would cause the code to execute the if block, try to take the length of an op object that is undefined and would result in an error.

Option3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength -1;
```
This would result in the same type of error as option 1 but with a different error message.
