  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('bacterium', 'bacterias')
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "bacterias" is not a recognized plural form of "bacterium". The code would still function, but the output would not be correct.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('bacterium', 'bacteria')
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "bacteria" is not a recognized plural form of "bacterium". The code would still function, but the output would not be correct.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('bacterium', 'bacteriums')
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "bacteriums" is not a recognized plural form of "bacterium". The code would still function, but the output would not be correct.

DONE.
