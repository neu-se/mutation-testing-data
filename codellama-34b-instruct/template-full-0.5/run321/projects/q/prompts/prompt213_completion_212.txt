  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `value` is a promise-like object, while this replacement only checks if `value` is not null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `value` is a promise-like object, while this replacement only checks if `value` is not undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof value === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `value` is a promise-like object, while this replacement only checks if `value` is an object.

DONE.
