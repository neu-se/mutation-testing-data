  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty.call(object, 'longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` method is being called on the `object` itself, rather than being called on the `Object.prototype` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(object, 'longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` method is being called on the `Object.prototype` object, rather than being called on the `object` itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty('longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` method is being called with a string argument, rather than being called with a symbol argument.

DONE.
