Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return index + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it always increments the index by 1, potentially skipping over characters that should be retained or transformed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return index - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it decrements the index, which could lead to incorrect positioning when transforming the Delta, causing data to be lost or misaligned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return index * 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the index by 2, which would incorrectly position the transformation, likely resulting in an out-of-bounds error or incorrect data manipulation.

DONE.
