  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`!err`
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the error, causing the `next()` function to be called with a null `err` argument, even if an error occurred during the mapping process.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`err && err.message === 'something'`
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only call the `next()` function if the error is of a specific type and has a specific message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`err.code === 404`
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only call the `next()` function if the error is of a specific type and has a specific code.

DONE.
