  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `task` function would not be called, and the `laterQueue` would not be processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `task` function would not be called, and the `laterQueue` would not be processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `task` function would be called with an empty function, and the `laterQueue` would not be processed.

DONE.
