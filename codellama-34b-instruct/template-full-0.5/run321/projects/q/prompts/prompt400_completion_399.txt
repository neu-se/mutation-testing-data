  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value and does not have a `then` method, whereas `promise` is an object that has a `then` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value and does not have a `then` method, whereas `promise` is an object that has a `then` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an object that does not have a `then` method, whereas `promise` is an object that has a `then` method.

DONE.
