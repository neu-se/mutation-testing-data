  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler(embedType)
```
This would result in different behavior because `getHandler` is a function that returns a handler object for a given embed type, but the returned object is not used in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler(embedType).transform
```
This would result in different behavior because `transform` is a function that takes two arguments, but the original code only passes one argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler(embedType).transform(1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `transform` is a function that takes two arguments, but the original code passes only one argument.

DONE.
