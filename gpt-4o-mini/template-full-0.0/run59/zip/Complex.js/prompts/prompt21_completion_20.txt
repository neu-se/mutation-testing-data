Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(a * a + b * b, 1/3)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the cube root of the sum of squares instead of the square root, which would lead to incorrect results in calculations that expect the hypotenuse of a right triangle.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(a * a + b * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the absolute value of the sum of squares, which does not compute the hypotenuse and can lead to incorrect results when negative values are involved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a * a - b * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly subtracts the square of `b` from the square of `a`, which can yield a negative result under certain conditions, leading to NaN (Not a Number) when trying to compute the square root of a negative number.

DONE.
