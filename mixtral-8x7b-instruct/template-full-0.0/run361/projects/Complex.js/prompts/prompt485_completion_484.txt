 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof module.exports === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the existence of `module.exports` instead of `exports`. This could cause issues if the developer was using the `module.exports` syntax instead of the `exports` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `exports` object is not defined, which would be true in a CommonJS environment but not in other environments such as the browser. This could cause the code to break in non-CommonJS environments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it always evaluates to `true`, regardless of the environment. This could cause unintended side effects if the code relies on the original condition being `false` in certain situations.

DONE.
