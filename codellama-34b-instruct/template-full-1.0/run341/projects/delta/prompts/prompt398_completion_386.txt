  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-otherOp
```
This would result in different behavior because the unary `-` operator changes the sign of `otherOp`, potentially leading to different results in further calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `0` value is a falsey value, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate as false even if `otherOp` was originally truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because `Infinity` is a numeric value that is greater than any other number, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate as true even if `otherOp` was originally falsey.

DONE.
