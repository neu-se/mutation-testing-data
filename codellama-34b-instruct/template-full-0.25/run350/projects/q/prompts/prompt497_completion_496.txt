  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trackRejection` function would be called with `null` as the `reason` argument, which would not be tracked as an unhandled rejection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trackRejection` function would be called with `undefined` as the `reason` argument, which would not be tracked as an unhandled rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trackRejection` function would be called with a new `Error` object as the `reason` argument, which would be tracked as an unhandled rejection.

DONE.
