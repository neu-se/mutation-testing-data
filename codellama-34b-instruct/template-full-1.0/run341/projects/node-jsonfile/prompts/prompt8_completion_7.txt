  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because `stripBom` is called on the original data, but `trim` is called on the stripped data. This could lead to different results if the data contains leading or trailing whitespace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.replace(/^\s+|\s+$/g, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because `stripBom` is called on the original data, but regular expression substitution is used to remove leading and trailing whitespace. This could lead to different results if the data contains non-whitespace characters that are not included in the regular expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.match(/^\s+|\s+$/)
```
This would result in different behavior because `stripBom` is called on the original data, but regular expression matching is used to find leading and trailing whitespace. This could lead to different results if the data contains non-whitespace characters that are
