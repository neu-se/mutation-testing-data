  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the original value of `a` for the calculation, while replacing `a` with `0` would cause the calculation to always result in `0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the original value of `a` for the calculation, while replacing `a` with `a + 1` would cause the calculation to always result in a different value than `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the original value of `a` for the calculation, while replacing `a` with `a * Math.random()` would cause the calculation to produce a different result each time it is called.

DONE.
