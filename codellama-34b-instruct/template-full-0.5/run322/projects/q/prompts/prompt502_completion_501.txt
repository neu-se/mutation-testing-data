  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be adding 1 to the arguments instead of using them as is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be using the first argument instead of all of them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be using the length of the arguments instead of the arguments themselves.

DONE.
