  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.min
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.min` returns the smallest of its two arguments, while `Math.cos` returns the cosine of its argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` returns the sine of its argument, while `Math.cos` returns the cosine of its argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan` returns the tangent of its argument, while `Math.cos` returns the cosine of its argument.

DONE.
