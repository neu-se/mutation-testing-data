  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a promise that resolves with the value of `object`, while the new code fragment is a promise that resolves with an empty array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a promise that resolves with the value of `object`, while the new code fragment is a promise that resolves with `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a promise that resolves with the value of `object`, while the new code fragment is a promise that resolves with `undefined`.

DONE.
