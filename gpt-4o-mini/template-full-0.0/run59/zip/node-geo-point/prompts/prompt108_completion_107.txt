Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increase the zoom level by 1, potentially resulting in a different tile being calculated than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the zoom level, which could lead to a significantly different tile calculation, possibly resulting in an incorrect tile being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrease the zoom level by 1, which may lead to a less detailed tile being calculated than what was originally intended.

DONE.
