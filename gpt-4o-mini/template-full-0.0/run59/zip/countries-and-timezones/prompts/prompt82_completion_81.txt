Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(c) => getCountry(c)
```
This would result in different behavior because it omits the `options` parameter, potentially leading to incorrect or unexpected results when the function relies on options for filtering or modifying the output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(c) => getTimezone(c, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly calls `getTimezone` instead of `getCountry`, which would return timezone data instead of country data, leading to a mismatch in expected output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(c) => getCountry(c, { deprecated: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the `options` parameter to always include `deprecated: true`, which may alter the output by including deprecated countries that would otherwise be excluded.

DONE.
