  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === false
```
This would result in different behavior because `abort` is always truthy, so the function would always return `abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)`, even when no abort has been triggered.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because `!abort` would invert the logic, making the function return `abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)` regardless of whether an abort has been triggered.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.length === 0` would check if the array is empty, but it would not check if an abort has been triggered.

DONE.
