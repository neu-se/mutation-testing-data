  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` property of the `newOp` object would be set to `null`, which would cause the `insert` method to return `this` instead of the expected `this.push(newOp)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` property of the `newOp` object would be set to `undefined`, which would cause the `insert` method to return `this` instead of the expected `this.push(newOp)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = 'foo';
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` property of the `newOp` object would be set to the string `'foo'`, which would cause the `insert` method to return `this.push(newOp)` with a different value for the `insert` property.
