  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this._writeStream.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because `end()` is a method that closes the stream and causes all future write() calls to fail. Therefore, if `end()` is used in place of `destroy()`, any pending writes will not be executed, which may result in data loss.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this._writeStream.destroy(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `true` to `destroy()` forces the stream to close, which means that any pending writes will not be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this._writeStream.destroySoon()
```
This would result in different behavior because `destroySoon()` is similar to `destroy()`, but it waits for all pending writes to be completed before closing the stream. This may result in different behavior if there are pending writes that need to be executed before the stream is closed.

DONE.
