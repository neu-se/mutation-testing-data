  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `this._data.get` is a getter function that returns the value of the `this._data` property, while the new code fragment `this._data.get()` is a function call that returns the value of the `this._data` property and then invokes the `get` method on it. This could potentially cause different behavior in the code, depending on the implementation of the `get` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `this._data.get` is a getter function that returns the value of the `this._data` property, while the new code fragment `this._data.get.call(this)` is a function call that returns the value of the `this._data` property and then invokes the `get` method on it, but with the `this` context set to the current object
