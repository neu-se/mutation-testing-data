  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had `become(reject(reason));`, which would have called the `reject` function with the `reason` argument, whereas the new code fragment would have called the `reject` function with no arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.fulfill(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had `become(fulfill(value));`, which would have called the `fulfill` function with the `value` argument, whereas the new code fragment would have called the `fulfill` function with no arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(progress);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had `array_reduce(progressListeners, function (undefined, progressListener) { Q.nextTick(function () { progressListener(progress); });
