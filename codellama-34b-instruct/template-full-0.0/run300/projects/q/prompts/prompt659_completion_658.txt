  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a different array, with only the first argument instead of the first two.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a different array, with only the first three arguments instead of the first two.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[], 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a different array, with only the second argument instead of the first two.

DONE.
