  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` is a more general check that returns `true` for any object with a `then` method, while `isPromise` only returns `true` for instances of the `Promise` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFulfilled` returns `true` for both fulfilled and rejected promises, while `isPromise` only returns `true` for fulfilled promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `isRejected` returns `true` for rejected promises, while `isPromise` only returns `true` for fulfilled promises.

DONE.
