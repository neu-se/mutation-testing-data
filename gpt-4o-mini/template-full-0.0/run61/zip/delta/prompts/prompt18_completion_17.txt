Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the keys of `b` instead of `a`, potentially leading to incorrect differences being reported when `a` and `b` are not equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(a).filter(key => key !== 'someKey')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude a specific key ('someKey') from the comparison, which could lead to missing differences if that key is relevant in the context of the attributes being compared.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(a).concat(Object.keys(a))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would duplicate the keys of `a` in the comparison, potentially causing the `reduce` function to behave incorrectly and report false differences due to the repeated keys.

DONE.
