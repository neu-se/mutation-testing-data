  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - Math.sqrt(a * a + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses addition, while this replacement uses subtraction.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * Math.sqrt(a * a + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses addition, while this replacement uses multiplication.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / Math.sqrt(a * a + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses addition, while this replacement uses division.

DONE.
