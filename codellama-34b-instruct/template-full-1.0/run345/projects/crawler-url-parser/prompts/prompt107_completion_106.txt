  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.baseurl
```
This would result in different behavior because `currentUrl.baseurl` may contain a different URL than `currentUrl.url`, leading to different parsing and analysis results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER> = null;
urlMap.set(<PLACEHOLDER>, currentUrl);
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid key for a `Map` object, so `urlMap.set()` would throw an exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.text = '';
urlMap.set(<PLACEHOLDER>.text, currentUrl);
```
This would result in different behavior because `currentUrl.text` may contain a different value than `currentUrl.url`, leading to different parsing and analysis results.

DONE.
