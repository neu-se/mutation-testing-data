  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfill
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that returns a promise that is rejected, while `fulfill` is a function that returns a promise that is fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that returns a promise that is rejected, while `resolve` is a function that returns a promise that is resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
accept
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that returns a promise that is rejected, while `accept` is a function that returns a promise that is accepted.

DONE.
