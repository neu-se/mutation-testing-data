Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the condition, causing the function to behave incorrectly when `ended` is true, potentially leading to unexpected results in the flow of data processing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the `data` variable instead of the `ended` state, which could lead to the function returning the actual data instead of the termination state, disrupting the intended flow of control.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `null` instead of `ended` would mean that the function does not convey the termination state correctly, potentially causing the caller to misinterpret the end of the data stream.

DONE.
