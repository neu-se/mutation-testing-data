  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] === 'j' || tokens[i + 1] === 'J'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now check for the presence of the imaginary unit 'j' or 'J' instead of the imaginary unit 'i' or 'I'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] === 'e' || tokens[i + 1] === 'E'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now check for the presence of the exponential symbol 'e' or 'E' instead of the imaginary unit 'i' or 'I'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] === 'π' || tokens[i + 1] === 'PI'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now check for the presence of the mathematical constant pi (π) or the string 'PI' instead of
