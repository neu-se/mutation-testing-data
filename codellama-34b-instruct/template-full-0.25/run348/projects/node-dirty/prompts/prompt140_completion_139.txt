  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('Something went wrong'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an error event with a custom message, whereas the original code would emit an error event with the error object passed as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', err);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an error event with the error object passed as an argument, whereas the original code would emit an error event with a custom message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('Something went wrong'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an error event with a custom message, whereas the original code would emit an error event with the error object passed as an argument.

DONE.
