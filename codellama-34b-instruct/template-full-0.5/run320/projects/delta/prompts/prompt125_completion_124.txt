  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (index < start) {
  nextOp = iter.next(start - index);
} else {
  nextOp = iter.next(end - index);
  ops.push(nextOp);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end - index` calculation would be incorrect, leading to an infinite loop or incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (index < start) {
  nextOp = iter.next(start - index);
} else {
  nextOp = iter.next(index - start);
  ops.push(nextOp);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index - start` calculation would be incorrect, leading to an infinite loop or incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (index < start) {
  nextOp = iter.next(start - index);
} else {
  nextOp = iter.next(
