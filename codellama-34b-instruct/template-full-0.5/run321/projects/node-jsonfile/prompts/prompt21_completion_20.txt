  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because the `encoding` property is not being used in the original code fragment, which means that the file would be read with the default encoding instead of the specified one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, options.encoding.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method is not being used in the original code fragment, which means that the file would be read with the specified encoding in the original case instead of the lowercase version.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, options.encoding.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method is not being used in the original code fragment, which means that the file would be read with the specified encoding in the original case instead of the uppercase version.

DONE.
