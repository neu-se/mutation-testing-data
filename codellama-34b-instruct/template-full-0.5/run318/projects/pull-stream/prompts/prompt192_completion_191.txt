  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would change the value of `map` from a function to a number, which would cause the `map` function to fail when it is called later in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operator would change the value of `map` from a function to a number, which would cause the `map` function to fail when it is called later in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator would change the value of `map` from a function to a number, which would cause the `map` function to fail when it is called later in the code.

DONE.
