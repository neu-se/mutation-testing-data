  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.inspect` is a function, and using `object.inspect.call()` would invoke the function immediately, rather than returning the function reference as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect.bind()
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.inspect` is a function, and using `object.inspect.bind()` would create a new function with a bound `this` value, rather than returning the function reference as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect.apply()
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.inspect` is a function, and using `object.inspect.apply()` would invoke the function immediately with a specific `this` value and arguments, rather than returning the function reference as intended.

DONE.
