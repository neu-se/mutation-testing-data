  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.format` method would return a string representation of the parsed URL, whereas `null` is a literal null value and would be returned as is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.format` method would return a string representation of the parsed URL, whereas `""` is an empty string and would be returned as is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.format` method would return a string representation of the parsed URL, whereas `false` is a boolean value and would be returned as is.

DONE.
