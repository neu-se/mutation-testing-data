  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(b, a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan2` expects the arguments in the opposite order, so the resulting angle would be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan(b / a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan` expects the arguments in the opposite order, so the resulting angle would be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan(a / b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan` expects the arguments in the opposite order, so the resulting angle would be incorrect.

DONE.
