  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws an error if the `closed` promise is resolved with a non-null value, while the new code fragment does not throw an error in this case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"*error message*".toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws an error with a specific message, while the new code fragment throws an error with a message that is all uppercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(error) { throw new Error(error.message.toUpperCase()); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws an error with a specific message, while the new code fragment throws an error with a message that is all uppercase. Additionally, the new code fragment uses a function to throw the error, which may change the scope and behavior of the code.

DONE.
