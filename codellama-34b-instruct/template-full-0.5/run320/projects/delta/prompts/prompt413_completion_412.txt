  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.peekLength()` returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, while `thisIter.peekLength` returns the length of the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next().length
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.next()` returns the next operation in the iterator, while `thisIter.peekLength` returns the length of the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next().length
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next()` returns the next operation in the other iterator, while `thisIter.peekLength` returns the length of the current operation.

DONE.
