  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would return a reversed array instead of a slice of the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.concat([1, 2, 3])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would return a concatenated array with the additional elements `[1, 2, 3]` instead of a slice of the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.filter(function(x) { return x % 2 === 0; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would return a filtered array with only the even elements instead of a slice of the original array.

DONE.
