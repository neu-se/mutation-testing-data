  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch` is a method that expects to be called with a specific context, but `this.dispatch.bind(this)` creates a new function that is bound to the current context, which may not be the same as the context in which `this.dispatch` was originally called.

DONE.
