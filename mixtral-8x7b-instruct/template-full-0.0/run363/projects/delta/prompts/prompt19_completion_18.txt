 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.getOwnPropertyNames
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.getOwnPropertyNames` returns only the own enumerable and non-enumerable properties of an object, while `Object.keys` returns only the own enumerable properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
['constructor', ...Object.keys(b)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it includes the `constructor` property of the object, which is not included in the original `Object.keys(a).concat(Object.keys(b))`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(<any>b).propertyIsEnumerable ? Object.keys(b).filter((key) => b.propertyIsEnumerable(key)) : Object.keys(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it filters the keys of the object `b` based on whether the property is enumerable or not, which is not the case in the original `
