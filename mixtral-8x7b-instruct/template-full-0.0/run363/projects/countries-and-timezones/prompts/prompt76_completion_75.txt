 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for null values explicitly, which might not cover cases where timezone is undefined or any other falsy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for undefined values explicitly, which might not cover cases where timezone is null or any other falsy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(timezone).length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for an empty object, which might not cover cases where timezone is a non-empty object but with falsy values for its properties.

DONE.
