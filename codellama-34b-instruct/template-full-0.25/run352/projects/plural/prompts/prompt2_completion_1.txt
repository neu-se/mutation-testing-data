  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-8
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return the last 8 characters of the string, instead of the first 8.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return the last character of the string, instead of the first character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return an empty string, instead of the first character.

DONE.
