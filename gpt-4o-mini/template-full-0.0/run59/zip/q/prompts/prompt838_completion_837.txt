Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.catch
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the handling of promise rejections to use the `catch` method instead of the `then` method, which may not properly handle the unhandled errors as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(null, onUnhandledError)
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly sets the fulfillment handler to `null`, which means that the promise will not handle successful resolutions, potentially leading to unhandled promise rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.finally(onUnhandledError)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `finally` method instead of `then`, which does not allow for handling of fulfillment or rejection separately, thus ignoring the promise's resolution state.

DONE.
