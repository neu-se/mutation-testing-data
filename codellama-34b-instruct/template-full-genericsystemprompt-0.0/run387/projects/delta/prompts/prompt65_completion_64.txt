  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets `newOp.insert` to a non-null value, while this replacement sets it to null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets `newOp.insert` to a non-undefined value, while this replacement sets it to undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = NaN;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets `newOp.insert` to a non-NaN value, while this replacement sets it to NaN.

DONE.
