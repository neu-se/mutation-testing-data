  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fcall
```
This would result in different behavior because `fcall` is a different method than `fapply`, and it would call the function with the arguments as individual arguments, rather than as an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fail
```
This would result in different behavior because `fail` is a method that detects if a promise has been rejected and calls the specified callback if it has. In this case, it would not be passing the rejected value to the callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.done
```
This would result in different behavior because `done` is a method that is called when a promise has been resolved and it would not be passing the resolved value to the callback.

DONE.
