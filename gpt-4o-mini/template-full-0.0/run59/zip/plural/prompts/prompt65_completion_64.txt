Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cactus', 'cactuses'
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly pluralizes "cactus" to "cactuses" instead of the correct "cacti", which would not trigger the intended rule for "bacterium" to "bacteria".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacterium', 'bacterias'
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses "bacterias" as the plural form instead of "bacteria", which would lead to incorrect pluralization for the word "bacterium".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacterium', 'bacterium'
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the same word for both singular and plural, failing to provide a proper pluralization for "bacterium", which should be "bacteria".

DONE.
