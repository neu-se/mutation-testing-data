  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
apply
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of spreading the values of a promised array of arguments into the fulfillment callback, it would apply the values as arguments to the callback function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
call
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of spreading the values of a promised array of arguments into the fulfillment callback, it would pass the arguments to the callback function one by one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
run
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of spreading the values of a promised array of arguments into the fulfillment callback, it would run the callback function with the array of arguments as the `this` context.

DONE.
