  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would emit an error event with the `err` object, while the new code fragment would emit an error event with `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would emit an error event with the `err` object, while the new code fragment would emit an error event with `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would emit an error event with the `err` object, while the new code fragment would emit an error event with a new `Error` object.

DONE.
