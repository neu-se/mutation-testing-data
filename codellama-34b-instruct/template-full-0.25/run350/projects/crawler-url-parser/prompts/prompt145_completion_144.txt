  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a forward slash to indicate the end of the path, while the replaced code uses a backslash, which is a different character that could potentially cause issues with the code's functionality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a forward slash to indicate the end of the path, while the replaced code uses an empty string, which could potentially cause issues with the code's functionality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a forward slash to indicate the end of the path, while the replaced code uses a space character, which is a different character that could potentially cause issues with the code's functionality.

DONE.
