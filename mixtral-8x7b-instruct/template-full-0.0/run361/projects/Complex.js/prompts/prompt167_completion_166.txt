 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
z['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the real part of `z` is zero instead of checking if `z` is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the current complex number is infinite, which is not the same as checking if the denominator is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns `Complex['INFINITY']` regardless of the input.

DONE.
