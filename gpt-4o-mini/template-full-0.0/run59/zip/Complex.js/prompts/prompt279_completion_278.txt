Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly use the sine function instead of the cosine function, leading to an incorrect calculation of the imaginary part of the sine of a complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(a + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the angle `a` before calculating the cosine, which would yield a different value than the intended cosine of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the imaginary part `b` instead of the real part `a` to compute the cosine, leading to an incorrect result for the sine of a complex number.

DONE.
