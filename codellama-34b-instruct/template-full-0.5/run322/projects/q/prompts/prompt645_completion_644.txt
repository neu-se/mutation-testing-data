  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method expects a non-null object as its first argument, and passing `null` would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method expects a non-undefined object as its first argument, and passing `undefined` would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method expects an object with a `promiseDispatch` method as its first argument, and passing an empty object would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

DONE.
