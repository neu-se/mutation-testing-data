  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect` expects a function as its first argument, and passing `null` would cause an exception to be thrown. In the original code, the function `Q.isFulfilled` is passed, which returns a boolean indicating whether the promise is fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect(function (error) { return Math.random() > 0.5; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the function will return either `true` or `false` at random, regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected. In the original code, the function `Q.isFulfilled` is passed, which returns `true` if the promise is fulfilled and `false` otherwise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect(function (error) { return !error; })
```
This would result in different
