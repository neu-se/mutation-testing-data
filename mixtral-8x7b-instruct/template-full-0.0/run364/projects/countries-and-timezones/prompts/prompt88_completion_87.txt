 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'UTC'
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the placeholder with a specific timezone name, which may not match the expected input for the `getCountryForTimezone` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
12345
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the placeholder with an invalid timezone name, causing the `getTimezone` function to return `null` and the `getCountryForTimezone` function to return `null` as well.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the placeholder with a random number, causing the `getTimezone` function to return `null` when the generated number does not match any existing timezone names. This would cause the `getCountryForTimezone` function to return `null`.

DONE.
