  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emission
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.emit` checks the `emission` property on the `this` object, while `this.emission` would check an `emission` property that is a different property or variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emitters()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.emit` is a method call, while `this.emitters()` would be a different method call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
message.emit
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.emit` would refer to the `emit` method on the `this` object, while `message.emit` would refer to the `emit` method on a different object (`message`).

DONE.
