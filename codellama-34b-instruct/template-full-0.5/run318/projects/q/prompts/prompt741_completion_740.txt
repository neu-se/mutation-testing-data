  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(err);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` method would be called with the `err` object, which would cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(promises);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` method would be called with the `promises` array, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the array of promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify({ index: index, value: progress });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify` method would be called with an object containing the `index` and `value` properties, which would cause the promise to be notified with the progress of the promise at the specified index.

DONE.
