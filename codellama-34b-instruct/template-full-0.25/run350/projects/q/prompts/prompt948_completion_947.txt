  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would be called with the wrong value, which would cause the promise to resolve with the wrong value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would be called with the wrong error, which would cause the promise to reject with the wrong error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(progress);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` would be called with the wrong progress value, which would cause the promise to notify with the wrong progress value.

DONE.
