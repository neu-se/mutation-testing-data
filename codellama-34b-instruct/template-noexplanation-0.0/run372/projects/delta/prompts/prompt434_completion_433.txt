  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index - 1]
```
This change will cause the `next` method to return the previous operation instead of the current one, which may cause the test suite to fail if it relies on the correct behavior of the `next` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index + 1]
```
This change will cause the `next` method to return the next operation instead of the current one, which may cause the test suite to fail if it relies on the correct behavior of the `next` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index]
```
This change will cause the `next` method to return the current operation instead of the next one, which may cause the test suite to fail if it relies on the correct behavior of the `next` method.

DONE.
