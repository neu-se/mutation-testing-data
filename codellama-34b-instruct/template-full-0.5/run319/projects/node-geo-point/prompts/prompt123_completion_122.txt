  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a GeoPoint object, but `null` would cause a null reference exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new GeoPoint(0, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a GeoPoint object with non-zero coordinates, but `new GeoPoint(0, 0)` would create a GeoPoint object with zero coordinates, which would cause the calculation to produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a GeoPoint object, but `this` would refer to the current object, which would cause the calculation to produce incorrect results.

DONE.
