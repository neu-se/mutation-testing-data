  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dest + 'foo'
```
This code fragment will cause the `createWriteStream` function to write to a file with a different name than the one specified in the `dest` variable. This can help identify if the test suite is properly checking the file name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/tmp/foo'
```
This code fragment will cause the `createWriteStream` function to write to a file in a different directory than the one specified in the `dest` variable. This can help identify if the test suite is properly checking the file path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'foo'
```
This code fragment will cause the `createWriteStream` function to write to a file with a different name than the one specified in the `dest` variable, but in the same directory. This can help identify if the test suite is properly checking the file name and path.

DONE.
