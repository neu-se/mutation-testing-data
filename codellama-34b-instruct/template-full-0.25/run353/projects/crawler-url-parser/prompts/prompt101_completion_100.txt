  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set
```
This would result in different behavior because `set` is a method that sets a value for a key in a map, whereas `get` is a method that retrieves a value for a key in a map. Using `set` instead of `get` would cause the code to store a new value in the map, rather than retrieving an existing value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a method that removes a key and its associated value from a map, whereas `get` is a method that retrieves a value for a key in a map. Using `delete` instead of `get` would cause the code to remove a key and its associated value from the map, rather than retrieving an existing value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.clear
```
This would result in different behavior because `clear` is a method that removes all key-value pairs
