  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.includes(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes()` is a more modern and concise method of checking if an array includes a specific element, and it may not be supported in all environments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.indexOf(promise) !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it is the same code as the original, but with a different operator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `unhandledRejections` array has any elements, rather than checking if a specific element is present.

DONE.
