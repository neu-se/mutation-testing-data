  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the object is truthy, while this replacement checks the length of the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the object is truthy, while this replacement checks the first element of the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.foo
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the object is truthy, while this replacement checks if the object has a property named "foo".

DONE.
