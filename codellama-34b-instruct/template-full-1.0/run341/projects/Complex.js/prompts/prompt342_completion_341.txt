```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment multiplies the value of `a` by itself, while this new code fragment multiplies `a` by `b`. If `a` and `b` have different values, the result will be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a++
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment multiplies the value of `a` by itself, while this new code fragment increments `a` by 1. If `a` has a value greater than 1, the result will be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
</code>
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a multiplication operator, while this new code fragment is a division operator.

DONE.
