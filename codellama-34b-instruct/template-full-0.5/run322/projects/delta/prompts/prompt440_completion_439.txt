  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.insert === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `nextOp.insert` is a string, while this replacement checks if it is a function. If `nextOp.insert` is a function, the replacement code would return `true`, while the original code would return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.insert !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `nextOp.insert` is a string, while this replacement checks if it is not a string. If `nextOp.insert` is not a string, the replacement code would return `true`, while the original code would return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.insert === 'object' && nextOp.insert !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `nextOp.insert` is a string, while
