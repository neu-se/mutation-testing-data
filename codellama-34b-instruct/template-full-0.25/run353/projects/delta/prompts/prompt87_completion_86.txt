  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the attributes of the last op to the new op, rather than merging them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = { ...lastOp.attributes, ...newOp.attributes }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would merge the attributes of the last op with the new op, rather than replacing them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = { ...newOp.attributes, ...lastOp.attributes }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would merge the attributes of the new op with the last op, rather than the other way around.

DONE.
