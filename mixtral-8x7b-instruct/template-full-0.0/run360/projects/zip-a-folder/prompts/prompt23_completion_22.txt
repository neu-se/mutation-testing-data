 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
new archiver.Archiver('zip', archiverOptions)
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly sets the archive format to 'zip', which may not be desired when calling the `compress` function with a format of 'tar'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
archiver.create('tar', archiverOptions)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates an archiver object with the 'tar' format, which may not be desired when calling the `compress` function with a format of 'zip'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
new archiver.Archiver()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates an archiver object without specifying any format or options, which may lead to unexpected results or errors when piping it to the output stream.

DONE.
