  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than the `,` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(ended && cb)`, which would result in a different value than `ended, cb`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has a higher precedence than the `,` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(ended || cb)`, which would result in a different value than `ended, cb`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended ? cb : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the ternary operator `?:` has a higher precedence than the `,` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(ended ? cb : null)`, which would result in a different value than `ended, cb`.

DONE.
