  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrl` variable would be set to `null`, which would cause the `parse` function to return `null` when called with a relative URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrl` variable would be set to an empty string, which would cause the `parse` function to return an empty string when called with a relative URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrl` variable would be set to `undefined`, which would cause the `parse` function to return `undefined` when called with a relative URL.

DONE.
