  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackRejection
```
This would result in different behavior because `trackRejection` will always add the promise and reason to the `unhandledRejections` and `unhandledReasons` arrays, regardless of whether the rejection has been handled or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
untrackRejection
```
This would result in different behavior because `untrackRejection` will remove the promise from the `unhandledRejections` and `unhandledReasons` arrays, even if the rejection has not been handled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function and will cause an error when called, whereas `untrackRejection` is a function that can be called with a promise and reason as arguments.

DONE.
