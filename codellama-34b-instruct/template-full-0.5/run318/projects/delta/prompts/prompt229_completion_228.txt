  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the current operation in the `thisIter` iterator, rather than the length of the current operation in the `otherIter` iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the length of the current operation in the `otherIter` iterator, which would cause the `diffResult` to be offset by 1 character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the length of the current operation in the `otherIter` iterator, which would cause the `diffResult` to be offset by -1 character.

DONE.
