 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
embedType !== Object.keys(b)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it no longer checks if `embedType` is falsy, allowing operations with different embed types to be considered equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
embedType && embedType !== Object.keys(b)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it now requires `embedType` to be truthy, which could lead to unexpected behavior when comparing operations with falsy embed types.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
embedType !== 'some-arbitrary-string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it now checks against a fixed string instead of the embed type of the second object, which would cause mismatched embed types to be considered equal.

DONE.
