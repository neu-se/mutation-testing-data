  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
precision + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `adjust` function would be called with a different argument, which would cause the `toFixed` method to round the number to a different number of decimal places.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
precision * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `adjust` function would be called with a different argument, which would cause the `toFixed` method to round the number to a different number of decimal places.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(precision)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `adjust` function would be called with a different argument, which would cause the `toFixed` method to round the number to a different number of decimal places.

DONE.
