  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!<PLACEHOLDER>
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT operator, which returns `true` if the operand is falsy and `false` otherwise. In this case, the operand is a function call, which is always truthy, so the resulting expression would always be `false`. This would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, and the `TypeError` would never be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER> === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, which means that the operands must be of the same type and have the same value. In this case, the operand is a function call, which is always truthy, so the resulting expression would always be `false`. This would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, and the `TypeError` would never be thrown.

Option 3: The PL
