  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
< GeoPoint copy(point.coordinates) >
```
This would result in different behavior because the `copy` function would return a new object with the same values as `point.coordinates`, rather than returning the original `point.coordinates` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
< GeoPoint constructor() >
```
This would result in different behavior because the `constructor` function would return a new object with the same values as `point.coordinates`, rather than returning the original `point.coordinates` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
< GeoPoint (point.coordinates) >
```
This would result in different behavior because the parentheses would create a new scope and the code inside the parentheses would be evaluated in that scope, rather than in the original scope.

DONE.
