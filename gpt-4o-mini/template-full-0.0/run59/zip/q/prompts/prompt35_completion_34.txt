Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` to the `task` function may lead to unexpected results or errors, depending on how the `task` function is implemented, whereas the original code likely expects a valid function or value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` to the `task` function may cause it to behave differently than expected, potentially leading to runtime errors or skipped execution, while the original code does not pass any argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task("unexpected string");
```
This would result in different behavior because passing a string instead of a function or expected value to the `task` function could lead to type errors or incorrect processing, diverging from the intended execution flow of the original code.

DONE.
