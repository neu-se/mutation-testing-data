  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(deferred.reject)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the value of `promise`, rather than resolved with the value of `promise`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(deferred.resolve)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the value of `promise`, rather than rejected with the value of `promise`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(value) { return value * 2; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the value of `promise` multiplied by 2, rather than resolved with the value of `promise` itself.

DONE.
