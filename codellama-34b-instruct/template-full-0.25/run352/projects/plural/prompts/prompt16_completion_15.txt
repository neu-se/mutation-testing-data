  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1, w.length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring would be one character shorter than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 2, w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring would be one character longer than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1, w.length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring would be reversed compared to the original code.

DONE.
