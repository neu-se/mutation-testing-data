Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `trackRejection` function to not associate any promise with the rejection reason, potentially leading to untracked rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` would still call `trackRejection`, but it would not properly associate the rejection with a valid promise, which could lead to incorrect handling of the rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly track the rejection of the promise itself instead of the intended rejection, which could lead to confusion in the handling of unhandled rejections.

DONE.
