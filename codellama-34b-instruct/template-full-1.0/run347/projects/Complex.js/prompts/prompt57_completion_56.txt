  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'r' in a && 'arg' in a
```
This would result in different behavior because `arg` is not a property of `a` and the expression would always evaluate to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'r' in a && 're' in a
```
This would result in different behavior because `re` is not a property of `a` and the expression would always evaluate to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'phi' in b && 'arg' in b
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` does not have a property called `arg` and the expression would always evaluate to `false`.

DONE.
