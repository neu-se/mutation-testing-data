 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys` array in `object_keys` function might end up containing `null` values, which is not the case in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
42
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys` array in `object_keys` function might end up containing an extra element with the value `42`, which is not the case in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
object_toString(key)
