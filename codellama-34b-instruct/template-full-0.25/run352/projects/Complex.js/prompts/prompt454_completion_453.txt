  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite` is a different method than `isNaN`, and it checks for the infinity pole instead of the NaN pole.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` is a different method than `isNaN`, and it checks for the finite pole instead of the NaN pole.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isZero` is a different method than `isNaN`, and it checks for the zero pole instead of the NaN pole.

DONE.
