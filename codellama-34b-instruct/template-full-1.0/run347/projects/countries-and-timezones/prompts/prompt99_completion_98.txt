  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of the values of the object's properties, while `Object.keys` returns an array of the names of the object's properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries` returns an array of the key-value pairs of the object's properties, while `Object.keys` returns an array of the names of the object's properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify` returns a string representing the object, while `Object.keys` returns an array of the names of the object's properties.

DONE.
