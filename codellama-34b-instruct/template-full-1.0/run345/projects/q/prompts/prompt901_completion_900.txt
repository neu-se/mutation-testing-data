  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(error));
```
This would result in different behavior because `error` is assigned a value but never used, leading to a bug in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(Promise.reject()));
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject` is called immediately, leading to an error being thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(function () { }));
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty function is assigned to `error`, leading to a bug in the code.

DONE.
