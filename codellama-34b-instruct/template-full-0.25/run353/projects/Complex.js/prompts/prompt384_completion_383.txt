  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `sinh` function to return a different value, which would affect the result of the `tanh` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cosh` function to return a different value, which would affect the result of the `coth` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `tanh` function to return a different value, which would affect the result of the `coth` function.

DONE.
