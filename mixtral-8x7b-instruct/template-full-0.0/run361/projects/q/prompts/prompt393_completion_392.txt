 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `when` function would always return a resolved promise, even if `value` is a rejected promise or a non-promise object with a `then` method. The original code checks if the value is a rejected promise and calls the `rejected` callback if it is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.resolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because if the `Q` object doesn't have a `resolve` method, it would throw a `TypeError`. The original code doesn't check if `Q.resolve` exists, so it assumes that it does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
value.then(fulfilled, rejected, progressed).catch(function (reason) {
  unhandledReasons.push(reason);
  throw reason;
})
```
This would result in different behavior
