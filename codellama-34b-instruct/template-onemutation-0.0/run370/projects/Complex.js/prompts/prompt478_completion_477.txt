  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` checks if a value is `NaN`, while `isFinite` checks if a value is finite. In this case, the code is checking if the imaginary part of the complex number is finite, so using `isNaN` instead would cause the code to produce incorrect results.

DONE.
