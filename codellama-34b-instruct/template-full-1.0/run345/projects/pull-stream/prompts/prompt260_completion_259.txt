  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read = stream.read(null, function (err, data) {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.read()` method is being called on the `stream` object, which is not an object that has a `.read()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read = stream.read(null, function (err, data) {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.read()` method is being called with a null argument, which is not a valid argument for the method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read = stream.read(false, function (err, data) {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.read()` method is being called with a boolean value (false) instead of a function, which is the expected argument for the method.

DONE.
