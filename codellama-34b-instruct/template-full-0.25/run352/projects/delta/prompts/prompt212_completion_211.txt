  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the length of the `other.ops` array is greater than 0, which means that there are more than 0 operations in the `other` delta. Replacing it with `other.ops.length < 0` would cause the code to execute the `if` block if there are fewer than 0 operations in the `other` delta, which is not possible.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the length of the `other.ops` array is greater than 0, which means that there are more than 0 operations in the `other` delta. Replacing it with `other.ops.length === 0` would cause the code to execute the `if` block if there are exactly 0 operations in the `other` delta, which is not the same as the original behavior.
