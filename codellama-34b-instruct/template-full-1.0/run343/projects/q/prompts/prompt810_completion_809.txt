  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Q".reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the given promise is fulfilled, while the mutated code would check if the string "Q" is fulfilled, which would always result in a failure.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the given promise is fulfilled, while the mutated code would check if the length of the string "Q" is fulfilled, which would always result in a failure.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the given promise is fulfilled, while the mutated code would check if the uppercase version of the string "Q" is fulfilled, which would always result in a failure.

DONE.
