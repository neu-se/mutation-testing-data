 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the CommonJS module exports would always be assigned the Q API, regardless of the actual value of `exports`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"string"
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison would always return false, and the Q API would not be assigned to `module.exports`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof window === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the Q API would be assigned to a global variable `Q` only in non-windowed contexts, and not in CommonJS or RequireJS environments.

DONE.
