  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
noIM = true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `noIM` variable is used to check if the imaginary part of the complex number is zero, and by setting it to `true`, the code would always return `Infinity`, even if the imaginary part is not zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
noIM = false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `noIM` variable is used to check if the imaginary part of the complex number is zero, and by setting it to `false`, the code would always return `0`, even if the imaginary part is not zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
noIM = !noIM
```
This would result in different behavior because the `noIM` variable is used to check if the imaginary part of the complex number is zero, and by negating its value, the code would always return the opposite result, even if the imaginary part is zero.
