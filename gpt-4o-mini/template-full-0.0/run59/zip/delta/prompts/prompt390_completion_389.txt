Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `length` variable to be one greater than the actual length of the `otherIter`, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds access or incorrect data being processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reduce the length of the operation being processed from `thisIter`, which could lead to data being skipped or incorrectly retained, altering the final output of the transformation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the length to zero, effectively ignoring any operations from `otherIter`, which would result in the `delta` object only containing operations from `thisIter`, potentially losing important data from the transformation.

DONE.
