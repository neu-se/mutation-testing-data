  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is equal to zero, while the new code fragment checks if `a` is not equal to zero. This change would cause the code to take a different branch in the `if` statement, potentially leading to different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is equal to zero, while the new code fragment checks if `a` is greater than zero. This change would cause the code to take a different branch in the `if` statement, potentially leading to different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is equal to zero, while the new code fragment checks if `a` is less than zero. This change would cause the code to take a different branch in the
