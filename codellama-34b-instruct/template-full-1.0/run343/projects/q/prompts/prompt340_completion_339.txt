  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
((inspected.state === "rejected") && (inspected.reason !== undefined)))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the promise's state to be "pending" or "rejected," but this code fragment only checks for "rejected."

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(inspected.state === "rejected")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the promise's state to be "pending" or "rejected," but this code fragment checks for the state to be neither "pending" nor "rejected."

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(inspected.state === "resolved")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the promise's state to be "pending" or "rejected," but this code fragment checks for the state to be "resolved."

DONE
