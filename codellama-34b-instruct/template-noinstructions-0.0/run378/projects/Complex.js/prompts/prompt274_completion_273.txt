  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'], this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments to `Math.atan2` are swapped, which would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.atan2` function would only receive one argument, which would cause it to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.atan2` function would only receive one argument, which would cause it to return a different value.

DONE.
