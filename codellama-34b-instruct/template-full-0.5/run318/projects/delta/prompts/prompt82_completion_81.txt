  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = arg;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the `arg` object into the `ops` array, rather than the `insert` property of the `newOp` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = attributes;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `attributes` property of the `newOp` object to the `attributes` parameter, rather than the `insert` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.delete = length;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `delete` property of the `newOp` object to the `length` parameter, rather than the `insert` property.

DONE.
