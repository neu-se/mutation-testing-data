  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb
```
This would result in different behavior because `abortCb` is a callback function that was defined earlier in the code, while `cb` is a callback function that was passed as an argument to the `asyncMap` function. Using `abortCb` instead of `cb` would cause the function to behave differently when the `aborted` variable is true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to call the `cb` function with the `abort` argument, which is not the same as calling `cb` with no arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to call the `cb` function with two arguments, `null` and `abort`, which is not the same as calling `cb` with one argument, `abort`.
