  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would be called with a second argument of `1`, which would remove one element from the array, rather than the original code which removes all elements from the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would be called with a second argument of `-1`, which would remove the last element from the array, rather than the original code which removes all elements from the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would be called with a second argument of `this.ops.length - 1`, which would remove all elements from the array except for the last one, rather than the original code which removes all elements from the array.

DONE.
