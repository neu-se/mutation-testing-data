  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` variable is doubled, which would cause the `while` loop to take twice as long to execute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` variable is incremented by 1, which would cause the `while` loop to iterate one more time than it should.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` variable is decremented by 1, which would cause the `while` loop to iterate one fewer times than it should.

DONE.
