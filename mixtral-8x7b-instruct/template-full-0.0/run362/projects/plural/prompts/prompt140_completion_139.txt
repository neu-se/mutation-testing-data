 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the test `rule[0].test(word)` would be skipped, and the rule would not be applied even if the word matches the regular expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the test `rule[0].test(word)` would throw a `TypeError: Cannot read property 'test' of null`, and the rule would not be applied even if the word matches the regular expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
rule[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the test `type(rule[1]) === 'Function'` would always return `true`, and the rule would be applied even if it is not a function. This could lead to unexpected results or errors if the rule is not a function and does not have the expected properties or methods.

DONE.
