Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('write_close');
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits a 'write_close' event instead of a 'read_close' event, which may lead to incorrect handling of the read stream's closure in the application.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', -1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits a 'load' event with a value of -1 instead of the actual size of the data, which could mislead any listeners expecting the correct number of loaded items.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('Read stream closed unexpectedly'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits an error event instead of a 'read_close' event, which would indicate an unexpected closure rather than a normal completion of the read stream.

DONE.
