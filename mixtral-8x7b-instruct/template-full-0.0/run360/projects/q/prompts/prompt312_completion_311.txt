 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method of `null` is not a function, causing a TypeError to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
answerPs[i] || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because if `answerPs[i]` is falsy, it would create a new empty object instead of the intended promise, causing the `then` method to be called on the wrong object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always resolve to a new promise instead of the intended promise from the `answerPs` array, causing the race condition to be broken.

DONE.
