Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek()` does not advance the iterator, so the same operation would be returned repeatedly instead of moving to the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because calling `next(1)` would skip over the actual length of the operation, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the operations in the delta composition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because calling `next(0)` would not advance the iterator at all, effectively causing the same operation to be processed multiple times, which could lead to incorrect results in the composed delta.

DONE.
