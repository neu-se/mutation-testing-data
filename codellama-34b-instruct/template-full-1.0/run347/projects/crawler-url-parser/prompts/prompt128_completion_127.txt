  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.indexOf("http://") !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if `pageurl` is a string, whereas this code is checking if `pageurl` is an HTTP URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.length > 5
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if `pageurl` is a string, whereas this code is checking if `pageurl` has a length greater than 5.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof pageurl === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if `pageurl` is a string, whereas this code is checking if `pageurl` is an object.

DONE.
