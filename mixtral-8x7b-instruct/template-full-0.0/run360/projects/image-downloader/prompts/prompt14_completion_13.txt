 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'basename'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the `options.dest` to the literal string 'basename' instead of the actual basename of the URL path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename(process.cwd())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `options.dest` to the basename of the current working directory instead of the basename of the URL path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random().toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `options.dest` to a random string instead of the basename of the URL path, which could lead to unpredictable results.

DONE.
