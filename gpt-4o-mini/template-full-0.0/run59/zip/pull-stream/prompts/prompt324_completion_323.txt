Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === true ? abort : null
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns `abort` when it is `true`, which could lead to unintended consequences if `abort` is not `null` or if it is a value that the rest of the code does not expect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === false ? null : abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it will only return `null` when `abort` is `false`, which means that if `abort` is `true`, it will return `true` instead of `null`, potentially causing issues in the flow of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === null ? abort : true
```
This would result in different behavior because it will return `true` whenever `abort` is not `null`, which could disrupt the expected handling of the `abort` value and lead to incorrect logic in the program.

DONE.
