  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherOp.delete);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the `delete` property of `otherOp` onto the `ops` array, which is not the same as pushing `otherOp` itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherOp.retain);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the `retain` property of `otherOp` onto the `ops` array, which is not the same as pushing `otherOp` itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherOp.insert);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the `insert` property of `otherOp` onto the `ops` array, which is not the same as pushing `otherOp` itself.

DONE.
