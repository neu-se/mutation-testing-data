  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `targetFilePath` to create a write stream, but replacing it with a string literal would cause the code to fail because it would try to create a write stream from a string, which is not a valid file path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath + "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `targetFilePath` to create a write stream, but replacing it with a concatenated string would cause the code to fail because it would try to create a write stream from a non-existent file path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `targetFilePath` to create a write stream, but replacing it with `undefined` would cause the code to fail because it would try to create a write stream from a non-existent file path.

DONE.
