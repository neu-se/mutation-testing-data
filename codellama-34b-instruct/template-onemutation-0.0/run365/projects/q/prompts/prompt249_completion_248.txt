  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.lastIndexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastIndexOf` returns the last occurrence of the specified value in the string, whereas `indexOf` returns the first occurrence. In this case, the code is looking for the first occurrence of a newline character in the stack trace, so using `lastIndexOf` would cause the code to find the wrong position and potentially return the wrong value.
