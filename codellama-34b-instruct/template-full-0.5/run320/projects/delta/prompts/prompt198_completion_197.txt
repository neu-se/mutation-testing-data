  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 2], newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the last operation in the delta is now one less than before, which could cause the program to access and modify the wrong operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 3], newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the last operation in the delta is now two less than before, which could cause the program to access and modify the wrong operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 4], newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the last operation in the delta is now three less than before, which could cause the program to access and modify the wrong operation.

DONE.
