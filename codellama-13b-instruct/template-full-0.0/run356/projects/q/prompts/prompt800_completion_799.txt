  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(function (value) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `then` method of the `Promise` prototype, while the new code fragment is a function that is called with the `then` method. This could cause unintended side effects or errors if the `then` method is not properly implemented.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `then` method of the `Promise` prototype, while the new code fragment is a reference to the `then` method itself. This could cause unintended side effects or errors if the `then` method is not properly implemented.

this.then(function (value) {
