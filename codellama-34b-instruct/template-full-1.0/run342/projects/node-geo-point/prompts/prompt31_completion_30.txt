  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the Longitude of point1 is compared against the longitude of point2, which is incorrect based on the formula.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the Longitude of point2 is compared against its own latitude, which is incorrect based on the formula.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
radius * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the Longitude of point2 is compared against twice the radius, which is incorrect based on the formula.

DONE.
