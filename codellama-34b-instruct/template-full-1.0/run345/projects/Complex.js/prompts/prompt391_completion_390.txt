  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.acos` returns the arccosine of its argument, whereas `Math.cos` returns the cosine. The arccosine and cosine functions are inverse functions of each other, so the resulting behavior would be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of its argument, whereas `Math.cos` returns a signed value between -1 and 1. The absolute value and signed values functions are not inverse functions of each other, so the resulting behavior would be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cbrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cbrt` returns the cube root of its argument, whereas `Math.cos` returns a complex number based on the input. The cube root and complex number functions are not inverse functions of each other,
