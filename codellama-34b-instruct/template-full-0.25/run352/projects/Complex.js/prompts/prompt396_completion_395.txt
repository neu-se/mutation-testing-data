  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is a variable, while the new code fragment `-b` is a unary minus operator applied to the variable `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is a variable, while the new code fragment `b + 1` is an expression that adds 1 to the value of the variable `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is a variable, while the new code fragment `b * 2` is an expression that multiplies the value of the variable `b` by 2.

DONE.
