  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("get", [])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return an empty array, regardless of the value of `object`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("set", [])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the value of `object` to an empty array, regardless of its original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("delete", [])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always delete the value of `object`, regardless of its original value.

DONE.
