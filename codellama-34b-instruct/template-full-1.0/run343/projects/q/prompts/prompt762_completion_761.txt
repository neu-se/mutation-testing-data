  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var
```
This would result in different behavior because `var` is a keyword used to declare variables in JavaScript, but it is not a function that can be called like `Q` is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that cannot be called like a function, whereas `Q` is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty function is not the same as the `Q` function, which has specific behavior when it is called.

DONE.
