  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a == null
```
This would result in different behavior because `a == null` would return `true` if `a` is `null` or `undefined`, while `typeof a !== 'object'` would only return `true` if `a` is `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `a === null` would only return `true` if `a` is `null`, while `typeof a !== 'object'` would return `true` if `a` is `null` or `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `a !== null` would return `true` if `a` is not `null`, while `typeof a !== 'object'` would return `true` if `a` is not `null` or `undefined`.

DONE.
