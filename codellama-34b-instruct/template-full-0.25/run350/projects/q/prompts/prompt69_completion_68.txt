  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port1.postMessage
```
This would result in different behavior because `port1` is not defined in the code, and would cause a `ReferenceError` when the code is executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port2.postMessage(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `postMessage` expects a message as its first argument, and passing `0` as the message would cause the message to be sent with a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port2.postMessage(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `postMessage` expects a message as its first argument, and passing `null` as the message would cause the message to be sent with a different value than the original code.

DONE.
