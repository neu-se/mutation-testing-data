  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.push(args);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `messages` array to always be pushed to, even if the promise has already been resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.pop(args);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `messages` array to always be popped from, even if it is already empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var tmp = messages;
messages = [];
messages.push(args);
messages.push(tmp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `messages` array to be cleared and then refilled with the same contents, in addition to the new `args` value.

DONE.
