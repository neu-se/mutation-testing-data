  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at index 1 instead of 0, potentially skipping the first element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at index -1, which is an invalid index in JavaScript.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = "hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at index "hello", which is a string and not a number, and would likely cause a type error.

DONE.
