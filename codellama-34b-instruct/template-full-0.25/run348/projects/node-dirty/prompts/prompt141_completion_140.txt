  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `emit` method to be called with the `'error'` event, which would trigger the error handling logic in the `Dirty` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `emit` method to be called with the `'drain'` event, which would trigger the drain handling logic in the `Dirty` class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `emit` method to be called with the `'close'` event, which would trigger the close handling logic in the `Dirty` class.

DONE.
