  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType(thisIter.peekType()) !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the next operation in the other iterator is not an insert, instead of checking if it is an insert.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType(thisIter.peekLength()) !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the next operation in the other iterator is not an insert, and it would use the length of the current operation in the this iterator as the argument for the peekType method, instead of using the current operation itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType(otherIter.peekLength()) !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the next operation in the other iterator is not an insert, and it would use the length of the next operation in the other iterator as the argument for
