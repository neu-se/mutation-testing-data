 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"1: " + stackLine
```
This would result in different behavior because it prepends "1: " to the stack line, which may cause issues in any functions that rely on the exact output of the `filterStackString` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
stackLine.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the stack line to uppercase, which may cause issues in any functions that rely on the exact output of the `filterStackString` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
globalThis.stackLine
