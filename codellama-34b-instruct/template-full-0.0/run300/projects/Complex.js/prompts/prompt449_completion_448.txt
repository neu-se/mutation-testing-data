  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the real part of the complex number by the number of places, instead of the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the result of multiplying the imaginary part of the complex number by the number of places.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the result of multiplying the imaginary part of the complex number by the number of places by 2.

DONE.
