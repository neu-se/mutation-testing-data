  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method is being called with the `reverse` method, which would return a reversed copy of the array, rather than a slice of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method is being called with the `pop` method, which would remove the last element of the array and return it, rather than a slice of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.concat([])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method is being called with the `concat` method, which would concatenate the array with an empty array, rather than a slice of the array.

DONE.
