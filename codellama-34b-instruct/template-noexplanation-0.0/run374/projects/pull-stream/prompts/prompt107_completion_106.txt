  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, done
```
This change will cause the `drain` function to receive `undefined` as its first argument, which may cause it to behave differently than when it receives `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null
```
This change will cause the `drain` function to receive two `null` values as its arguments, which may cause it to behave differently than when it receives a single `null` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done, null
```
This change will cause the `drain` function to receive `done` as its first argument and `null` as its second argument, which may cause it to behave differently than when it receives `null` as its first argument.

DONE.
