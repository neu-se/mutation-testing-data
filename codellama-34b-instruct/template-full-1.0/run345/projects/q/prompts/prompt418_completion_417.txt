  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return inspected.value === value;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===v` operator checks for both the value and the type of the operands, which is not the intended behavior in this case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return inspected.value === "something completely different";
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===v` operator checks for both the value and the type of the operands, which is not the intended behavior in this case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return inspected.value !== "something completely different";
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==v` operator checks for the value only and not the type of the operands, which is not the intended behavior in this case.

DONE.
