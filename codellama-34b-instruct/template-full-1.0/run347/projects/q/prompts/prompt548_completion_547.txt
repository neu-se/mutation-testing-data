  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.message
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the message property of the exception object, while the original code uses the exception object directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandled exception"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a hardcoded string instead of the exception object, which would change the behavior of the error handling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new error object using the original exception object as the message, which would change the behavior of the error handling.

DONE.
