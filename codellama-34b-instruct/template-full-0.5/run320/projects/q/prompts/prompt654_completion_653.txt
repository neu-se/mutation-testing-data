  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fapply(object, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fapply` is a different function than `Q`, and it would not have the same behavior as the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fbind(object, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fbind` is a different function than `Q`, and it would not have the same behavior as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fcall(object, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fcall` is a different function than `Q`, and it would not have the same behavior as the original code.

DONE.
