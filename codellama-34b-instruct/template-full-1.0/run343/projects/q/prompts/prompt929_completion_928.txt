  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.pop` would mutate the `args` array by removing the last element, whereas `args.unshift` would mutate the array by adding an element to the beginning.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.length = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.length = 0` would empty the `args` array, whereas `args.unshift` would add an element to the beginning of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.push(foo)
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.push(foo)` would add the element `foo` to the end of the `args` array, whereas `args.unshift` would add an element to the beginning of the array.

DONE.
