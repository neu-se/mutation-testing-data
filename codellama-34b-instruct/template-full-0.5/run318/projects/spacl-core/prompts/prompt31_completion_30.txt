  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `#` character is not a special character in regular expressions, so it would not match the same set of characters as the `$` character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'*'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` character is a special character in regular expressions that matches zero or more of the preceding character, so it would not match the same set of characters as the `$` character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `\\` character is an escape character in regular expressions, so it would not match the same set of characters as the `$` character.

DONE.
