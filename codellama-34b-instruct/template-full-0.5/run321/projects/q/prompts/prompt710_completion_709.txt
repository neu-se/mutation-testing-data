  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("keys", [])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was using the "keys" method, but this new code would use the "dispatch" method with the "keys" argument, which would likely have a different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("values", [])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was using the "keys" method, but this new code would use the "dispatch" method with the "values" argument, which would likely have a different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("entries", [])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was using the "keys" method, but this new code would use the "dispatch" method with the "entries" argument, which would likely have a different behavior.

DONE.
