  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the imaginary part is zero, but the new code checks if the real part is not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['sign'] == 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the imaginary part is zero, but the new code checks if the sign of the imaginary part is positive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] == -this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the imaginary part is zero, but the new code checks if the imaginary part is equal to the negative of the real part.

DONE.
