 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pageurl.host === linkurl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because a strict equality check (`===`) is used instead of the loose equality check (`==`). If the `host` properties are of the same type, the behavior would remain the same. However, if the types are different (e.g., one is a string and the other is a number), the strict equality check would fail, while the loose equality check might still succeed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pageurl.hostname == linkurl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because the `host` property of the `pageurl` object is being compared with the `hostname` property of the `linkurl` object. This could lead to different results if the `port` property is set in either of the URLs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pageurl.host.toString() == linkurl.host.toString()
