  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise instead of rejecting it, which would cause the `then` method to be called instead of the `fail` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` would notify the promise instead of rejecting it, which would cause the `progress` method to be called instead of the `fail` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject("error")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with a specific error message instead of just rejecting it, which would cause the `fail` method to be called with the error message instead of just being called without any arguments.

DONE.
