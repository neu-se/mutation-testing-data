 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 * deg2rad(point2.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces an unnecessary multiplication by 1, which can cause floating point precision issues.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.asin(point2Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Math.asin` function directly instead of the `asin` constant, which may have different rounding behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan2(y, x) / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it divides the result by 2, which would change the output range of the `calculateBearing` function.

DONE.
