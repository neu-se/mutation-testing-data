  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the `data` variable, which is an object. Replacing it with `null` would cause the `test` function to receive a different value, potentially leading to a different outcome.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the `data` variable, which is an object. Replacing it with `undefined` would cause the `test` function to receive a different value, potentially leading to a different outcome.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the `data` variable, which is an object. Replacing it with an empty object `{}` would cause the `test` function to receive a different value, potentially leading to a different outcome.

DONE.
