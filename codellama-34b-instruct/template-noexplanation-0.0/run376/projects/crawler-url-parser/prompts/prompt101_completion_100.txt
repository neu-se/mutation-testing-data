  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set
```
This change will cause the `extract` function to always set the value of the `urlMap` map, rather than getting the value. This will result in the `urlMap` map being populated with duplicate entries, which may cause the `gettype` function to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.delete
```
This change will cause the `extract` function to delete the value of the `urlMap` map, rather than getting the value. This will result in the `urlMap` map being empty, which may cause the `gettype` function to return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.clear
```
This change will cause the `extract` function to clear the `urlMap` map, rather than getting the value. This will result in the `urlMap` map being empty, which may cause the `gettype` function to return incorrect results.

DONE.
