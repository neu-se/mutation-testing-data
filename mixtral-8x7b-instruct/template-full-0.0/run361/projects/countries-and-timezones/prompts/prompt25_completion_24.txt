 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => getOffsetStr(dstOffset)
```
This would result in different behavior because the arrow function would create a new scope, causing `getOffsetStr` to be called with the global `dstOffset` value instead of the `dstOffset` value in the `result` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(utcOffset)
```
This would result in different behavior because `getOffsetStr` would be called with the `utcOffset` value instead of the `dstOffset` value, which could be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(Math.floor(dstOffset))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `Math.floor` function to round the `dstOffset` value before passing it to `getOffsetStr`, which could result in a different output if the `dstOffset` value is not an integer.

DONE.
