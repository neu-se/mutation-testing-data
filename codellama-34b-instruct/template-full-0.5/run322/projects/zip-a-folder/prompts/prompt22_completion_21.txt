  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!zipAFolderOptions || !zipAFolderOptions.customWriteStream

This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `zipAFolderOptions` object exists and if it has a `customWriteStream` property, while this new code checks if the `zipAFolderOptions` object does not exist or if it does not have a `customWriteStream` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `zipAFolderOptions` object exists and if it has a `customWriteStream` property, while this new code checks if the `zipAFolderOptions` object exists and if its `customWriteStream` property is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `zipAFolderOptions` object exists and if
