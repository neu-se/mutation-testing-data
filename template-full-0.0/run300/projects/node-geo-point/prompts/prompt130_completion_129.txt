  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `this` refers to the current instance of the `GeoPoint` class, while `null` would refer to a null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `this` refers to the current instance of the `GeoPoint` class, while `undefined` would refer to an undefined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `this` refers to the current instance of the `GeoPoint` class, while `{}` would refer to an empty object.

DONE.
