  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would not be called, and the `currentUrlStr` variable would not be modified.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would be called, and the `currentUrlStr` variable would be modified to include the `#` character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#abc'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would be called, and the `currentUrlStr` variable would be modified to include the `#abc` string.

DONE.
