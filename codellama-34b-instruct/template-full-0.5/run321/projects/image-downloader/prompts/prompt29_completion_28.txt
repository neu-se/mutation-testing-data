  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `http` protocol is used instead of `https`, which could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'ftp'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ftp` protocol is used instead of `https`, which is not supported by the `follow-redirects` library.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://example.com'
```
This would result in different behavior because the URL is hardcoded to `https://example.com` instead of being determined dynamically based on the `url` parameter.

DONE.
