  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('write_close', true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits the event with no arguments, while the modified code emits the event with a `true` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('write_close', false);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits the event with no arguments, while the modified code emits the event with a `false` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('write_close', 'error');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits the event with no arguments, while the modified code emits the event with a `'error'` string argument.

DONE.
