Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
indices[r]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `indices[l]` to determine the start index of the subarray for the partial sorting, but using `indices[r]` would change the start index to the end index of the current range, potentially affecting the correctness of the partial sorting.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
l
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `indices[l]` to determine the start index of the subarray for the partial sorting, but using just `l` would directly use the loop counter as the start index, ignoring the calculated indices based on the quantile values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.floor((l + r) / 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `indices[l]` to determine the start index of the subarray for the partial sorting, but using the average of `l` and `r` would change the start index to the middle of the current range, potentially affecting the correctness of the partial sorting.
