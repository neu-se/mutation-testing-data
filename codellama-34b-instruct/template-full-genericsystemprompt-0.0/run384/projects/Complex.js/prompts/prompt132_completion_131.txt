  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `Complex.NAN` when both operands are infinite, instead of `Complex.INFINITY`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `Complex.INFINITY` when either operand is infinite, instead of `Complex.NAN`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && !z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `Complex.INFINITY` when the first operand is infinite and the second operand is not, instead of `Complex.NAN`.

DONE.
