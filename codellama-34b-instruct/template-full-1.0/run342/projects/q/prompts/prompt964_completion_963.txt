  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `this` to refer to the Promise.prototype object, while the mutated code would use `null`. This could cause the code to fail if it relies on the `this` object being available.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `this` to refer to the Promise.prototype object, while the mutated code would use `undefined`. This could cause the code to fail if it relies on the `this` object being available.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `this` to refer to the Promise.prototype object, while the mutated code would use a new anonymous function. This could cause the code to fail if it relies on the `this` object being available.

DONE.
