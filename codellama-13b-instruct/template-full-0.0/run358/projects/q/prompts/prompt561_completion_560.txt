  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.return(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.return` function throws a `QReturnValue` exception with the `exception` value, which would cause the `continuer` function to catch the exception and return a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.return(exception.value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.return` function throws a `QReturnValue` exception with the `exception.value` value, which would cause the `continuer` function to catch the exception and return a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.return(exception.message)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.return` function throws a `QReturnValue` exception with the `exception.message` value, which would cause the `continuer` function to catch the exception and return a rejected promise.

DONE.
