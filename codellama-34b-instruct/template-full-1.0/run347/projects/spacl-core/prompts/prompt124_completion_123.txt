  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match[0] === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `match[0]` would refer to the matched substring at the beginning of the string, rather than the entire match object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match.slice(1) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `match.slice(1)` would return a substring of the entire match starting at index 1, rather than the entire match object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match.indexOf(path) === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because `match.indexOf(path)` would search for the substring `path` within the match object, and return -1 if not found, rather than comparing the entire match object to `null`.

DONE.
