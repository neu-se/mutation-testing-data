 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` function would be called instead of `cb` when an abort signal is received, which might not be expected by the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments passed to `cb` has been changed, which might not be handled correctly by the test suite.
