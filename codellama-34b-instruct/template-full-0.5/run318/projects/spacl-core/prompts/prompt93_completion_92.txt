  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.delete` would delete the element from the map, whereas `this.set` would set the element in the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.clear
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.clear` would clear the entire map, whereas `this.set` would set the element in the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.get` would retrieve the element from the map, whereas `this.set` would set the element in the map.

DONE.
