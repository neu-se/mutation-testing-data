  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` modifies the original array, while `unshift` creates a new array with the new item added at the beginning.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` adds the item to the end of the array, while `unshift` adds it to the beginning.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` creates a new array containing all elements except the first one, while `unshift` adds a new item at the beginning of the array.

DONE.
