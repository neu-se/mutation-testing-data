  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect` is a method on the `Promise` class, and `this` is not a `Promise` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect` is a method on the `Promise` class, and it requires an argument to be passed to it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return inspect(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect` is a function that returns an object, and we are returning a function that returns the result of calling `inspect()`.

DONE.
