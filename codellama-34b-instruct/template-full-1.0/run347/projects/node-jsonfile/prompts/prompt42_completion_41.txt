  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stringify(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `stringify` would return a string representation of `null`, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stringify({})
```
This would result in different behavior because `stringify` would return a string representation of an empty object, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stringify({ hello: 'world' })
```
This would result in different behavior because `stringify` would return a string representation of an object with a property named `hello` set to the value `'world'`, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

DONE.
