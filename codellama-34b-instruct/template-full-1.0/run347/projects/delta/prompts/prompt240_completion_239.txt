  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter` is not the same as `thisIter`, and it may have a different length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length
```
This would result in different behavior because `length` is not the same as `thisIter.peekLength()`, and it may not be the correct number of characters to delete.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is not the same as `thisIter.peekLength()` or `otherIter.peekLength()`, and it may cause the code to delete the wrong number of characters.
