  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite'](Infinity)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for whether the input is infinite, while the modified code fragment checks for whether the input is equal to the constant `Infinity`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite'](-Infinity)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for whether the input is infinite, while the modified code fragment checks for whether the input is equal to the constant `-Infinity`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite'](NaN)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for whether the input is infinite, while the modified code fragment checks for whether the input is equal to the constant `NaN`.

DONE.
