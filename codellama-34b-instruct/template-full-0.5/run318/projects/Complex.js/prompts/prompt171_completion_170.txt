  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / c
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a division by zero error when `c` is zero, whereas the original code would return `Complex['ZERO']`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b / c
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a division by zero error when `c` is zero, whereas the original code would return `Complex['ZERO']`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * c
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an overflow when `a` and `c` are large numbers, whereas the original code would return `Complex['INFINITY']`.

DONE.
