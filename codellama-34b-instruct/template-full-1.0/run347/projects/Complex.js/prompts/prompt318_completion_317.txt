  Sure! Here are three potential mutations for the `PLACEHOLDER` in the `sec` function:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `Math.random()`
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` returns a random floating-point number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive), while `b` is a constant value. This would cause the `sec` function to return a random value each time it is called, which is likely not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `a`
This would result in different behavior because `a` is the real part of the complex number, while `b` is the imaginary part. This would cause the `sec` function to return the wrong value for the real part of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `b * 2`
This would result in different behavior because `b` is a constant value, while `b * 2` is twice the value of `b`. This would cause the `
