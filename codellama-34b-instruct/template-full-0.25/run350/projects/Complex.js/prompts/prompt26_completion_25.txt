  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw 'Invalid Param';
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws a `SyntaxError`, while this replacement throws a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('Invalid Param');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws a `SyntaxError`, while this replacement throws an `Error` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new TypeError('Invalid Param');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws a `SyntaxError`, while this replacement throws a `TypeError` object.

DONE.
