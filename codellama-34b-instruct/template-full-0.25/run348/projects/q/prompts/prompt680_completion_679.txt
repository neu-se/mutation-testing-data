  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument passed to `dispatch` would be different, potentially causing the method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 3)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument passed to `dispatch` would be different, potentially causing the method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 4)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the fourth argument passed to `dispatch` would be different, potentially causing the method to behave differently.

DONE.
