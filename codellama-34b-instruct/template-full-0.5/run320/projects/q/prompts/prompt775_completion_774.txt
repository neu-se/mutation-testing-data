  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the error `err`, rather than resolved with the value of `promise`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the value of `promise`, rather than rejected with the error `err`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(promise, function (result) {
    throw err;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the value of `promise`, but then throw the error `err` after the promise has been resolved.

DONE.
