  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set
```
This would result in different behavior because `set` is a method that sets a value in the data object, whereas `get` is a method that retrieves a value from the data object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a method that deletes a value from the data object, whereas `get` is a method that retrieves a value from the data object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.size
```
This would result in different behavior because `size` is a property that returns the number of values in the data object, whereas `get` is a method that retrieves a value from the data object.

DONE.
