  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan(coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 180) + 1 / Math.sin(coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 180)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Math.cos` while the replacement uses `Math.sin`. This would cause the calculation of the tile coordinates to be incorrect, leading to a different result when calling the `toTile` method.

DONE.
