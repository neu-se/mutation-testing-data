  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `inverted.delete` would delete the entire line, whereas `inverted.retain` would only retain the line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.retain(Op.length(op), {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the entire line with an empty attribute map, whereas the original code would retain the line with the original attribute map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.retain(Op.length(op), { color: 'red' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the entire line with a red color attribute, whereas the original code would retain the line with the original attribute map.

DONE.
