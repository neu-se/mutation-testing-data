 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prevent corking the write stream, causing potential data loss if the buffer is not empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._queue.size
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prevent flushing the queue if there are items in the queue but `_waitForDrain` is true, causing potential data loss.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._writeStream.write(data, () => {
  if (!cbs.length) this.emit('error', err);
  if (--this._inFlightWrites <= 0 && !this._waitForDrain) this.emit('drain');
  for (const cb of cbs) cb(err);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not wait for the 'drain' event before emitting 'drain', potentially causing
