  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match a different pattern in the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag would cause the regular expression to match all occurrences of the pattern in the URL, instead of just the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag would cause the regular expression to ignore the case of the letters in the pattern, so it would match "default.pdf" as well as "Default.pdf".

DONE.
