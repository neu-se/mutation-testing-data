  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push(otherOp).delete(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` method is called with an argument of `1`, which would delete the first character of the `otherOp` operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push(otherOp).delete(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` method is called with an argument of `2`, which would delete the first two characters of the `otherOp` operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push(otherOp).delete(3)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` method is called with an argument of `3`, which would delete the first three characters of the `otherOp` operation.

DONE.
