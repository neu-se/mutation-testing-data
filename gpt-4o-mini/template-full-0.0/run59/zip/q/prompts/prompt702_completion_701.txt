Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first argument instead of returning all arguments starting from the second, potentially leading to incorrect function calls.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.from(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new array from the arguments object, which may not maintain the intended structure or type of the original arguments, affecting how they are processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the first argument instead of all subsequent arguments, which would likely cause the function to fail or behave incorrectly when expecting multiple arguments.

DONE.
