  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the string would be increased by 1, which could cause the code to access an index that is out of bounds.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the string would be decreased by 1, which could cause the code to skip over a character in the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the string would be doubled, which could cause the code to access an index that is out of bounds.

DONE.
