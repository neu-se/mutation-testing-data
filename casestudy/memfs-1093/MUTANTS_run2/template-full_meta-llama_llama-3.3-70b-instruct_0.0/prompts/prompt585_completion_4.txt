Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.closeSync, [fd], callback
```
This would result in different behavior because `closeSync` is a synchronous method that does not take a callback, whereas the original code uses `closeFile` with a callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.closeFile, [file], () => callback()
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback is being called without passing any potential error or result, unlike the original code which passes the result of `closeFile` to the callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.wrapAsync.bind(this), [this.closeFile, [file]], callback
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` is being used to set the context of `wrapAsync`, but it's not necessary in this case, and the original code does not use `bind` explicitly.

DONE.
