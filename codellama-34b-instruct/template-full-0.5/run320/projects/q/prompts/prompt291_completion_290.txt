  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject("error")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the string "error", whereas the original code would not reject the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve("value")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the string "value", whereas the original code would not resolve the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify("progress")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be notified with the string "progress", whereas the original code would not notify the promise.

DONE.
