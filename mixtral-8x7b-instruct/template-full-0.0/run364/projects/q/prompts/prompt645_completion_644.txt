 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method expects a valid object, and `null` would cause a TypeError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method expects a valid object, and a number like `0` would not have the same methods as an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method expects an object with a specific structure, and a resolved promise would not have the same methods as the expected object.

DONE.
