  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length() < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<` operator checks if the length of the line is less than 0, which is always false, so the predicate would never be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length() === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks if the length of the line is equal to 0, which is always true, so the predicate would always be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length() !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks if the length of the line is not equal to 0, which is always false, so the predicate would never be called.

DONE.
