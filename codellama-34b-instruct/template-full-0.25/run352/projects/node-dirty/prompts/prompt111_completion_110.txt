  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer.slice(0, -1)}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last character of the buffer before creating the error message, which could potentially change the error message and cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer.toUpperCase()}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the buffer to uppercase before creating the error message, which could potentially change the error message and cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer.split('').reverse().join('')}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the buffer before creating the error message, which could potentially change the error message and cause the test to fail.

DONE.
