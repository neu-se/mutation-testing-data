  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type !== 'Point' || point.coordinates.length !== 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also check that the `coordinates` property of the `point` object is an array with two elements, which is not checked in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type !== 'Point' && point.coordinates.length !== 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check that the `type` property of the `point` object is not equal to `'Point'`, and that the `coordinates` property is not an array with two elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type !== 'Point' || point.coordinates.length !== 2 || point.coordinates[0] !== point.coordinates[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also check that the first and second elements of the `coordinates` array are not equal,
