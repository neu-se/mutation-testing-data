  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `url` property of the `currentUrl` object would be set to `null`, which would cause the `urlMap.has(currentUrl.url)` check to fail and the code within the `if` block to be skipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `url` property of the `currentUrl` object would be set to `undefined`, which would cause the `urlMap.has(currentUrl.url)` check to fail and the code within the `if` block to be skipped.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because the `url` property of the `currentUrl` object would be set to an empty string, which would cause the `urlMap.has(currentUrl.url)` check to fail and the code within the `if` block to be skipped.

DONE
