  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.npost(object, name, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.npost` is a different function than `Q.nmapply`, and it would not pass the `args` array to the method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.ninvoke(object, name, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.ninvoke` is a different function than `Q.nmapply`, and it would not pass the `args` array to the method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.nsend(object, name, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nsend` is a different function than `Q.nmapply`, and it would not pass the `args` array to the method.

DONE.
