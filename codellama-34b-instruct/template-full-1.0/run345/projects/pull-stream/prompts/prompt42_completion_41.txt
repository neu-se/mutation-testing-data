  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` check would fail, and the function would assume that `args` is an array, leading to potentially incorrect behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be using the `args` variable instead of the `arguments` object, which could lead to incorrect results or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull.arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be using the `pull.arguments` property instead of the `arguments` object, which could lead to incorrect results or errors.

Done.
