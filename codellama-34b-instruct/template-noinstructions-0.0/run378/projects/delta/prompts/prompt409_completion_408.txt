  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return index;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the result of the `chop` method, which removes any trailing empty retain ops from the delta, while this replacement code fragment returns the `index` variable, which may not be the same as the result of the `chop` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return index + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the result of the `chop` method, which removes any trailing empty retain ops from the delta, while this replacement code fragment returns the `index` variable plus 1, which may not be the same as the result of the `chop` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return index - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the result of the `chop` method, which removes any trailing empty retain ops from the delta, while this replacement code
