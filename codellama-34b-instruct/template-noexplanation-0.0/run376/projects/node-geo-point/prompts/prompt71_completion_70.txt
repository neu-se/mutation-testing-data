  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ + Math.PI
```
This code fragment will add π to the value of θ, which will cause the bearing calculation to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ - Math.PI
```
This code fragment will subtract π from the value of θ, which will cause the bearing calculation to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * θ
```
This code fragment will double the value of θ, which will cause the bearing calculation to be incorrect.

DONE.
