Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length, Q
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the input to `array_map` from the actual promises array to its length, which would cause the mapping function to operate on a number instead of the promises, leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q, promises
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the order of the arguments passed to `array_map`, which would cause the function to treat `Q` as the array of promises instead of the actual promises, resulting in unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, promises
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the first argument with `undefined`, which would cause `array_map` to not iterate over the promises at all, effectively skipping the mapping process and returning an incorrect result.

DONE.
