  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule[0]` is a regular expression, and `rule[1]` is a function. Replacing `rule[1]` with `rule[0]` would cause the function to return the regular expression instead of the plural form of the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, and would cause the function to throw an error when trying to call it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because `1` is not a function, and would cause the function to return the first element of the `rules` array, which is a regular expression, instead of the plural form of the word.

DONE.
