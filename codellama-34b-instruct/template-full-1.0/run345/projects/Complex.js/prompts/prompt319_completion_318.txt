  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinh` and `cosh` are inverse hyperbolic functions, but they are not equivalent.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1+Math.cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because `1+Math.cosh` is a different mathematical expression than `Math.cosh`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` and `Math.cosh` are not related mathematical functions.

DONE.
