  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because a null value does not have a `then` property, so the error would be thrown earlier.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` does not have a `then` property, so the error would be thrown earlier.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ then: "" }
```
This would result in different behavior because a plain object with an incompatible `then` property would be created, which would cause a different error to be thrown.

DONE.
