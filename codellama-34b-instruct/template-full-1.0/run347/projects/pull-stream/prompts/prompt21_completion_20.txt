  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read && ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if `ref[1]` is truthy and not if it's actually a function like the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read || ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if `read` is truthy and not if `ref[1]` is truthy, and it would also call the function with a different argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read && ref[1]()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `ref[1]` as a function instead of just checking if it's truthy, and it would pass the return value of `read` as an argument to `ref[1]` instead of passing `read` directly.

DONE.
