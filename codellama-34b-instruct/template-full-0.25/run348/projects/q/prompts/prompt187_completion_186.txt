  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split("at ")[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the "at " prefix from the stack line, which could cause the `isNodeFrame` function to misinterpret the stack line as a Node frame.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split("at ")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the function name and parentheses from the stack line, which could cause the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function to misinterpret the stack line as a Firefox-style stack line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split("at ")[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the filename and line number from the stack line, which could cause the `isInternalFrame` function to misinterpret the stack line as an internal frame.

DONE.
