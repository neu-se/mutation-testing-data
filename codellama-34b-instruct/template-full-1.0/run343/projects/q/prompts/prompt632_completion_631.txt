  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[object]`[key]`
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to access a property on the `object` that is not actually an object, which would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`[key]`
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to access the `key` property of the global object, instead of the `object` that was intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`key`
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to access the `key` property of the global object, instead of the `object` that was intended.

DONE.
