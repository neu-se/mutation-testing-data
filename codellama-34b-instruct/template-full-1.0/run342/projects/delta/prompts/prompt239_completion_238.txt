  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` operator always deletes one character, regardless of the value of `length`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` operator would delete in the opposite direction, starting from the end of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` operator would not delete any characters, effectively doing nothing.

DONE.
