  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset + length
```
This change will cause the `substr` method to return a different substring than the original code, which may cause the test suite to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - offset
```
This change will cause the `substr` method to return a different substring than the original code, which may cause the test suite to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset - length
```
This change will cause the `substr` method to return a different substring than the original code, which may cause the test suite to fail.

DONE.
