  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to retain the current operation, rather than skipping it as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to retain the current operation, rather than skipping it as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to skip the current operation, rather than retaining it as intended.

DONE.
