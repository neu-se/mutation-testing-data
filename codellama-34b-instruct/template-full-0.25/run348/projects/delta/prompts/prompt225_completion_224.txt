  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[1], strings[0], cursor
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the strings is reversed, which would cause the diff algorithm to produce a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0], strings[1], null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cursor` parameter is set to `null`, which would cause the diff algorithm to produce a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0], strings[1], strings[0].length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cursor` parameter is set to the length of the first string, which would cause the diff algorithm to produce a different output.

DONE.
