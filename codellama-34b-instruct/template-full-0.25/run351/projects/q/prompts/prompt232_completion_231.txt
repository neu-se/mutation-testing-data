  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
operands[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `operands[0]` is the first operand passed to the `when` method, which is the promise to wait for, while `operands[1]` is the progress listener function. Using `operands[0]` instead of `operands[1]` would cause the progress listener to be called with the promise to wait for, instead of the progress value, which would likely cause the code to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
operands[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because `operands[2]` is the third operand passed to the `when` method, which is the value to return from the promise, while `operands[1]` is the progress listener function. Using `operands[2]` instead of `operands[1]` would cause the progress listener to be called with the value to return from the promise, instead of the progress value, which would likely cause the code to behave unexpectedly.
