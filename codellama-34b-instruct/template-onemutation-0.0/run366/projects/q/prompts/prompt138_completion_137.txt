  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
hasStacks &&
        promise.stack &&
        typeof error === "object" &&
        error !== null &&
        error.stack &&
        false
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `false` condition would always evaluate to `false`, causing the `if` statement to never execute, even if the other conditions are `true`.
