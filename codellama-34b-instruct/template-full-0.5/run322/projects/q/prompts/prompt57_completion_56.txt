  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { throw new Error("Testing mutation"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it throws an error, whereas the original code fragment simply calls the `flush` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return "Testing mutation"; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a string, whereas the original code fragment calls the `flush` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns `undefined`, whereas the original code fragment calls the `flush` function.

DONE.
