  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid value for the `fulfilled` callback, and using it would cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid value for the `fulfilled` callback, and using it would cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because `true` is not a valid value for the `fulfilled` callback, and using it would cause the promise to be rejected.

DONE.
