  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be true when `b` is positive, whereas the original code fragment would only be true when `b` is negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be true when `b` is zero, whereas the original code fragment would only be true when `b` is negative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b < 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be true when `b` is less than one, whereas the original code fragment would only be true when `b` is negative.

DONE.
