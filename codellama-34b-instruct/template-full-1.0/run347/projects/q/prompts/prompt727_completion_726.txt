  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `all` function to resolve the promise immediately when the `promises` array is empty, even if there are pending promises that have not been resolved yet.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index === promises.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `all` function to resolve the promise only when the last promise in the `promises` array is resolved, even if there are other pending promises that have not been resolved yet.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `all` function to resolve the promise immediately if there are any pending promises that have been rejected, even if there are other pending promises that have not been resolved yet.

DONE.
