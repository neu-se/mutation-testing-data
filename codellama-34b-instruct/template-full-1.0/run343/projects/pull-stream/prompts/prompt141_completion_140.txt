  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, and therefore calling it as one would cause an error. In contrast, `null` is a function, and calling it as one would not cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because `true` is not a function, and therefore calling it as one would cause an error. In contrast, `Math.random` returns a function, and calling it as one would not cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is not a function, and therefore calling it as one would cause an error. In contrast, `Math.random` returns a function, and calling it as one would not cause an error.

DONE.
