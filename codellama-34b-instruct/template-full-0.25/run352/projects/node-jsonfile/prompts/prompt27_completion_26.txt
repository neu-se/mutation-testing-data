  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content, options.reviver, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `1` argument would cause the `JSON.parse()` method to throw a `SyntaxError` because it expects a string as its first argument, but instead receives a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content, options.reviver, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `null` argument would cause the `JSON.parse()` method to throw a `SyntaxError` because it expects a string as its first argument, but instead receives `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content, options.reviver, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `undefined` argument would cause the `JSON.parse()` method to throw a `SyntaxError` because it expects a string as its first argument, but instead receives `undefined`.

DONE.
