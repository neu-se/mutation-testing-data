  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [id]: getCountry(id, options)[0] }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first element of the array returned by `getCountry`, rather than the entire array. This could cause the `reduce` function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [id]: getCountry(id, options).length }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the array returned by `getCountry`, rather than the entire array. This could cause the `reduce` function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [id]: getCountry(id, options)[id] }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the element of the array returned by `getCountry` at the index of `id`, rather than the entire array. This could cause the `reduce` function to return a different result.
