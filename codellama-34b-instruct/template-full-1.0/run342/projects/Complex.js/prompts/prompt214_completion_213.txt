  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative sign would cause the sine function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the square root of a real number might be different from the square root of a complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b+1
```
This would result in different behavior because the +1 would cause the square root to be off by a factor of 10.

DONE.
