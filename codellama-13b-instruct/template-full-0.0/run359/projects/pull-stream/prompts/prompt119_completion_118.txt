  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, acc)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called with the accumulated value `acc` as the second argument, whereas the original code fragment does not pass any arguments to `cb`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called with `null` as the second argument, whereas the original code fragment passes the accumulated value `acc` as the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called with `undefined` as the second argument, whereas the original code fragment passes the accumulated value `acc` as the second argument.

DONE.
