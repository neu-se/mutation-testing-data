  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.length === 0 && err != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `cbs` array is empty and if `err` is not null, while the new code fragment checks if the `cbs` array has a length of 0 and if `err` is not null. The `cbs` array is an array of callback functions, and the `err` variable is an error object. The new code fragment would only execute the callback functions if the `cbs` array is empty and if there is an error.

DONE.
