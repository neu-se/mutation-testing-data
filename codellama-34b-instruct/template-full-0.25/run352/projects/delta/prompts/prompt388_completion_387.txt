  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength` expects a number as an argument, but `length` is an object. This would cause the function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength(other.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because `other.length` is the length of the `other` delta, not the length of the current delta. This would cause the function to return the wrong value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength(this.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.length` is the length of the current delta, not the length of the `other` delta. This would cause the function to return the wrong value.

DONE.
