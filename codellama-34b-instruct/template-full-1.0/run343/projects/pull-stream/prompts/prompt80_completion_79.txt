  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
while(true)
```
This would result in an infinite loop because the `loop` variable is not being updated. In the original code, the `loop` variable is being updated to only be false when `cbed` is true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
loop = false
```
This would result in the loop stopping immediately because the `loop` variable is being set to false. In the original code, the `loop` variable is only being set to false when `cbed` is true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (cbed) break;
```
This would result in the loop stopping when cbed is true, but would still continue to the next iteration when cbed is false. In the original code, the loop only stops when cbed is true.

DONE.
