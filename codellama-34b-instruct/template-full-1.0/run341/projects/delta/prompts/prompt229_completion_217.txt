  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method would return a different value, potentially causing the `new Delta(thisIter.rest())` method to be called with a different range of operations, which may not include the expected operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method would return a different value, potentially causing the `new Delta(thisIter.rest())` method to be called with a different range of operations, which may not include the expected operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.previousLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `previousLength` method would return the length of the previous operation, which may not be the same as the length of the current operation, potentially causing the `new Delta(thisIter.rest())
