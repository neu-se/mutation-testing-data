  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.destroy()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `destroy()` method is called on the read stream, which would cause the stream to be closed and any pending data to be discarded. This could potentially cause the program to crash or behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.pause()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pause()` method is called on the read stream, which would cause the stream to be paused and any pending data to be buffered. This could potentially cause the program to behave differently, as the stream would not be able to read any new data until it is resumed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.resume()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resume()` method is called on the read stream, which would cause the stream to be resumed and any buffered data to be read. This could potentially cause the program to
