 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.denodeify.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` would explicitly set the `this` context to the first argument, while `apply` uses an array for the arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.denodeify.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with the `this` context and arguments pre-specified, which can lead to different behavior depending on how it's used.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.denodeify.prototype
