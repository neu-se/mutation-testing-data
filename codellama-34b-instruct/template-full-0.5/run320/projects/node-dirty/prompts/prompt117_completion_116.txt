  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('read_close', 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a 'read_close' event with a value of 0, which is not the same as emitting the event without any arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('read_close', 'foo');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a 'read_close' event with a value of 'foo', which is not the same as emitting the event without any arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('read_close', this._data.size);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a 'read_close' event with a value of the current size of the data, which is not the same as emitting the event without any arguments.

DONE.
