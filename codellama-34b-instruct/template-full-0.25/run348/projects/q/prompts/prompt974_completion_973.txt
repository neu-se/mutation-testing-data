  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `object` variable, which is likely to be used in the surrounding code. Replacing it with `null` would cause the code to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `object` variable, which is likely to be used in the surrounding code. Replacing it with `undefined` would cause the code to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `object` variable, which is likely to be used in the surrounding code. Replacing it with a string would cause the code to fail or behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
