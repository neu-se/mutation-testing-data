  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(void 0, void 0, progressed)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `progress` callback to be called even if the promise is fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(void 0, void 0, function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `progress` callback to be called even if the promise is rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(void 0, void 0, function (value) {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `progress` callback to be called even if the promise is fulfilled with a value.

DONE.
