  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.split("/");
```
This would result in different behavior because `url.split("/")` would split the URL into an array of substrings, while the original code `url` would return the URL as a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.substring(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because `url.substring(1)` would return the URL without the first character, while the original code `url` would return the URL as a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.slice(-1);
```
This would result in different behavior because `url.slice(-1)` would return the last character of the URL, while the original code `url` would return the URL as a string.

DONE.
