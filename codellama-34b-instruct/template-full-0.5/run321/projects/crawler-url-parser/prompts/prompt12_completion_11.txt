  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses "http://" to replace the "//" at the beginning of the URL, while the modified code uses "https://" which would result in a different protocol and potentially different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http://' + currentUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code replaces the "//" at the beginning of the URL with "http://", while the modified code adds "http://" to the beginning of the URL, which would result in a different URL and potentially different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^\/\//, 'https://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses "http://" to replace the "//" at the beginning of the URL, while the modified code uses "https://" which would result in a different protocol and potentially different behavior.
