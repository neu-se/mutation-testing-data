Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.slice(0, w.length - 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` does not modify the original string and can handle negative indices differently, potentially leading to unexpected results when the string length is less than 2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substring(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring` starts from index 2 and goes to the end of the string, which would incorrectly remove the first two characters instead of the last two.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.split('').reverse().join('').substr(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because this code first reverses the string and then takes a substring starting from index 2 of the reversed string, which would not yield the intended pluralization logic.

DONE.
