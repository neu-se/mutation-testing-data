  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a
```
This would result in different behavior because `_a` is the absolute value of `a`, while `_b` is the absolute value of `b`. Using `_a` instead of `_b` would cause the function to return the wrong value in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a + _b
```
This would result in different behavior because `_a + _b` is the sum of the absolute values of `a` and `b`, while `_b` is the absolute value of `b`. Using `_a + _b` instead of `_b` would cause the function to return the wrong value in some cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a - _b
```
This would result in different behavior because `_a - _b` is the difference between the absolute values of `a` and `b`, while `_b` is the absolute value of `b`. Using `_a - _b` instead of `_b` would
