  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `any` function would return `undefined` instead of a rejected promise, which could lead to unexpected results in the code that uses it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `any` function would return `null` instead of a rejected promise, which could lead to unexpected results in the code that uses it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `any` function would return a rejected promise, which could lead to unexpected results in the code that uses it.

DONE.
