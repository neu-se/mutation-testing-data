  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the boolean value of `this['isInfinite']`, so the resulting expression would be `true` if `this['isInfinite']` is `false`, and `false` if `this['isInfinite']` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `()` operator would call the `this['isInfinite']` function, which may or may not exist, and could potentially cause an error if it does not exist.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add the value `1` to the result of `this['isInfinite']`, which could potentially change the result of the expression.

DONE.
