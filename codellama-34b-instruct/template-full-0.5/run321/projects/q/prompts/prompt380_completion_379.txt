  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the number `1`, which is not a promise and does not have a `then` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"string"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the string `"string"`, which is not a promise and does not have a `then` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the null value `null`, which is not a promise and does not have a `then` method.

DONE.
