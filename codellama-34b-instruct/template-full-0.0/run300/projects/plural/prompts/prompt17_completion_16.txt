  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/x$|ch$|s$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now case-sensitive, so it would not match words that end with "ch" or "s" in lowercase.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/x$|ch$|s$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now case-insensitive, so it would match words that end with "ch" or "s" in any case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/x$|ch$|s$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now case-sensitive and case-insensitive at the same time, which is not
