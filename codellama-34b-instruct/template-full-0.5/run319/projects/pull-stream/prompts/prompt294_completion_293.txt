  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
last ? terminate(cb) : cb(ended)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `last` variable is now being checked before calling `cb`, which would cause the function to return a different value in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
last ? cb(null, data) : terminate(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `last` variable is now being checked before calling `terminate`, which would cause the function to return a different value in some cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
last ? cb(ended) : terminate(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ended` variable is now being passed to `cb` instead of `null`, which would cause the function to return a different value in some cases.

DONE.
