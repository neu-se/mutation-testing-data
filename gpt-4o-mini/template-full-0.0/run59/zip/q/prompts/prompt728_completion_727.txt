Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(promises);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the array of promises instead of resolving it, leading to a failure in the promise chain when all promises are fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(promises.length);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with the count of promises instead of the array of resolved values, which changes the expected output of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(promises[0]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with only the first promise's value instead of the array of all resolved values, potentially losing important results from the other promises.

DONE.
