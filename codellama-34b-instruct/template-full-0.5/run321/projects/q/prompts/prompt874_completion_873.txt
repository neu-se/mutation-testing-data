  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.resolve("foo")
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer.resolve("foo")` would resolve the deferred promise with the value "foo" instead of resolving it with the result of the `callback` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.reject("bar")
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer.reject("bar")` would reject the deferred promise with the value "bar" instead of resolving it with the result of the `callback` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.notify("baz")
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer.notify("baz")` would notify the deferred promise with the value "baz" instead of resolving it with the result of the `callback` function.

DONE.
