  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
runSingle(task, domain);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the task to be executed twice, which could lead to unexpected side effects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
runSingle(task, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the task to be executed with a null domain, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the task.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
runSingle(noop, domain);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the noop function to be executed with the domain, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the noop function.

DONE.
