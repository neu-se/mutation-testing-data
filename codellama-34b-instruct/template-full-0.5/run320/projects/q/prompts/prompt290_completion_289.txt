  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would reject the promise instead of resolving it, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` would notify the progress listeners instead of resolving the promise, which would cause the promise to be in a pending state instead of being resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.fulfill
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.fulfill` would fulfill the promise instead of resolving it, which would cause the promise to be fulfilled instead of resolved.

DONE.
