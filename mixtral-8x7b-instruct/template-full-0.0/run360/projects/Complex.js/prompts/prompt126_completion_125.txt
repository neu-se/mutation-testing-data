 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `this.isInfinite` property exists and is truthy, while the modified code invokes the `isInfinite` method, potentially changing the behavior based on the method's return value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Number.isInteger(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the modified code checks if `this` is an integer, which is not the same as checking if `this` is infinite. This would lead to incorrect results when the input is an integer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.prototype.toString.call(this) === '[object Infinity]'
```
This would result in different behavior because the modified code checks if `this` is of the `Infinity` type using the `toString` method, which is not the same as checking if `this` is infinite
