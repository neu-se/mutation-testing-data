  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r - a
```
This would result in different behavior because `r - a` is equal to `0` when `a` is equal to `r`, which is not the case for `2.0 * (r + a)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r - a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would result in a negative value when `r` is greater than `a`, which is not the case for `2.0 * (r + a)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(r + a) * 2.0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would result in a different value when `r` is not equal to `-a`, which is not the case for `2.0 * (r + a)`.

DONE.
