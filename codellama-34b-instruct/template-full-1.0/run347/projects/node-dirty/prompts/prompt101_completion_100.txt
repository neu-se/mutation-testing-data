  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also consider `null` values as non-existent, whereas the original code fragment only considers `undefined` values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!row.val
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also consider other falsey values (such as `0`, `""`, and `NaN`) as non-existent, whereas the original code fragment only considers `undefined` values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val === void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also consider other non-existent values (such as `undefined` and `null`) as non-existent, whereas the original code fragment only considers `undefined` values.

DONE.
