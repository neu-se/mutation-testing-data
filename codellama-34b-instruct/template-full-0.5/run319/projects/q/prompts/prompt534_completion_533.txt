  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, and would cause an error when `rejected` is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, and would cause an error when `rejected` is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty function would be called instead of `rejected`, and would not have the same effect on the program.

DONE.
