  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `any` function would only reject if all promises are rejected, instead of rejecting if any promise is rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount < promises.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `any` function would only reject if all promises are rejected, instead of rejecting if any promise is rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount % promises.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `any` function would only reject if all promises are rejected, instead of rejecting if any promise is rejected.

DONE.
