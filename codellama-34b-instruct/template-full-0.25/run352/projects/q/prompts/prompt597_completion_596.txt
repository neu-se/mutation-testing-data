  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch.bind(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with the `this` value bound to `object`, which would cause the `dispatch` method to be called on `object` instead of `Q(object)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch.call(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` calls the `dispatch` method on `object` with `Q(object)` as the `this` value, which would cause the `dispatch` method to be called on `object` instead of `Q(object)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch.apply(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` calls the `dispatch` method on `object` with `Q(object)` as the `this` value and an empty argument list, which would cause the `dispatch` method to be called on
