  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    !this
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` keyword refers to the object the method is called on, and negating it would return a falsy value when the objects are equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    'this.ops === another.ops'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would not be checking whether the two objects are equal, but rather whether the string `this.ops === another.ops` is equal to the string being tested.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    'this.ops === another.ops2'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would not be checking whether the two objects are equal, but rather whether the string `this.ops === another.ops2` is equal to the string being tested.

DONE.
