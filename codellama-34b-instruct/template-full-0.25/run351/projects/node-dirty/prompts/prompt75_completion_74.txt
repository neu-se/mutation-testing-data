  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `'load'` event is emitted when the database is loaded, while the `'error'` event is emitted when there is an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `'load'` event is emitted when the database is loaded, while the `'close'` event is emitted when the database is closed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `'load'` event is emitted when the database is loaded, while the `'drain'` event is emitted when the write stream is drained.

DONE.
