  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw "error"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to reject with an "error" value, instead of resolving with the expected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to resolve to null, instead of resolving with the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject("error")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to reject with an "error" value, instead of resolving with the expected value.

DONE.
