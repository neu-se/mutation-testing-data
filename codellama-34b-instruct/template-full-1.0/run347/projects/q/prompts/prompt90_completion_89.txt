  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis([][0]())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call a different function than uncurryThis, which is intentional.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis(![][0]())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the negation of uncurryThis, which is not intentional.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis(() => { return 1; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call an anonymous function that returns 1, which is not intentional.

DONE.
