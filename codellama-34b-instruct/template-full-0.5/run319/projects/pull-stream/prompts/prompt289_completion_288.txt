  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!unique
```
This would result in different behavior because `!unique` is the logical negation of `unique`, which means it will return `false` when `unique` returns `true`, and vice versa. This change would cause the `nonUnique` function to return the opposite result as the original code, which could potentially break the code that relies on it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unique + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `unique + 1` is a different value than `unique`. This change would cause the `nonUnique` function to return a different result than the original code, which could potentially break the code that relies on it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unique * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `unique * 2` is a different value than `unique`. This change would cause the `nonUnique` function to return a different result than the original code, which could
