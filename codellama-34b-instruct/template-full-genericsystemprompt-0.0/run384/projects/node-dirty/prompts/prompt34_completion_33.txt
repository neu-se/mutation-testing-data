  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the callback function `cb` if it is defined, while the new code fragment does not call the callback function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the callback function `cb` if it is defined, while the new code fragment does not call the callback function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the callback function `cb` if it is defined, while the new code fragment calls an empty function instead.

DONE.
