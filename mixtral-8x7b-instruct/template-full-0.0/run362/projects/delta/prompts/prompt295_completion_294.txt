 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always try to access the previous operation, which could cause an error or unexpected results if the iterator is at the beginning of the operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the behavior of the `indexOf` method, which would always return -1, causing the line to be treated as a new line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
iter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the current operation instead of the next one, which could cause an error or unexpected results if the current operation is not an insert operation.

DONE.
