  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `Q` would cause the promise to be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve(1)` would cause the promise to be resolved with the value `1`, whereas `Q` would cause the promise to be resolved with the value `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(Q.reject())
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve(Q.reject())` would cause the promise to be resolved with a rejected promise, whereas `Q` would cause the promise to be resolved with a resolved promise.

DONE.
