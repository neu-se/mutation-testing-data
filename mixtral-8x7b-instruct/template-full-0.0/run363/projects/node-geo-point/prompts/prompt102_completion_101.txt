 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
180/Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `rad2deg` function converts radians to degrees, while this replacement simply divides the longitude value by Ï€ and then multiplies it by 180, which would give incorrect results for the longitude value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan(longitude / latitude) * 180 / Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `rad2deg` function is not dependent on the latitude value, while this replacement is, which would give incorrect results for the longitude value when the latitude value is not equal to 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.asin(longitude) * 180 / Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `rad2deg` function converts radians to degrees, while
