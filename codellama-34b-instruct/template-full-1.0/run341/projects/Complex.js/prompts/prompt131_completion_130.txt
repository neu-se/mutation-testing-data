  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is now being negated, causing the resulting value to be the opposite of what it would be with the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite` method checks if a value is a finite number, whereas `isInfinite` checks if a value is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` method checks if a value is not a number, whereas `isInfinite` checks if a value is infinite.

DONE.
