  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the function's argument instead of a boolean value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the for loop's iteration variable instead of a boolean value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line[j]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the character at index j of the line array instead of a boolean value.

DONE.
