  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const placeholder = () => console.log('Hello World')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls the `sinh` method, which is not a function that exists in JavaScript. By replacing it with the `placeholder` function, the code would now log "Hello World" to the console.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const placeholder = () => Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls the `sinh` method with the value of `b`, but the new code calls `Math.sin` with the value of `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const placeholder = () => -Math.cos(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls the `sinh` method with the value of `b`, but the new code calls `Math.sin` with the negative value of `b`.

DONE.
