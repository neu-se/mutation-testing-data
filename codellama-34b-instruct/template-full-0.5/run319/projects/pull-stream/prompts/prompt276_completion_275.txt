  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream()
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextStream()` would be called immediately, rather than being called conditionally based on the value of `_read`. This could result in an infinite loop, as `nextStream()` would continue to call `read()` with a `null` value for `stream`, causing the `nextStream()` function to be called again.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextChunk()
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextChunk()` would be called immediately, rather than being called conditionally based on the value of `_read`. This could result in an infinite loop, as `nextChunk()` would continue to call `read()` with a `null` value for `data`, causing the `nextChunk()` function to be called again.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(null, function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `read()` would be called with a `null` value for
