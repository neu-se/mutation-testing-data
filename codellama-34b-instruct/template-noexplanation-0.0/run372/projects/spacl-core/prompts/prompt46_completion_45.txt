  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/)

This code fragment is similar to the original code fragment, but it uses a different regular expression to match the path specification. The regular expression `/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/` matches any string that contains only letters, digits, and the following special characters: `_`, `/`, `:`, `~`, `.`, `$`, `+`, `*`, `-`. This regular expression is more restrictive than the original one, which allows for a wider range of characters.
