  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for write permission instead of read permission.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, fs.constants.X_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for execute permission instead of read permission.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, fs.constants.F_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for the existence of the file instead of read permission.

DONE.
