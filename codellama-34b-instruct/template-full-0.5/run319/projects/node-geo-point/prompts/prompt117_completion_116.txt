  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a GeoPoint object, but null is not a GeoPoint object and would cause a type error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new GeoPoint(0, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects the GeoPoint object to have the same latitude and longitude as the current object, but the new GeoPoint object has latitude and longitude of 0, which would cause the calculation to produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects the GeoPoint object to have the same latitude and longitude as the current object, but the new GeoPoint object has the same longitude as the current object, which would cause the calculation to produce incorrect results.

DONE.
