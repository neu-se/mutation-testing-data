  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chillis'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the singular form "chilli," while the new code fragment uses the plural form "chillis."

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chillies'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the singular form "chilli," while the new code fragment uses the plural form "chillies."

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chill'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the singular form "chilli," while the new code fragment uses the singular form "chill."

DONE.
