 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would now return a result when the exponent is a complex number with a non-zero imaginary part, whereas the original code fragment only calculates the power when the exponent is a real number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only calculate the power when the real part of the exponent is zero, whereas the original code fragment calculates the power for any real or complex exponent.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return a result when the imaginary part of the exponent is positive, whereas the original code fragment calculates the power for any complex exponent.

DONE.
