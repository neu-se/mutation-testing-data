  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.includes(promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_indexOf` method needs to check every element in the array, which can be computationally expensive, while the `includes` method does not need to do so.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length > 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_indexOf` method checks if the promise is in the unhandledRejections array, while the `length` property checks if the array has any element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.includes(promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_indexOf` method checks if the promise is in the unhandledRejections array, while the `includes` method checks if the promise is in the reportedUnhandledRejections array

DONE.
