  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.calculateDestination(this, distance, bearing - 180)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the destination point as if the bearing were 180 degrees different from the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.calculateDestination(this, distance, bearing / 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the destination point as if the bearing were half the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.calculateDestination(this, distance, bearing * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the destination point as if the bearing were double the original value.

DONE.
