  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = reducer(acc, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `reducer` function with the `acc` and `data` arguments, which could produce a different result than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = acc + data
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the `data` value to the `acc` value, which could produce a different result than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = data
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `acc` value to the `data` value, which could produce a different result than the original code.

DONE.
