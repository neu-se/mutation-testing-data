  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(ended)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is called with no arguments, while the new code fragment `cb(ended)` is called with one argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is called with no arguments, while the new code fragment `cb(null)` is called with one argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is called with no arguments, while the new code fragment `cb(true)` is called with one argument.

DONE.
