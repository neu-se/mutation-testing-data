 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / a['abs']
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the sign of the final result when `a['abs']` is negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns a positive value, even when `a['abs']` is negative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
a['abs'] * a['abs']
```
This would result in different behavior because it squares the absolute value of `a`, which can cause overflow issues.

DONE.
