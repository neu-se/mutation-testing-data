  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
drain.pipe(process.stdout)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` function is not being called, and the output is being piped directly to `process.stdout` instead of being processed by the `drain` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
drain.pipe(process.stderr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` function is not being called, and the output is being piped to `process.stderr` instead of being processed by the `drain` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
drain.pipe(process.stdout, { end: false })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` option is set to `false`, which means that the `drain` function will not be called when the stream ends.

DONE.
