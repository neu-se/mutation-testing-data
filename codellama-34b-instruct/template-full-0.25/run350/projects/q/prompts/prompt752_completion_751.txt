  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection.message
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the message property of the rejection object, which may not be the same as the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the stack trace of the rejection object, which may not be the same as the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection.name
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the name property of the rejection object, which may not be the same as the original code fragment.

DONE.
