  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/b/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/b/` matches a different set of strings than `/a/`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/a|b/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/a|b/` matches a different set of strings than `/a/`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[ab]/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/[ab]/` matches a different set of strings than `/a/`.

DONE.
