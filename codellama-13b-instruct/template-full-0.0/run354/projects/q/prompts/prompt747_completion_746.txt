  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise, onFulfilled, onRejected, onProgress
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `when` function to handle the promise, while the buggy code fragment uses the `when` function directly. This could result in different behavior if the `when` function is implemented differently in the two cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise, onFulfilled, onRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment includes an `onProgress` callback, while the buggy code fragment does not. This could result in different behavior if the `onProgress` callback is used in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise, onFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment includes an `onRejected` callback, while the buggy code fragment does not. This could result in different behavior if the `onRejected
