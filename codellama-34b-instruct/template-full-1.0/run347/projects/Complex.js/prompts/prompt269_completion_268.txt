  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.im
```
This would result in different behavior because it references the "im" property of the current object, rather than the "im" property of the "this" object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.re
```
This would result in different behavior because it references the "re" property of the current object, rather than the "im" property of the "this" object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the "im" property of the "this" object before using it in the calculation.

DONE.
