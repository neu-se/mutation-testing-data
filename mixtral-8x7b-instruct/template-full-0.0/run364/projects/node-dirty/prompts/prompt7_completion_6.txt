 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'0'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would not be able to differentiate between setting a value to `0` or `undefined`, leading to potential data loss.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would not be able to differentiate between setting a value to `null` or removing it, leading to potential data loss or inconsistencies.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._data
```
This would result in different behavior because it would overwrite the entire `_data` map with a single value, potentially causing data loss or unexpected behavior in other methods that rely on the map structure.

DONE.
