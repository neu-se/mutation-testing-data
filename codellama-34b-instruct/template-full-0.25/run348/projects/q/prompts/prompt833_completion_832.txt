  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` function would not be called, and the promise would not be resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` function would not be called, and the promise would not be resolved or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` function would be called with the argument `0`, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
