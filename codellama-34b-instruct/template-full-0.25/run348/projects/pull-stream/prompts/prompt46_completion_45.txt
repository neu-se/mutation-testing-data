  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from 0 instead of 1, which could cause the function to skip the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from the last argument instead of the first, which could cause the function to process the arguments in reverse order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = Math.floor(Math.random() * length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from a random index instead of the first argument, which could cause the function to process the arguments in a random order.

DONE.
