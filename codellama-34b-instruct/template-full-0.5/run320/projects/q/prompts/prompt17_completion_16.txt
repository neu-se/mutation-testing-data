  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a function definition, and this replacement would cause the code to return the value 2 instead of the function definition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"string"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a function definition, and this replacement would cause the code to return the string "string" instead of the function definition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a function definition, and this replacement would cause the code to return null instead of the function definition.

DONE.
