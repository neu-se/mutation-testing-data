  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops != null && Array.isArray(ops)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ops` variable is no longer checked to have an `ops` property that is an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops != null && Array.isArray(ops.ops) && ops.ops.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ops` variable is now also checked to have a non-empty `ops` property that is an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops != null && Array.isArray(ops.ops) && ops.ops.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ops` variable is now also checked to have an empty `ops` property that is an array.

DONE.
