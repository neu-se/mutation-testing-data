  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push(otherOp).delete(opLength);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` method is being called on the `otherOp` object, which is not the intended behavior. The `delete` method should be called on the `retDelta` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push(otherOp).retain(opLength);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` method is being called on the `otherOp` object, which is not the intended behavior. The `retain` method should be called on the `retDelta` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push(otherOp).insert(opLength);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` method is being called on the `otherOp` object, which is not the intended behavior. The `insert` method should be called on the `retDelta` object.
