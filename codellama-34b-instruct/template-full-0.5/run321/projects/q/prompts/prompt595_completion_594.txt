  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first argument of the `args` array to the `callback` function, instead of passing the entire `args` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass all the arguments of the `args` array except the first one to the `callback` function, instead of passing the entire `args` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `args` array concatenated with the number 1 to the `callback` function, instead of passing the entire `args` array.

DONE.
