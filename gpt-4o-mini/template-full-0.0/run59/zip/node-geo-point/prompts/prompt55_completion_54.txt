Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the latitude of the starting point instead of the destination point, which would lead to incorrect calculations for the bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the latitude of the destination point to zero, which would not accurately reflect the intended destination and could lead to incorrect bearing calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1 + φ2
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly combines the latitudes of both points, which would distort the bearing calculation and yield an incorrect result.

DONE.
