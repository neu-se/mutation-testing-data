  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbs.slice()` creates a new array containing the same elements as `cbs`, whereas `cbs` itself is a reference to the original array. If the test suite relies on the reference to the original array being maintained, it may fail when `cbs.slice()` is used instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.concat([])
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbs.concat([])` creates a new array containing the same elements as `cbs`, whereas `cbs` itself is a reference to the original array. If the test suite relies on the reference to the original array being maintained, it may fail when `cbs.concat([])` is used instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.filter(() => true)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbs.filter(() => true)` creates a new
