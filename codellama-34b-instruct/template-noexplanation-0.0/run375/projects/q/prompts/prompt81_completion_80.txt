  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.unshift
```
This will cause the task to be added to the beginning of the queue instead of the end, which may cause the task to be executed earlier than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.pop
```
This will cause the task to be removed from the end of the queue instead of added to the end, which may cause the task to not be executed at all.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.shift
```
This will cause the task to be removed from the beginning of the queue instead of added to the end, which may cause the task to not be executed at all.

DONE.
