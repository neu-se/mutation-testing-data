  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b + b * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the operation `a * b` and `b * a` would be performed, which would result in a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a - b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of `b * b` would change the result of the expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a + 2 * b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of `2 * b * b` would change the result of the expression.

DONE.
