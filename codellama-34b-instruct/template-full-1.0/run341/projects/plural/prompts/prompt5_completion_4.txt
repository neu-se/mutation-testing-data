  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is used instead of the `call` method, leading to a different execution context and potential errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Function.prototype.toString.call
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Function` prototype is used instead of the `Object` prototype, leading to a different method being called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function() { return Object.prototype.toString.call; }).call
```
This would result in different behavior because a new function is created and its `call` method is used instead of the `Object.prototype.toString.call` method, leading to a different execution context and potential errors.

DONE.
