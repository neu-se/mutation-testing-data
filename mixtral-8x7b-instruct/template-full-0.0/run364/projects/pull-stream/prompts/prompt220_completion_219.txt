 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the data as the first argument to the callback instead of the expected error or null. This could cause issues downstream if the callback is not designed to handle data in that position.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass true as the first argument to the callback instead of the expected error or null. This could cause issues downstream if the callback is not designed to handle boolean values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { throw new Error('Something went wrong') }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error instead of passing the expected error or null to the callback. This could cause the application to crash or behave unexpectedly if the error is not handled properly.

DONE.
