Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.unshift(item)
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds the item to the beginning of the array instead of the end, changing the order of elements in the resulting array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.push(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes a `null` value into the array every time, regardless of the actual `item`, leading to an array filled with `null` values instead of the intended items.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr = [item]
```
This would result in different behavior because it reassigns `arr` to a new array containing only the current `item`, effectively discarding all previously accumulated items in the array.

DONE.
