  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be passed as the context to the `rule.query()` method, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as the context to the `rule.query()` method, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty string would be passed as the context to the `rule.query()` method, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
