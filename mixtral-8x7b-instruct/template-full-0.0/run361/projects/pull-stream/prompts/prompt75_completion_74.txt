 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done && function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the buggy fragment only calls the callback if `done` is truthy, whereas the original fragment always calls the callback (either `done` or an empty function).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { throw new Error('Bang!') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the buggy fragment throws an error, whereas the original fragment calls the callback without throwing an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the buggy fragment passes `null` as an argument to `read`, whereas the original fragment passes either `done` or an empty function.

DONE.
