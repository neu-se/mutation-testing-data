  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src !== targetBasePath
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the source and target folders to be different, which is not the intended behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath !== src
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the target folder to be different from the source folder, which is not the intended behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath === src
```
This would result in no change in behavior, as it is the original code fragment.

DONE.
