Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filename, 'w'
```
This would result in different behavior because the file would be opened in write mode instead of read mode, potentially leading to unexpected changes to the file's contents if the rest of the code doesn't account for this difference.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filename, 'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the file would be opened in append mode, allowing writes to the end of the file but potentially causing issues if the code expects to read or overwrite the file's contents.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filename + '.tmp', 'r'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would attempt to open a different file (one with a `.tmp` extension) instead of the intended file, potentially leading to errors if the `.tmp` file doesn't exist or if its contents are not what the code expects.

DONE.
