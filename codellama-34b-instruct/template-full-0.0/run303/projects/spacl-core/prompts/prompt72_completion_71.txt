  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` method would return `null` instead of the expected `true` or `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` method would return the opposite of the expected result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.path
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` method would use the `path` property of the `ctx` object instead of the `ctx` object itself.

DONE.
