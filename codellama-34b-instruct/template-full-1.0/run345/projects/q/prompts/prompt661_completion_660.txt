  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"put"
```
This would result in different behavior because "put" is a different HTTP method than "post", and the API may not handle it correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"postx"
```
This would result in different behavior because "postx" is not a valid HTTP method, and the API may not handle it correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because Math.random() returns a random number between 0 and 1, and the API may not handle it correctly.

DONE.
