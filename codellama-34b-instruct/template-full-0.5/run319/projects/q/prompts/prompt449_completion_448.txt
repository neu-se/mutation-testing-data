  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejection` is not a promise, so it would not have an `inspect()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a promise, so it would not have an `inspect()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejected` is not a promise, so it would not have an `inspect()` method.

DONE.
