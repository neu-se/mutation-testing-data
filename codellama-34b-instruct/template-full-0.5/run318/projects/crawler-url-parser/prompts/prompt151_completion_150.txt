  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different behavior than the original code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.host == pageurl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because the `host` property is compared in the opposite direction, which could cause the `gettype` function to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.host.length == pageurl.host.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of the `host` string is compared, which could cause the `gettype` function to return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.host.toLowerCase() == pageurl.host.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method is called on the `host` string, which could cause the `gettype` function to return incorrect results.
