  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the promise is rejected, but by replacing it with `null`, the code will always return `true` and the `untrackRejection` function will never be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the promise is rejected, but by replacing it with `undefined`, the code will always return `true` and the `untrackRejection` function will never be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the promise is rejected, but by replacing it with a resolved promise, the code will always return `false` and the `untrackRejection` function will never be called.

DONE.
