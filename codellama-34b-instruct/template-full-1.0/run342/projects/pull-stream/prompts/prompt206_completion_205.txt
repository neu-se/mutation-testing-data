  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```aborted()
```
This would result in different behavior because `aborted` is a boolean variable and `aborted()` would attempt to call it as a function, which would result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```!aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because `!aborted` would negate the boolean value of `aborted`, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to a different branch.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` would not pass the `if` statement condition, potentially causing the function to return a different value or take a different path.

DONE.
