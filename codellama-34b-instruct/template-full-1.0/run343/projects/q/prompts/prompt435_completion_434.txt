  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process === "undefined" || typeof process.emit !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because `process` is a global object in Node.js, and `process.emit` is a method that emits an event to the event loop. If `process` is undefined or `process.emit` is not a function, it would result in an error, which could lead to different behavior than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process === "number" || typeof process.emit !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof process` is `"object"` in Node.js, and `process.emit` is a method that emits an event to the event loop. If `process` is a number or `process.emit` is not a function, it would result in an error, which could lead to different behavior than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process === "string
