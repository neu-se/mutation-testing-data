  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all` expects an array of promises, while `Q` is a function that returns a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q` is a function that returns a promise, while `Q.all` expects an array of promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` creates a rejected promise, while `Q` and `Q.all` create a fulfilled promise.

DONE.
