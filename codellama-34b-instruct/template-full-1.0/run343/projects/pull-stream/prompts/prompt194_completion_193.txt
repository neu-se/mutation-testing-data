  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` was a reference to the callback function, but `cb()` would call the callback function immediately, leading to a different control flow.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` was a reference to the callback function, but `abort` is a boolean variable that indicates whether the source has been aborted or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` was a reference to the callback function, but `undefined` is not a function and would lead to a runtime error when called.

DONE.
