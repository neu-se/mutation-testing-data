  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended === end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the assignment operator (`=`) to set `ended` to `end`, while the new code uses the strict equality operator (`===`) to check if `ended` is equal to `end`. This can cause the `ended` variable to not be updated correctly in some cases, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended ?? end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the assignment operator (`=`) to set `ended` to `end`, while the new code uses the nullish coalescing operator (`??`) to check if `ended` is null or undefined and then set it to `end` if it is. This can cause the `ended` variable to not be updated correctly in some cases, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the assignment operator (`
