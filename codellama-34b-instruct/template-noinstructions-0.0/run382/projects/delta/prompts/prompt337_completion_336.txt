  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex, baseIndex + length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the base delta, which is not the same as the original code fragment `base.slice(baseIndex, baseIndex + 1)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex, baseIndex + 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the base delta that is two characters long, which is not the same as the original code fragment `base.slice(baseIndex, baseIndex + 1)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex, baseIndex + 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the base delta that is three characters long, which is not the same as the original code fragment `base.slice(baseIndex, baseIndex + 1)`.

DONE.
