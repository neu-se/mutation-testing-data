  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id].name, options
```
This would result in different behavior because `countries[id].name` is a string, whereas `countries[id]` is an object. This change would cause the `deliverCountry` function to return a different value, which could potentially break the code that relies on the function's output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] + options
```
This would result in different behavior because `countries[id] + options` would concatenate the `countries[id]` object with the `options` object, whereas `countries[id], options` would return an object with the `countries[id]` object as a property and the `options` object as a property. This change could cause the code that relies on the function's output to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] - options
```
This would result in different behavior because `countries
