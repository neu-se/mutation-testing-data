  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.next()` returns the next value in the iteration, whereas `iter.next` returns the next function in the iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.next(2)` returns the next two values in the iteration, whereas `iter.next` returns the next function in the iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(function() { return 2; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.next(function() { return 2; })` returns the next function in the iteration that returns 2, whereas `iter.next` returns the next function in the iteration.

DONE.
