  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for equality to zero, whereas this code fragment checks if the value is less than zero. This would cause the code to produce different output for inputs that are less than zero, and would therefore be a valid mutation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for equality to zero, whereas this code fragment checks if the value is greater than zero. This would cause the code to produce different output for inputs that are greater than zero, and would therefore be a valid mutation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for equality to zero, whereas this code fragment checks if the value is equal to one. This would cause the code to produce different output for inputs that are equal to one, and would therefore be a valid mutation.

DONE.
