  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNodeJS
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNodeJS` variable is used to determine whether the code is running in a Node.js environment, and the `!` operator negates the value of the variable, causing the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isBrowser
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isBrowser` variable is used to determine whether the code is running in a browser environment, and the code would behave differently if the value of the variable is different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process` variable is only defined in Node.js environments, and the code would behave differently if the variable is undefined.

DONE.
