  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of the values of the object's own enumerable properties, whereas `Object.keys` returns an array of the object's own enumerable property names.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.keys
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.keys` is a function that returns an array of the own enumerable property names of an object, whereas `Object.keys` is a function that returns an array of the own enumerable property names of an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys.call(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys.call(object)` returns an array of the own enumerable property names of `object`, whereas `Object.keys` returns an array of the own enumerable property names of the object on which it is called.

DONE.
