Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because using `this` would refer to the context in which the function is called, potentially leading to unexpected results if the function is invoked in a different context than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because calling `f` with `null` as the context would change the value of `this` inside `f`, which could lead to errors or different outcomes if `f` relies on its context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f.bind(window)
```
This would result in different behavior because binding `f` to the `window` object would change the context of `this` within `f`, which may not be the intended behavior if `f` is designed to operate on a different object.

DONE.
