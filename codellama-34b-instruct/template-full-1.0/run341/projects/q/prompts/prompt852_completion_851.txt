  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
throw new Error();

This would result in different behavior because throw new error would throw an exception regardless of whether the given promise is rejected or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
Q.reject(error);

This would result in different behavior because instead of rejecting the promise with the error message, it would create a new rejected promise with the error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
deferred.reject(error);

This would result in different behavior because instead of rejecting the promise with the error message, it would reject the deferred value with the error message.

DONE.
