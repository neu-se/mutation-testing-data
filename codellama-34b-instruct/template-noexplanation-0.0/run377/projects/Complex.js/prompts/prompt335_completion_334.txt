  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(b, a)
```
This code fragment is a function call to the `Math.atan2` function, which calculates the arctangent of the ratio of its arguments. In this case, the arguments are `b` and `a`, which are the imaginary and real parts of the complex number, respectively. This code fragment is equivalent to the original code fragment, which was `Math.atan2(a, b)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(a, b) + Math.PI
```
This code fragment is a function call to the `Math.atan2` function, which calculates the arctangent of the ratio of its arguments. In this case, the arguments are `a` and `b`, which are the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, respectively. This code fragment is equivalent to the original code fragment, which was `Math.atan2(a, b)`. However, it adds `Math.PI` to the result, which is
