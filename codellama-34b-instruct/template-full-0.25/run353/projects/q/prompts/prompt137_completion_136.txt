  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ReturnValue !== "undefined" && ReturnValue !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator returns a string indicating the type of the operand, while the `!==` operator checks for strict equality. In this case, the `typeof` operator would return the string "undefined" if `ReturnValue` is undefined, which would make the entire expression evaluate to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ReturnValue !== "undefined" || ReturnValue !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is a logical OR operator, which means that the expression will evaluate to `true` if either of the operands is truthy. In this case, if `ReturnValue` is undefined, the `typeof` operator would return the string "undefined", which is a falsy value. However, the `!==` operator would still evaluate to `true` because `ReturnValue` is not strictly equal to `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER
