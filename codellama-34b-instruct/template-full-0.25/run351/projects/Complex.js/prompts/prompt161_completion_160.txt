  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>) && z['isInfinite']()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if both `this` and `z` are infinite, while the new code fragment checks if `this` is infinite and `z` is not infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>) || z['isInfinite']()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if both `this` and `z` are infinite, while the new code fragment checks if `this` is infinite or `z` is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>) && !z['isInfinite']()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if both `this` and `
