  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, whereas `concat` returns a new array consisting of the elements of the original array joined with the elements of one or more additional arrays.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.splice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` removes and replaces elements in an array, whereas `concat` returns a new array consisting of the elements of the original array joined with the elements of one or more additional arrays.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes and returns the last element of an array, whereas `concat` returns a new array consisting of the elements of the original array joined with the elements of one or more additional arrays.

DONE.
