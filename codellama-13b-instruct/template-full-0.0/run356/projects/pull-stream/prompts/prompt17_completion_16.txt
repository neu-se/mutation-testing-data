  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is calling the `pull` function with a variable number of arguments, while the buggy code fragment is calling it with a fixed number of arguments. This could cause the test suite to fail if it is not designed to handle variable argument lists.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3], ref[4])
```
