  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` creates a shallow copy of the array, which means that the new array would have the same elements as the original array, but any changes made to the new array would not affect the original array. In contrast, `this.rules` returns the original array, so any changes made to the new array would also affect the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.filter(rule => rule.matches(path, ctx))
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter()` creates a new array with only the elements that match the given condition, while `this.rules` returns the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.map(rule => rule.clone())
```
This would result in different behavior because `map()` creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the original array, while `this.rules
