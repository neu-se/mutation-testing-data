  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the first string instead of the second string, which is the one being compared to the first string in the diff function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a non-existent string at index 2, which would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[1].toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the first string to the second string in uppercase, which could produce different results than comparing them as-is.

DONE.
