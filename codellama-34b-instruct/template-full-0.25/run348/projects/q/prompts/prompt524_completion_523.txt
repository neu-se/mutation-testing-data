  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `object` is passed as an argument to the `dispatch` function, which is not the case when it is replaced with `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `object` is passed as an argument to the `dispatch` function, which is not the case when it is replaced with `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `object` is passed as an argument to the `dispatch` function, which is not the case when it is replaced with an empty object.

DONE.
