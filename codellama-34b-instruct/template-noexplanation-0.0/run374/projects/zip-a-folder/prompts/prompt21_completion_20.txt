  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath + 'foo'
```
This code fragment will append the string "foo" to the value of `targetFilePath`, which will likely cause the `fs.createWriteStream` method to fail because the resulting file path will not exist.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath.substring(1)
```
This code fragment will remove the first character of the value of `targetFilePath`, which will likely cause the `fs.createWriteStream` method to fail because the resulting file path will not exist.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath.split('/').pop()
```
This code fragment will split the value of `targetFilePath` on the `/` character and return the last element of the resulting array, which will likely cause the `fs.createWriteStream` method to fail because the resulting file path will not exist.

DONE.
