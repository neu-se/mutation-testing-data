  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject, op, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `deferred.resolve` would cause it to be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve, "foo", args
```
This would result in different behavior because `op` would be set to the string "foo", whereas in the original code it is set to the value of `op`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve, op, []
```
This would result in different behavior because `args` would be set to an empty array, whereas in the original code it is set to the value of `args`.

DONE.
