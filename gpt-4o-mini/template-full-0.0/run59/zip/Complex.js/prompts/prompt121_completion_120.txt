Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the current complex number is zero instead of checking if it is infinite, which would lead to incorrect handling of operations involving infinite values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the result of the `isInfinite` check, causing the condition to pass when the number is not infinite, which could lead to incorrect results when adding infinite values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it combines two conditions, checking if the current number is infinite and if the other number is zero, which changes the logic of the addition operation and may not handle cases where both numbers are infinite correctly.

DONE.
