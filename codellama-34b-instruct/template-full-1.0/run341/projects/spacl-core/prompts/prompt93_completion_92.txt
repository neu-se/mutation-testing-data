  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.add(policy.name, policy)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.add()` will add a new entry to the map if the key does not already exist, whereas `this.set()` will overwrite the existing value if the key already exists.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.delete(policy.name)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.delete()` will remove the entry with the specified key from the map, whereas `this.set()` will overwrite the existing value if the key already exists.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.clear()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.clear()` will remove all entries from the map, whereas `this.set()` will overwrite the existing value if the key already exists.

DONE.
