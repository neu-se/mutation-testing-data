Your task is to apply mutation testing to the following code:
```
'use strict'

module.exports = function pull (a) {
  var length = arguments.length
  if (typeof a === 'function' && a.length === 1) {
    var args = new Array(length)
    for(var i = 0; i < length; i++)
      args[i] = arguments[i]
    return function (read) {
      if (args == null) {
        throw new TypeError("partial sink should only be called once!")
      }

      // Grab the reference after the check, because it's always an array now
      // (engines like that kind of consistency).
      var ref = args
      args = null

      // Prioritize common case of small number of pulls.
      switch (length) {
      case 1: return pull(read, ref[0])
      case 2: return pull(read, ref[0], <PLACEHOLDER>)
      case 3: return pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2])
      case 4: return pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3])
      default:
        ref.unshift(read)
        return pull.apply(null, ref)
      }
    }
  }

  var read = a

  if (read && typeof read.source === 'function') {
    read = read.source
  }

  for (var i = 1; i < length; i++) {
    var s = arguments[i]
    if (typeof s === 'function') {
      read = s(read)
    } else if (s && typeof s === 'object') {
      s.sink(read)
      read = s.source
    }
  }

  return read
}

```

by replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different
behavior than the original code fragment, which was:
```
ref[1]
```
Please consider changes such as using different operators, changing constants,
referring to different variables, object properties, functions, or methods.  

Provide three answers as fenced code blocks containing a single line of code,
using the following template:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```

Please conclude your response with "DONE."
