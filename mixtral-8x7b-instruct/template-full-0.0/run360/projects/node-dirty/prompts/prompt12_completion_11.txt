 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'0'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_queue` map would always store an array with a single callback, even if multiple callbacks are passed to the `set` method for the same key. This is because the `cbs.push(cb)` line would not be executed due to the falsy value of `'0'`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.path
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_queue` map would store an array with a single callback for every key, even if multiple callbacks are passed to the `set` method for the same key. This is because the `cbs.push(cb)` line would always be executed, appending the current path to the `cbs` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._data.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_queue` map would
