  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would return a different slice of the `arguments` object, which could lead to unexpected results in the `dispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would return a slice of the `arguments` object that starts at the beginning of the array, rather than starting at the second element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would return a slice of the `arguments` object that ends at the second-to-last element, rather than starting at the second element.

DONE.
