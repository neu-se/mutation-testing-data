  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to a truthy value, even if the array is empty, causing the promise to never be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!messages.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate to a falsy value when the array is empty, causing the promise to never be resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new array, causing the reference to the original array to be lost, which could cause the promise to never be resolved.

DONE.
