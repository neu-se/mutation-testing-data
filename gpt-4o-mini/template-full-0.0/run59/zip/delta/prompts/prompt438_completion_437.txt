Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `nextOp.retain` is a string instead of a number, which would cause the code to skip the case where `nextOp.retain` is a number, potentially leading to incorrect operations being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.retain === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `nextOp.retain` is undefined, which would cause the code to not execute the block that assigns `retOp.retain`, leading to a missing `retain` property in the returned operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.retain > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `nextOp.retain` is greater than zero, which would incorrectly filter out valid `retain` values that are zero, potentially causing the method to return an operation that does not reflect the intended behavior.

DONE.
