  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result
```
This would result in different behavior because `result` is a promise, and `result.value` is a resolved value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise` is a promise, and `result.value` is a resolved value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"result"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"result"` is a string, and `result.value` is a resolved value.

DONE.
