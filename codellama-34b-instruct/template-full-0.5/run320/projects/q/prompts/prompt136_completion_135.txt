  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.message
```
This would result in different behavior because `exception.message` is a string, while `exception` is an object, and the `object_toString` function is designed to handle objects, not strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because `exception.stack` is a string, while `exception` is an object, and the `object_toString` function is designed to handle objects, not strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because `exception.prototype` is an object, while `exception` is a function, and the `object_toString` function is designed to handle functions, not objects.

DONE.
