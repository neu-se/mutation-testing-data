  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength()` method returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, and if the length is greater than 1, it would prevent the `otherOp` variable from being set to `undefined`, which could cause the `Delta` constructor to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength()` method returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, and if the length is greater than 1, it would cause the `otherOp` variable to be set to `undefined`, which could cause the `Delta` constructor to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength()` method returns the length of the next operation in the iterator
