  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was expecting a non-null value for `object`, but `null` would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was expecting a defined `object`, but `undefined` would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
5
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was expecting a string or symbol for `object`, but `5` is a number and would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

DONE.
