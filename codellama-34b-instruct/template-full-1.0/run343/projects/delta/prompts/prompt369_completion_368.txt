  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for both 'insert' and 'delete' types, while this code fragment only checks for 'delete'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisData !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the type of `otherData` to be 'object', while this code fragment checks for the type of `thisData` to be a primitive value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain > otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for equality between `thisOp.retain` and `otherOp.retain`, while this code fragment checks for the value of `thisOp.retain` to be greater than `otherOp.retain`.

DONE.
