  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would replace all occurrences of "\n" with EOL, while the new code fragment would replace all occurrences of "\n" with a single space.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"<br>"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would replace all occurrences of "\n" with EOL, while the new code fragment would replace all occurrences of "\n" with a line break.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"<p>"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would replace all occurrences of "\n" with EOL, while the new code fragment would replace all occurrences of "\n" with a paragraph break.

DONE.
