  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'], this['im']
```
This change swaps the order of the arguments to `Math.atan2`, which is a common mistake that can cause the function to return an incorrect value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] + this['re']
```
This change adds the real and imaginary parts of the complex number together, which is a common mistake that can cause the function to return an incorrect value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * this['re']
```
This change multiplies the real and imaginary parts of the complex number together, which is a common mistake that can cause the function to return an incorrect value.

DONE.
