  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.stackCounter = longStackCounter--;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `longStackCounter` would be decremented instead of incremented, which would cause the stack trace to be shorter than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.stackCounter = longStackCounter + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `longStackCounter` would be incremented by 1 instead of being set to the current value, which would cause the stack trace to be longer than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.stackCounter = longStackCounter * 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `longStackCounter` would be multiplied by 2 instead of being set to the current value, which would cause the stack trace to be twice as long as expected.

DONE.
