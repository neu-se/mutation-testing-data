 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Function.prototype.apply.bind(Array.prototype.slice)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use `Function.prototype.apply` to bind `Array.prototype.slice` instead of directly passing the `array_slice` function. This could lead to issues if the context (`this`) is important for the `slice` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the `slice` method directly from the array literal, which might not have the same context as the original `array_slice` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.floor.bind(Array.prototype, 'slice')
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `Function.prototype.bind` to bind `Math.floor` to `Array.prototype` and then access the `slice` method. This is clearly not the same as the original
