Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.delete(iter.next());
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of pushing the current operation to the `line`, it attempts to delete the operation, which would alter the contents of `line` unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.push(new Delta());
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes a new empty `Delta` object to `line` instead of the current operation, effectively losing the actual operation data that should have been added.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.retain(iter.next().retain);
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to retain the length of the next operation instead of pushing the operation itself, which would change the intended operation handling in the `eachLine` method.

DONE.
