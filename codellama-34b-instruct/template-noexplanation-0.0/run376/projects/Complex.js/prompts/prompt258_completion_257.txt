  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0 && b === 0
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but with the conditions reversed. It will still return the same result as the original code fragment for the same input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0 || b === 0
```
This code fragment is different from the original, as it will return `true` if either `a` is greater than 0 or `b` is equal to 0. This may cause the function to return a different result than the original code fragment for certain input values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0 && b !== 0
```
This code fragment is different from the original, as it will return `true` if `a` is greater than 0 and `b` is not equal to 0. This may cause the function to return a different result than the original code fragment for certain input values.

DONE.
