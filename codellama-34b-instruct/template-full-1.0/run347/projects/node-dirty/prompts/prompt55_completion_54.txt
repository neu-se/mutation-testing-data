  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'overflow'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'overflow' is not a recognized event by the 'drain' event emitter, and the code would not execute the expected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'wrong'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'wrong' is not a recognized event by the 'drain' event emitter, and the code would not execute the expected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'something'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'something' is not a recognized event by the 'drain' event emitter, and the code would not execute the expected behavior.

DONE.
