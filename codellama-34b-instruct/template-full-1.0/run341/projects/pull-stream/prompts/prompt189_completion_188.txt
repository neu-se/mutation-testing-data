  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, array[i++]
```
This would result in different behavior because `abort` would become an array instead of a boolean value, causing the `abortCb` function to be called with an unexpected argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, array[i--]
```
This would result in different behavior because `i` would be decremented instead of incremented, causing the array to be iterated in reverse order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length, array[i]
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.length` would be passed as the first argument to `abortCb`, causing the function to be called with an unexpected argument.

DONE.
