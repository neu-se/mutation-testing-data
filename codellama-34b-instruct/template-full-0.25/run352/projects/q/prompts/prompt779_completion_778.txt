  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() {
    throw new Error("Intentional error");
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with an error, whereas the original code would resolve the promise with the value of `promise.inspect()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() {
    return Q.reject("Intentional rejection");
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the string "Intentional rejection", whereas the original code would resolve the promise with the value of `promise.inspect()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() {
    return Q.resolve("Intentional resolution");
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the string "Intentional resolution", whereas the original code would resolve the promise with the value of `prom
