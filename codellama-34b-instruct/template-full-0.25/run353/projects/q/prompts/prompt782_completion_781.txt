  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
regardless, regardless
```
This would result in different behavior because the `regardless` function would be called twice, which could cause unexpected side effects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
noop, noop
```
This would result in different behavior because the `noop` function would be called twice, which could cause unexpected side effects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return; }, function () { return; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the anonymous functions would be called twice, which could cause unexpected side effects.

DONE.
