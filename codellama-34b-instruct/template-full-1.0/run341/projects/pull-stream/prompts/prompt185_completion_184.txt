  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `true` if the input array is empty, but this modified code fragment returns `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `true` if the input array is not empty, but this modified code fragment returns the opposite value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!array.includes(array[i])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `null` if the input array does not contain the current value, but this modified code fragment returns the opposite value.

DONE.
