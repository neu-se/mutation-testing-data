  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `onRejected` is a function that handles the rejection of a promise, while `onFulfilled` is a function that handles the fulfillment of a promise. Using `onRejected` instead of `onFulfilled` would cause the promise to be rejected, even if it was previously fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

Using `onProgress` instead of `onFulfilled` would cause the promise to be in a pending state, even if it was previously fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
noop
```
This would result in different behavior because `noop` is a function that does nothing, while `onFulfilled
