 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
eval(Object.keys)

This would result in different behavior because `eval` can execute arbitrary code, which can lead to unintended side effects or security vulnerabilities.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.getOwnPropertyNames
