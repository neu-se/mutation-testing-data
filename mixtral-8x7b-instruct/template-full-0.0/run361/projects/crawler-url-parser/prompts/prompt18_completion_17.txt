 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` condition would always evaluate to `false`, and the `baseUrlStr` would not be replaced when the `currentUrlStr` does not start with `http://` or `//`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` condition would throw a `TypeError` when `currentUrlStr` is not `null` or `undefined`, and `baseUrlStr` is `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, true).host
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` condition would check if the `host` property of the `parsedUrl` object is not `null`, instead of checking if the `host` property exists. This could lead to unexpected behavior when `currentUrlStr` is a relative URL.

DONE.
