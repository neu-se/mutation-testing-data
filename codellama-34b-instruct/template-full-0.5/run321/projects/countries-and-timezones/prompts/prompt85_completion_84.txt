  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.deprecated` is not the same as `options`, and would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = true
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.deprecated = true` would cause the function to return a different value than `options.deprecated = false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = !options.deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.deprecated = !options.deprecated` would cause the function to return a different value than `options.deprecated = false`.

DONE.
