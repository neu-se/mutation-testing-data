  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```not true```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return null, regardless of the input URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```false```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return the original URL, regardless of any changes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```parsedUrl.protocol === 'https:'```
This would result in different behavior because the function would only return the URL if the protocol is HTTPS, regardless of the input URL.

DONE.
