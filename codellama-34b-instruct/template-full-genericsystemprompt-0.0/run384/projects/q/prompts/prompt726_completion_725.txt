  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises[index] = snapshot.value;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the resolved value of the promise to the `promises` array, rather than the promise itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises[index] = promise;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the original promise to the `promises` array, rather than the resolved value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises[index] = Q.resolve(snapshot.value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that resolves to the resolved value of the original promise, rather than the original promise itself.

DONE.
