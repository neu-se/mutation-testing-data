  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws an exception, while the new code fragment returns null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws an exception, while the new code fragment returns undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("PLACEHOLDER")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws an exception, while the new code fragment throws a new error with the message "PLACEHOLDER".

DONE.
