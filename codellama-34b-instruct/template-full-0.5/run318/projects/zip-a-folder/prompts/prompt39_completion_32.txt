  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',').forEach((globPart) => {
  zipArchive.glob(globPart);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method returns an array of substrings, whereas the original code fragment only returns a single string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.replace(',', '');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace()` method replaces all occurrences of the first argument with the second argument, whereas the original code fragment only replaces the first occurrence.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.substring(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring()` method returns a substring from the specified start index to the end of the string, whereas the original code fragment only returns a substring from the specified start index to the end of the string.

DONE.
