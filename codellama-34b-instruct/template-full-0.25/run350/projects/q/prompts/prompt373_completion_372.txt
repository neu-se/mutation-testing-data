  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror(e)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.onerror` is a function that is called when an error occurs, but it is not being called in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror(e, promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.onerror` is a function that is called when an error occurs, but it is not being called in the original code. Additionally, the `promise` parameter is not being passed to the function in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror(e, promise, deferred)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.onerror` is a function that is called when an error occurs, but it is not being called in the original code. Additionally, the `promise` and `deferred` parameters are not being passed to the function in the original code.
