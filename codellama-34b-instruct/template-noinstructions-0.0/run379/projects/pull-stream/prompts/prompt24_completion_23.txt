  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ref[1]` was replaced with `ref[2]`, which would cause the function to use the wrong argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ref[1]` was replaced with `ref[0]`, which would cause the function to use the wrong argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ref[1]` was replaced with `ref[length - 1]`, which would cause the function to use the wrong argument.

DONE.
