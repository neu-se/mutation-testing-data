 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` function is no longer passed as the `onFulfilled` handler for the `then` method. Instead, `undefined` is passed, which would cause an error when the `then` method attempts to call it with arguments `(value, reject, notify)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
