  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the peek type is checked to be not 'insert', in this option it is checked to be 'delete' which could result in different behavior if the peek type is not 'delete'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the peek length is checked to be less than or equal to zero, in this option it is checked to be greater than zero which could result in different behavior if the peek length is greater than zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasNext() === false
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the hasNext method is not called, in this option it is called and checked to be false which could result in different behavior if the iterator has no next element.

DONE.
