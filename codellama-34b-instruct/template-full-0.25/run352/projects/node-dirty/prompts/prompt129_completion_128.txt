  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork(false);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cork` method is called with a boolean value of `false`, which would cause the stream to be uncorked immediately, rather than waiting for the `'drain'` event to be emitted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork(this._queue.size);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cork` method is called with the size of the `_queue` object, which would cause the stream to be uncorked only when the queue is empty, rather than waiting for the `'drain'` event to be emitted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork(this._inFlightWrites);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cork` method is called with the number of in-flight writes, which would cause the stream to be
