  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host == null || baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical AND operator (`&&`), which requires both conditions to be true, while the new code fragment uses the logical OR operator (`||`), which only requires one condition to be true. This means that if `parsedUrl.host` is `null`, the new code fragment will always evaluate to `true`, regardless of the value of `baseUrlStr`. In contrast, the original code fragment would only evaluate to `true` if `baseUrlStr` is not `null`.
