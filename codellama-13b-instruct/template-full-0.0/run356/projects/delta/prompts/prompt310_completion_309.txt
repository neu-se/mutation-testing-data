  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ }
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty object literal would be treated as a block statement, causing the code to be executed asynchronously.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ }
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty object literal would be treated as a block statement, causing the code to be executed asynchronously.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ }
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty object literal would be treated as a block statement, causing the code to be executed asynchronously.

DONE.
