  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign is flipped, which would cause the denominator of the complex number's real and imaginary parts to have the opposite sign of the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the sin function would be used instead of the cos function, which would cause a difference in the values of the complex number's real and imaginary parts.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1-Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the numerator would be decreased by one, which would cause a difference in the values of the complex number's real and imaginary parts.

DONE.
