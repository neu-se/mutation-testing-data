  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(result.value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with the value of `result.value`, instead of resolving it with that value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(result.value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with the value of `result.value`, instead of rejecting it with that value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(result.value).then(function (value) {
    return value;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with the value of `result.value`, and then return that value in a new promise.

DONE.
