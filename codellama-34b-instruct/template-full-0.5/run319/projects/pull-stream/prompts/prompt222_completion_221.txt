  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, data
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`, and would cause the callback to be called with a different set of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not the same as `data`, and would cause the callback to be called with a different set of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, data
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the callback to be called with the same argument twice, which is not the same as the original code fragment.

DONE.
