  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `request` variable would be assigned to the `http` module instead of the `https` module, which could cause the request to be sent over an unencrypted connection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `request` variable would be assigned to the `http` module and the URL would be modified to include the `http://` protocol, which could cause the request to be sent over an unencrypted connection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `request` variable would be assigned to the `https` module and the URL would be modified to include the `https://` protocol, which could cause the request to be sent over an encrypted connection.

DONE.
