  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this._queue.has(key)) {
  this._writeStream.write(JSON.stringify(this._data.get(key)) + '\n', 'utf-8');
  this._queue.delete(key);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the key exists in the data store, but this modified code checks if the key exists in the queue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this._data.size === 0) {
  this._queue.clear();
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the data store is empty, but this modified code clears the queue regardless of whether the data store is empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.pipe(this._writeStream);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pulls data from the read stream and writes it to the write stream, but this
