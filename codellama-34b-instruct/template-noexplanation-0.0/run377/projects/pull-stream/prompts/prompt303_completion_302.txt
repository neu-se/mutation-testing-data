  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended
```
This change will cause the `read` function to be called with `true` instead of `ended`, which may cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && !end
```
This change will cause the `read` function to be called with `ended` instead of `end`, which may cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || !ended
```
This change will cause the `read` function to be called with `end` instead of `ended`, which may cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
