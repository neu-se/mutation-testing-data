 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'persons'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns 'person' for the input 'person', while this change would return 'persons'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { return 'peoples'; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return 'peoples' regardless of the input, whereas the original code returns 'person' for the input 'person'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w.charAt(w.length - 1) === 'n' ? w : w + 'n'; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an 'n' to the end of the input if it doesn't already end with 'n', whereas the original code has specific rules for adding 's', 'es', or 'ies' to the end of the input.

DONE.
