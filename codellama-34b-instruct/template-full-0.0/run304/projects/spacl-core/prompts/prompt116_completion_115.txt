  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb of verbs.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because `verbs.keys()` returns an iterator over the keys of the `verbs` object, whereas `verbs` returns an iterator over the values of the `verbs` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb of verbs.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because `verbs.values()` returns an iterator over the values of the `verbs` object, whereas `verbs` returns an iterator over the keys of the `verbs` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb of Object.keys(verbs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys(verbs)` returns an array of the keys of the `verbs` object, whereas `verbs` returns an iterator over the values of the `verbs` object.

DONE.
