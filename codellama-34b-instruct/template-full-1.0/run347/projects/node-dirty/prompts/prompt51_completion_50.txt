  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data` is a `Map` object, and `this.get` is a function that retrieves the value for a given key from the database. By using `this._data.get(key)`, we are instead retrieving the value directly from the in-memory cache, which may not be the same as the value stored in the database.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.has(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data.has(key)` checks whether the cache has an entry for the given key, whereas `this.get(key)` retrieves the value for the key from the database.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data.delete(key)` removes the entry for the given key from the cache, whereas `this
