  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would bind the `hasOwnProperty` method to `null`, causing it to always return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.bind(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would bind the `hasOwnProperty` method to `undefined`, causing it to always return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.bind("")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would bind the `hasOwnProperty` method to an empty string, causing it to always return `false`.

DONE.
