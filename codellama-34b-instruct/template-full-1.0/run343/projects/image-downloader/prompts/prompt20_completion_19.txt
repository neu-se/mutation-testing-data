  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!path.isAbsolute
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.isAbsolute` checks if a path is an absolute path, while `!path.isAbsolute` checks if a path is not an absolute path. The code will still work for absolute paths, but it may not work correctly for relative paths.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isRelative
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.isRelative` checks if a path is a relative path, while `!path.isAbsolute` checks if a path is not an absolute path. The code will still work for relative paths, but it may not work correctly for absolute paths.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename(options.dest) !== options.dest
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.basename` gets the basename of a path, while the original code fragment checks if the `options.dest` path is absolute.
