Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the length of the next operation instead of its type, which could lead to incorrect handling of operations that are not inserts.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the type of the other iterator instead of the current iterator, potentially causing the logic to incorrectly prioritize operations from the other delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it hardcodes the type check to always look for a 'delete' operation, ignoring the actual type of the current operation and leading to incorrect processing of inserts and retains.

DONE.
