  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.retain` is a different operation than `op.delete`, and it would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` instead of `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!op.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `!op.delete` is the opposite of `op.delete`, and it would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` instead of `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain && op.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.retain && op.delete` is a different condition than `op.delete`, and it would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` instead of `false`.

DONE.
