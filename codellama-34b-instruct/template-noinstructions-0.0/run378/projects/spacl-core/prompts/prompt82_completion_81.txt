  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `matches` method would return `true` for any path, regardless of whether it is governed by the policy or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `matches` method would return `false` for any path, regardless of whether it is governed by the policy or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `matches` method would return `true` for any path that is an empty string, regardless of whether it is governed by the policy or not.

DONE.
