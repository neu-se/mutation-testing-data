Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0] + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends an 's' to the rule's match string, which would cause the comparison to always fail for any word that does not end with 's', leading to incorrect pluralization.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].test(word) && rule[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it evaluates to `rule[0]` only if the test passes, which means that if the regex does not match, it will not check the actual string value, potentially skipping valid rules.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it compares the length of the word to the rule, which is not a valid comparison and will always return false, causing the function to skip all rules and default to appending 's' to the word.

DONE.
