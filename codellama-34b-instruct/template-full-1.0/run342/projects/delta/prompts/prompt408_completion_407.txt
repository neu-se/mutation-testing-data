  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.chop.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` is a method of the `Function` prototype, and calling it on `delta.chop` would result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.chop.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is also a method of the `Function` prototype, and calling it on `delta.chop` would result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.chop.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` is also a method of the `Function` prototype, and calling it on `delta.chop` would result in an error.

DONE.
