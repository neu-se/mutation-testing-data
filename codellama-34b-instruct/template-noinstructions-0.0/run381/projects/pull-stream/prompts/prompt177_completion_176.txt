  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `abort` is truthy, while this replacement checks if `abort` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `abort` is truthy, while this replacement checks if `abort` is truthy and `false` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `abort` is truthy, while this replacement checks if `abort` is truthy or `true` is truthy.

DONE.
