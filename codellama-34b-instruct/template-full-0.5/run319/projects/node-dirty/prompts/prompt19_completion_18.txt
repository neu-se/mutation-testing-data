  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, []
```
This would result in different behavior because the `[]` is an empty array, and would not contain any callbacks to invoke.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an array, and would not have a `push` method to add callbacks.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not an array, and would not have a `push` method to add callbacks.

DONE.
