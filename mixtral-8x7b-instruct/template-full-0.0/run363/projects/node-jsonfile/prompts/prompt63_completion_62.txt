 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => content.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps the `toString` method in an arrow function, changing the context in which it is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.valueOf().toString
