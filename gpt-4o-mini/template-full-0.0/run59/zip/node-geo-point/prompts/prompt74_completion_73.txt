Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI / 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly converts degrees to radians by using a constant instead of the `deg2rad` function, which may lead to incorrect calculations in the destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(bearing + 90)
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 90 degrees to the bearing before converting it to radians, which would skew the calculated destination point by 90 degrees.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(bearing * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the bearing by 2 before converting it to radians, effectively doubling the angle and leading to an incorrect destination point.

DONE.
