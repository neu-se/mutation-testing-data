 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ReturnValue` exception would not receive a value, potentially causing issues in the generator function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'unexpected string'
