  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, options, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only passes two arguments to `universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFile)`, but the modified code fragment passes three arguments. This could cause the `universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFile)` function to behave differently, potentially causing the test to fail.

DONE.
