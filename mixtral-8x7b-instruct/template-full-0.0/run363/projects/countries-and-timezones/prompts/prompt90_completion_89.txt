 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'UTC'
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the placeholder with a specific timezone name, causing the `getCountryForTimezone` function to always return the same country object for that timezone.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data.timezones[0].name
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the placeholder with the name of the first timezone in the data, causing the `getCountryForTimezone` function to always return the country object associated with the first timezone.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
options.tzName || 'UTC'
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the provided `tzName` if it exists, but defaults to 'UTC' if it doesn't, causing the `getCountryForTimezone` function to return the country object associated with the 'UTC' timezone when no `tzName` is provided.
