  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(null).then
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `value` variable, while this modified code would create a promise that is immediately resolved with a value of `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(void 0).then
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `value` variable, while this modified code would create a promise that is immediately resolved with a value of `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject().then
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `value` variable, while this modified code would create a promise that is immediately rejected with a value of a new rejected promise.

DONE.
