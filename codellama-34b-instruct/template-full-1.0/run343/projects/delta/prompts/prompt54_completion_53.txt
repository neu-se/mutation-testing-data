  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray(ops)
```
This would result in different behavior because `!Array.isArray(ops)` will only return `true` if `ops` is not an array, whereas the original code `Array.isArray(ops)` returns `true` if `ops` is an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops instanceof Array
```
This would result in different behavior because `instanceof` operator checks if an object is created by a constructor, while `Array.isArray()` method checks if an object is an array. These two are not the same and may return different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(ops) === '[object Array]'
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString.call(ops)` returns a string that represents the type of `ops`. Using this method will give the same result as `Array.isArray(ops)`, but is more
