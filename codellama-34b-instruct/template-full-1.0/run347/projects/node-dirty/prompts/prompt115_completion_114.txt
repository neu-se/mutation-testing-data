  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.key
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key` property is not
defined on the `_data` object, and would result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.key = ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key` property is not
defined on the `_data` object, and would result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.size = 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the `size` property is defined
on the `_data` object, and would modify the size of the data structure.

DONE.
