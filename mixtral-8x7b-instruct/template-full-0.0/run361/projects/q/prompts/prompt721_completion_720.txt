 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve(promises);` line in the original code would not be called, and the returned promise would never be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_reduce` function would not iterate over any elements, and the returned promise would be resolved immediately with an empty array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
42
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_reduce` function would not iterate over any elements, and the returned promise would be resolved immediately with the value `42`.

DONE.
