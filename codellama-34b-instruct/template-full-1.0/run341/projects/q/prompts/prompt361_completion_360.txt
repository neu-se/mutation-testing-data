  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the deferred object with the `value` as the fulfillment value, while the original code would resolve it with the value returned by `_fulfilled(value)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the deferred object with the `exception` as the rejection reason, while the original code would reject it with the value returned by `_rejected(exception)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(newValue);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would notify the deferred object with the `newValue` as the notification value, while the original code would notify it with the value returned by `_progressed(value)`.

DONE.
