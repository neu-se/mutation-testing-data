  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, i++
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`, and it would cause the function to return `undefined` instead of `null` when `i` is greater than `max`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i, i++
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `i` instead of `null` when `i` is greater than `max`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1, i++
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `i + 1` instead of `null` when `i` is greater than `max`.

DONE.
