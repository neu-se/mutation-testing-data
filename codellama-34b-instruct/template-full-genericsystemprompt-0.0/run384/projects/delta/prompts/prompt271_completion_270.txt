  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasNext() && iter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the next operation if it is not an insert, which would cause the loop to terminate early in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasNext() && iter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the next operation if it is an insert, which would cause the loop to terminate early in some cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasNext() && iter.peekType() !== 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the next operation if it is not a delete, which would cause the loop to terminate early in some cases.

DONE.
