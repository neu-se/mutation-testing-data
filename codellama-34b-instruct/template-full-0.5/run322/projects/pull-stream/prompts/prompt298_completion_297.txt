  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `ended` variable as an argument to the `cb` function, while this alternative code fragment passes `null` instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `ended` variable as an argument to the `cb` function, while this alternative code fragment passes `true` instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `ended` variable as an argument to the `cb` function, while this alternative code fragment passes `false` instead.

DONE.
