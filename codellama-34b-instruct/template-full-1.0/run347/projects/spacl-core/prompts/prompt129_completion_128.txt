  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would decrement the `index` variable instead of incrementing it, which would cause the loop to terminate prematurely and potentially skip over some iterations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip over every other iteration, which could affect the correctness of the program's output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would reset the `index` variable to 0 every time it iterates, which would cause the loop to run indefinitely.

DONE.
