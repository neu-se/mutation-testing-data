 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty object does not have the same properties as `newOp`, and will likely cause the code to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` does not have any properties, and will likely cause the code to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` returns a random number, which is not an object with the same properties as `newOp`. This will likely cause the code to fail or behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
