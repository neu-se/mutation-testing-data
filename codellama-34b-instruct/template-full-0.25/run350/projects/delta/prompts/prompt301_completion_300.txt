  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at index 1 instead of 0, potentially skipping the first element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at index -1 instead of 0, potentially causing an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at index 0 and increment by 2 each iteration, potentially skipping every other element in the array.

DONE.
