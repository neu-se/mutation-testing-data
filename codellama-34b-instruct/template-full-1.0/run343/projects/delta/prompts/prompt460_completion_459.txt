  Misunderstood the nature of the problem you were faced with. Here is an example of a replacement that should cause unexpected behavior

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length - this.index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `ops.length - index -` will often exceed the length of the array resulting in an incorrect remove value.

Please let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with.
