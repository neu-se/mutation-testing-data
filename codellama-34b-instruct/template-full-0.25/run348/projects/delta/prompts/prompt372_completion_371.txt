  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `Op.length` returns the length of an operation, while `Op.length + 1` would return the length plus one, which would cause the code to behave differently when handling operations with lengths greater than one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `Op.length` returns the length of an operation, while `Op.length - 1` would return the length minus one, which would cause the code to behave differently when handling operations with lengths greater than one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `Op.length` returns the length of an operation, while `Op.length * 2` would return the length multiplied by two, which would cause the code to behave differently when handling operations with lengths greater than one.

DONE.
