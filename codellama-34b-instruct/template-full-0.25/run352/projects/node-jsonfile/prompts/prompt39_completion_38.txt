  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFileSync` is a synchronous function that returns `undefined`, whereas `fs.writeFile` is an asynchronous function that returns a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFile.bind(fs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFile.bind(fs)` is a bound function that returns a new function with a different `this` value, whereas `fs.writeFile` is a function that returns a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFile.call(fs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFile.call(fs)` is a function call that returns a promise, whereas `fs.writeFile` is a function that returns a promise.

DONE.
