  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` and `deferred.reject` are different methods that are used to resolve or reject a promise, respectively.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject` is a static method that creates a new promise that is rejected with the given value, while `deferred.reject` is a method that rejects the promise with the given value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a static method that creates a new promise that is rejected with the given value, while `deferred.reject` is a method that rejects the promise with the given value.

DONE.
