  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `parts.reduce` is a method that reduces an array to a single value, while `parts.reverse` is a method that reverses the order of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `parts.reduce` is a method that reduces an array to a single value, while `parts.concat` is a method that concatenates two or more arrays.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `parts.reduce` is a method that reduces an array to a single value, while `parts.slice` is a method that extracts a subset of an array.

DONE.
