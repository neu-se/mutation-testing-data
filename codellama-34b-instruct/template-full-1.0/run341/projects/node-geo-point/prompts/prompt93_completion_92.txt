  Sure! Here are three options for the PLACEHOLDER:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-θ
```
This would result in different behavior because the minus sign would negate the value of theta, resulting in a different calculation for sinθ and cosθ.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2*θ
```
This would result in different behavior because doubling the value of theta would result in a different calculation for sinθ and cosθ.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI/2 + θ
```
This would result in different behavior because adding Math.PI/2 to theta would result in a different calculation for sinθ and cosθ.

DONE.
