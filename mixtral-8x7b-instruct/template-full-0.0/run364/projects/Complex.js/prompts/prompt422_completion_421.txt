 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the number is close to zero, while this change checks for exact equality with zero. This could cause issues if the number is very close to zero but not exactly zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re'] < 0.00001
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the number is close to zero, while this change checks if the number is less than a very small constant. This could cause issues if the number is close to but greater than the constant.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.isZero(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the number is close to zero, while this change checks if the number is equal to one. This would cause the function to always return `Complex['INFINITY']`, regardless of the input
