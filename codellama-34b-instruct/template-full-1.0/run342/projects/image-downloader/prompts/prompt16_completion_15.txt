  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest = path.join(options.url, decodedBasename);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the URL as the base directory for the destination path, which is different from the original code that used the current directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest = path.join(options.dest, decodedBasename);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the destination path as the base directory for the destination path, which is different from the original code that used the current directory.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest = path.join(path.basename(options.url), decodedBasename);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the basename of the URL as the base directory for the destination path, which is different from the original code that used the current directory.

DONE.
