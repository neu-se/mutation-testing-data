  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty(object, key) && key !== "prototype"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `prototype` property is not included in the original code fragment, which would cause the `array_keys` function to return an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty(object, key) && key !== "length"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property is not included in the original code fragment, which would cause the `array_map` function to return an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty(object, key) && key !== "constructor"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `constructor` property is not included in the original code fragment, which would cause the `object_create` function to return an incorrect result.

DONE.
