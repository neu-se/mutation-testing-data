  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect` is a method that returns a string representation of the object, but `value.inspect` is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.inspect.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect.call` is a method that returns a string representation of the object, but `value.inspect.call` is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.inspect.apply()
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect.apply` is a method that returns a string representation of the object, but `value.inspect.apply` is undefined.

DONE.
