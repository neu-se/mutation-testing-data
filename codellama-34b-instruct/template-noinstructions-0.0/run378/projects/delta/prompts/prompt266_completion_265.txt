  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `opLength` is used to determine the length of the operation, while `0` would always result in a length of 0, potentially causing the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `opLength` is used to determine the length of the operation, while `-1` would always result in a length of -1, potentially causing the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `opLength` is used to determine the length of the operation, while `null` would always result in a length of 0, potentially causing the code to behave differently.

DONE.
