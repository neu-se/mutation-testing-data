  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.delete` is a different value than `otherOp.retain`, which could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` when it should evaluate to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.retain - 1` is a different value than `otherOp.retain`, which could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` when it should evaluate to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.retain + 1` is a different value than `otherOp.retain`, which could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` when it should evaluate to `true`.

DONE.
