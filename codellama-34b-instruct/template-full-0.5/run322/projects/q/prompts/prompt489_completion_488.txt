  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resetUnhandledRejections` function expects an array as its argument, but `0` is a number. This would cause an error when the function tries to access the `length` property of the argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections([]);
```

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections([1]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resetUnhandledRejections` function expects an array with a single element that is a promise, but `[1]` is an array with a
