  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['phi']
```
This would result in different behavior because `a['phi']` is a different property than `a['r']`, and it is not clear what the intended behavior of the code is when `a['phi']` is used instead of `a['r']`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['abs']
```
This would result in different behavior because `a['abs']` is a different property than `a['r']`, and it is not clear what the intended behavior of the code is when `a['abs']` is used instead of `a['r']`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg']
```
This would result in different behavior because `a['arg']` is a different property than `a['r']`, and it is not clear what the intended behavior of the code is when `a['arg']` is used instead of `a['r']`.

DONE.
