Your task is to apply mutation testing to the following code:
```
'use strict'

module.exports = function count (max) {
  var i = 0; max = max || Infinity
  return function (end, cb) {
    if(end) return cb && cb(end)
    if(i > max)
      return cb(<PLACEHOLDER>)
    cb(null, i++)
  }
}



```

by replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different
behavior than the original code fragment, which was:
```
true
```
Please consider changes such as using different operators, changing constants,
referring to different variables, object properties, functions, or methods.  

Provide three answers as fenced code blocks containing a single line of code,
using the following template:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```

Please conclude your response with "DONE."
