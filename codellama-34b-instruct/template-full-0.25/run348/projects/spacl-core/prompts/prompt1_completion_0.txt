  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is not the same as the original.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is not the same as the original.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/) === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is not the same as the original.

DONE.
