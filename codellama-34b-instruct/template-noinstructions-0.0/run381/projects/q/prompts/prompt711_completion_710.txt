  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"values"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys` method is used to retrieve the keys of an object, while the `values` method is used to retrieve the values of an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"entries"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys` method is used to retrieve the keys of an object, while the `entries` method is used to retrieve the key-value pairs of an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hasOwnProperty"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys` method is used to retrieve the keys of an object, while the `hasOwnProperty` method is used to check if an object has a property with the given name.

DONE.
