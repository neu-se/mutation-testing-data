  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a, b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.atan2` function, which takes two arguments and returns the arctangent of the quotient of those arguments. In this option, the arguments are swapped, which would result in a different angle being calculated and a different complex number being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b, a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.atan2` function, which takes two arguments and returns the arctangent of the quotient of those arguments. In this option, the second argument is incremented by 1, which would result in a different angle being calculated and a different complex number being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b, b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.atan2` function, which takes two arguments and returns the arct
