  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(dstOffset)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getOffsetStr` function with the `dstOffset` argument, which is not the same as the `offset` argument that the function expects. This could cause the function to return an incorrect offset string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(utcOffset)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getOffsetStr` function with the `utcOffset` argument, which is not the same as the `offset` argument that the function expects. This could cause the function to return an incorrect offset string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(dstOffset + utcOffset)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getOffsetStr` function with the sum of the `dstOffset` and `utcOffset` arguments, which is not the same as the `offset` argument that the function expects
