  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a reference to a function, while the new code fragment is a function call, which would cause the function to be executed immediately, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
