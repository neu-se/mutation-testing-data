  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 1)` would return a different array than `array_slice(arguments, 2)`, which is the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)` would return a different array than `array_slice(arguments, 2)`, which is the original code fragment.

DONE.
