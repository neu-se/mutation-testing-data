  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops[other.ops.length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the last element of `other.ops` instead of the first, which could lead to different test cases being generated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops[Math.floor(other.ops.length / 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the middle element of `other.ops` instead of the first, which could lead to different test cases being generated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops[Math.random() * other.ops.length]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate a random element of `other.ops` instead of the first, which could lead to different test cases being generated.

DONE.
