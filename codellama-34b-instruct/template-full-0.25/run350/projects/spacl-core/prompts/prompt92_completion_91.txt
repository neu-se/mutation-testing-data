  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const policy of policies.reverse())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, so the loop would iterate over the policies in reverse order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const policy of policies.filter(p => p.name !== 'admin'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter()` method filters the array to only include policies with a name that is not 'admin', so the loop would skip over any policies with the name 'admin'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const policy of policies.slice(1))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method returns a new array with the first element removed, so the loop would start from the second element in the array.

DONE.
