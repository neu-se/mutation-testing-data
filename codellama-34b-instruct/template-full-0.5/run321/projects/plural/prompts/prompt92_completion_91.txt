  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chillis'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a typo, and the correct plural form of "chilli" is "chillies."

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chillieses'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a typo, and the correct plural form of "chilli" is "chillies."

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chillies' + 'es'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a typo, and the correct plural form of "chilli" is "chillies."

DONE.
