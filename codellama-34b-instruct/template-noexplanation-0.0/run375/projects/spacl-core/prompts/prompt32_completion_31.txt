  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => seg + acc, ''
```
This change will cause the finalise function to return a regex that matches the empty string, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => seg + acc, '^'
```
This change will cause the finalise function to return a regex that matches the start of the string, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => seg + acc, '$'
```
This change will cause the finalise function to return a regex that matches the end of the string, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
