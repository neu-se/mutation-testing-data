  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b == 0
```
This is a simple typo, where the comparison operator `==` was used instead of `===`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This is the opposite of the original code, where the comparison operator `!==` was used instead of `===`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > 0
```
This is a different comparison, where the comparison operator `>` was used instead of `===`.

DONE.
