  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
last !== test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `!==` is a strict equality operator, while `!` is a not operator. This means that the `last` value would not be negated, and the `test` function would not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
! = (test(data))
```
This would result in different behavior because `!` is a not operator, but it is being used as an assignment operator. This would assign the value of `test(data)` to `!`, which would not have the intended effect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `test` is a function call, and it is not clear what the intended behavior is. It is possible that the function is being called with an unexpected value, or that the function is being called at an unexpected time.

DONE.
