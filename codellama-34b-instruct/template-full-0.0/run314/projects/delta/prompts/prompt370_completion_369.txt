  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a method that deletes the specified number of characters from the delta, whereas `retain` is a method that retains the specified number of characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(length, {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the specified number of characters with an empty attribute map, whereas the original code fragment retains the specified number of characters with the current attribute map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(length, { bold: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the specified number of characters with the bold attribute set to true, whereas the original code fragment retains the specified number of characters with the current attribute map.

DONE.
