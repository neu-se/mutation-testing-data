  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
updater();

This would result in different behavior because the updater function would be called without any arguments, which would result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
updater('some_key');

This would result in different behavior because the updater function would be called with a hardcoded key 'some_key' instead of the original key passed as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
updater(this.get('some_other_key'));

This would result in different behavior because the updater function would be called with a different key 'some_other_key' instead of the original key passed as an argument.

DONE.
