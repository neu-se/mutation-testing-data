  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'write_close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `write_close` event is not emitted when the read stream is closed, whereas the `read_close` event is emitted when the read stream is closed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` event is not emitted when the read stream is closed, whereas the `read_close` event is emitted when the read stream is closed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` event is not emitted when the read stream is closed, whereas the `read_close` event is emitted when the read stream is closed.

DONE.
