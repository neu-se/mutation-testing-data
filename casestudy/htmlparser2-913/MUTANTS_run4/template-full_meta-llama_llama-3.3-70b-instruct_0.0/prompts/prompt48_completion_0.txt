Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.updatePosition(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `updatePosition` method is called with an offset of 0 instead of the original offset of 1 or the calculated offset, potentially leading to incorrect indexing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.tokenizer.updatePosition(2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `updatePosition` method is called on the `tokenizer` object instead of the current object, potentially affecting the tokenizer's state instead of the parser's state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.endIndex = this.tokenizer.getAbsoluteIndex() + 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `endIndex` is updated directly without calling the `updatePosition` method, potentially bypassing other necessary updates or checks performed by the `updatePosition` method.

DONE.
