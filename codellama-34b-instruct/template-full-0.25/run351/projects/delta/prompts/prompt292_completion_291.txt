  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the index is greater than 0, which means it will only execute the code inside the if statement if the index is greater than 0. However, if we replace it with `index < 0`, the code inside the if statement will only execute if the index is less than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the index is greater than 0, which means it will only execute the code inside the if statement if the index is greater than 0. However, if we replace it with `index === 0`, the code inside the if statement will only execute if the index is equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the index is greater than 0, which means it
