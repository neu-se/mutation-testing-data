  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.hasNext() && otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical OR operator `||`, which checks if either operand is truthy. In contrast, the replacement code fragment uses the logical AND operator `&&`, which checks if both operands are truthy. This means that the replacement code fragment will only evaluate to true if both `thisIter.hasNext()` and `otherIter.hasNext()` are true, whereas the original code fragment would evaluate to true if either operand is true.

DONE.
