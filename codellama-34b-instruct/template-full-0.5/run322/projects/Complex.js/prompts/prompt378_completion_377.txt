  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` is a different variable than `a`, and the resulting complex number would be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `a + 1` is a different expression than `a`, and the resulting complex number would be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `a * 2` is a different expression than `a`, and the resulting complex number would be different.

DONE.
