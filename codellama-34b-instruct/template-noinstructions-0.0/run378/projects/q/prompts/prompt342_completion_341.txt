  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(_fulfilled(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_fulfilled` function is not called, and the promise is resolved with the original value instead of the transformed value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(_rejected(exception));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_rejected` function is not called, and the promise is resolved with the original exception instead of the transformed exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(_fulfilled(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_fulfilled` function is not called, and the promise is rejected with the original value instead of the transformed value.

DONE.
