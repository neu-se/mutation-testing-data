  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete", [value]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `value` argument is different from the `key` argument that was originally used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key, value]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method is different from the `delete` method that was originally used.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method is different from the `delete` method that was originally used.

DONE.
