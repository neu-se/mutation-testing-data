  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be accessing the next element in the array instead of the current element, which could cause the code to fail if the array is not large enough.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be accessing the previous element in the array instead of the current element, which could cause the code to fail if the array is not large enough.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be adding 1 to the value of the current element in the array, which could cause the code to fail if the array contains non-numeric values.

DONE.
