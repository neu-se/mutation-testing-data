  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` is a method that returns a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, whereas `map` is a method that returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.every
```
This would result in different behavior because `every` is a method that returns true if every element in the array passes the test implemented by the provided function, whereas `map` is a method that returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.some
```
This would result in different behavior because `some` is a method that returns true if any element in the array passes the test implemented by the provided function, whereas `map` is a method that returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in
