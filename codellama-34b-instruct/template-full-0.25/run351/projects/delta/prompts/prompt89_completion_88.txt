  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp.attributes` could be an object, but `null` is a primitive value and would not have the same properties or methods as an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp.attributes` could be an object, but `undefined` is a primitive value and would not have the same properties or methods as an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes !== {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp.attributes` could be an object, but `{}` is an empty object and would not have the same properties or methods as an object.

DONE.
