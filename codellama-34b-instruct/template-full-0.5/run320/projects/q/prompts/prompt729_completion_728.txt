  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, which could affect the behavior of the `all` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method returns a shallow copy of a portion of the array, which could affect the behavior of the `all` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.concat(Q.resolve(42))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method returns a new array that is the result of concatenating the original array with the new values, which could affect the behavior of the `all` method.

DONE.
