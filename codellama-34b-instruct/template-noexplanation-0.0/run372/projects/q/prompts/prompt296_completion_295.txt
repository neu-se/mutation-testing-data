  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(y).join
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses `y` instead of `x`. This change may cause the `join` method to be called on a different object, which could result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(x).then
```
This code fragment is different from the original, as it uses the `then` method instead of `join`. This change may cause the promise to be resolved or rejected differently, depending on the implementation of the `then` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(x).catch
```
This code fragment is different from the original, as it uses the `catch` method instead of `join`. This change may cause the promise to be rejected differently, depending on the implementation of the `catch` method.

DONE.
