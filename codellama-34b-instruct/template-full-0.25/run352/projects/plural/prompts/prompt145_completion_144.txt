  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` is an operator that returns a string indicating the type of a variable, while `type` is a function that returns the type of a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).slice(8, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the type of the object as a string, but it would not take into account the specific rules defined in the `addRule` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the plural form of a word by adding 'ies' to the end, but it would not take into account the specific rules defined in the `addRule` function.

DONE.
