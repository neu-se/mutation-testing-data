  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys` method would return a promise for an array of numbers instead of a promise for an array of property names.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys` method would return a promise for `undefined` instead of a promise for an array of property names.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (result) { return Object.keys(result); });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys` method would return a promise for an array of property names, but the promise would not be resolved until the original promise returned by the method is resolved.

DONE.
