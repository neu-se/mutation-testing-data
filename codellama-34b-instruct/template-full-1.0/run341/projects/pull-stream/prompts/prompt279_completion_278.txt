  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop` is a function that returns an object, but `prop[0]` would return the first property of the object, which may not be the same as the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop` is a function that returns an object, but `prop()` would call the function and return the return value, which may not be the same as the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop` is a function that returns an object, but `prop.length` would return the length of the function, which may not be the same as the original behavior.

DONE.
