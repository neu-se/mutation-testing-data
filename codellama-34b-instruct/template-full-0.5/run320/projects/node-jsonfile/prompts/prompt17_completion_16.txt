  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator is not used, and the code would be comparing the value of `options` to the string `'string'`, rather than checking if `options` is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.toString() === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method is called on `options`, which would convert the value of `options` to a string, and then the code would be comparing the stringified value of `options` to the string `'string'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.constructor === String
```
This would result in different behavior because the `constructor` property of `options` is being compared to the `String` constructor, rather than checking if `options` is a string.

DONE.
