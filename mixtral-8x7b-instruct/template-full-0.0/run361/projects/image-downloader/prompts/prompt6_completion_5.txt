 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'An error occurred'
```
This would result in different behavior because it doesn't provide a clear error message about the missing `options.dest`. It would make it harder to debug and understand the issue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `null` instead of rejecting the promise with an error would not signal an error to the caller, and could lead to unexpected behavior or errors down the line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Error()
