  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    x['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be using the imaginary part of the complex number instead of the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    logHypot(<PLACEHOLDER>, x['re']) / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be using the hypot function with only the real part of the complex number instead of both real and imaginary parts.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    new Complex(<PLACEHOLDER>, x['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be creating a new complex number with the real part set to the PLACEHOLDER value and the imaginary part set to the imaginary part of the original complex number.

DONE.
