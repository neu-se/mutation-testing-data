  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
inverted.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `inverted.delete` would delete the retain operation, whereas `inverted.retain` would retain it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
inverted.retain(Op.length(op))
```
This would result in different behavior because `inverted.retain(Op.length(op))` would retain the entire length of the op, whereas `inverted.retain` would only retain the attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
inverted.retain(Op.length(op), oper.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because `inverted.retain(Op.length(op), oper.attributes)` would retain the length of the op and also retain the attributes of the op, whereas `inverted.retain` would only retain the attributes.

DONE.
