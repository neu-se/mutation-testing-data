  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `dispatch` method to be called with an incorrect argument, potentially leading to an error or unexpected result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `dispatch` method to be called with a promise, potentially leading to an error or unexpected result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `dispatch` method to be called with a rejected promise, potentially leading to an error or unexpected result.

DONE.
