  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `Op.length` is expected to be a positive integer, and the comparison with a negative number would always evaluate to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length <= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `Op.length` is expected to be a positive integer, and the comparison with `0` or a negative number would always evaluate to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `Op.length` is expected to be a positive integer, and the comparison with `0` would always evaluate to `false`.

DONE.
