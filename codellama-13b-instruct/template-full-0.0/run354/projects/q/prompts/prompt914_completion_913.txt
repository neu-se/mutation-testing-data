  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array would be missing the last element, which is the callback function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array would contain a `null` value, which would cause the `setTimeout` function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array would contain an empty object, which would cause the `setTimeout` function to throw an error.

DONE.
