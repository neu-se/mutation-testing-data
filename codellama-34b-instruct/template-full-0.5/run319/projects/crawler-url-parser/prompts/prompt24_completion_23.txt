  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#./
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/#./` matches any character after the `#` symbol, while the original regular expression `/#.*$/` matches any character after the `#` symbol until the end of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#[^#]*$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/#[^#]*$/` matches any character after the `#` symbol until the end of the string, while the original regular expression `/#.*$/` matches any character after the `#` symbol until the end of the string, but only if the `#` symbol is not followed by another `#` symbol.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#[^\/]*$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/#[^\/]*$/` matches any character after the `#` symbol until the end of the string, while the original regular expression `/#.*$/` matches any character
