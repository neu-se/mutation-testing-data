```
typeof exports !== "object" && typeof module !== "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because if the `typeof exports` and `typeof module` are not objects, it would return true, even if the module is unused.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === "object" && typeof module !== "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because if the `typeof exports` is an object and `typeof module` is not an object, it would return true, even if the module is used in a non-object context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports !== "object" && typeof module === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because if the `typeof exports` is not an object and `typeof module` is an object, it would return true, even if the module is used in an object context.

DONE.
