  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace any occurrence of `/` in the `pageurl_path` string with the given replacement string, whereas the original code would only split the string around `/` characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path. concat
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `pageurl_path` string with the given argument, whereas the original code would split the string around `/` characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path. split
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the `pageurl_path` string around the words "nice" and "day" instead of around `/` characters, which would change the meaning of the code.

DONE.
