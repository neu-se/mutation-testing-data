  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength()` returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, while `peekType()` returns the type of the next operation. If the next operation is a retain, `peekType()` would return "retain", while `peekLength()` would return the number of characters to retain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekOp()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekOp()` returns the next operation in the iterator, while `peekType()` returns the type of the next operation. If the next operation is a retain, `peekType()` would return "retain", while `peekOp()` would return the retain operation itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `next()` returns the next operation in the iterator and advances the iterator, while `pe
