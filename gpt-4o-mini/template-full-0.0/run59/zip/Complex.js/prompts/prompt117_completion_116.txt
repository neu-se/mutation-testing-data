Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the imaginary part to zero regardless of the second argument, which may lead to incorrect complex number representation when the second argument is intended to be used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, b
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the real part to zero, which would incorrectly represent the complex number when the first argument is intended to be used as the real part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b, a
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the real and imaginary parts, leading to an incorrect representation of the complex number as the roles of the inputs are reversed.

DONE.
