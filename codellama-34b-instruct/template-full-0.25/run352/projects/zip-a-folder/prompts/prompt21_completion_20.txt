  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append the string "foo" to the target file path, which would change the output file name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first character of the target file path, which would change the output file name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the target file path to uppercase, which would change the output file name.

DONE.
