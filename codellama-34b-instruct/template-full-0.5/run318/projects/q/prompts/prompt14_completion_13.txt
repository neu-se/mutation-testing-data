  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.notOk
```
This would result in different behavior because `ses.notOk` is a negation of `ses.ok`, meaning that it would return `true` if the current value is not okay, and `false` if it is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.isNotOk
```
This would result in different behavior because `ses.isNotOk` is a negation of `ses.isOk`, meaning that it would return `true` if the current value is not okay, and `false` if it is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.isOkay
```
This would result in different behavior because `ses.isOkay` is a negation of `ses.isOk`, meaning that it would return `true` if the current value is not okay, and `false` if it is.

DONE.
