```
addRule('goose', 'geese')
```
This would result in different behavior because the rule for 'goose' would be added twice, which would cause the pluralization of 'goose' to return 'geesees' instead of 'geese'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('goose', 'gooses')
```
This would result in different behavior because the rule for 'goose' would be added with a different result, which would cause the pluralization of 'goose' to return 'gooses' instead of 'geese'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('goose', function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'i' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the rule for 'goose' would be added with a different function, which would cause the pluralization of 'goose' to return 'goosi' instead of
