  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the base delta starting at the specified index, rather than a slice of the base delta starting at the specified index and ending at the end of the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex, baseIndex + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the base delta starting at the specified index and ending at the end of the delta, rather than a slice of the base delta starting at the specified index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the base delta starting at the specified index plus 1, rather than a slice of the base delta starting at the specified index.

DONE.
