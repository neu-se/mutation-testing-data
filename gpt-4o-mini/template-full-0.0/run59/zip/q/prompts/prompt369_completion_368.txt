Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("An error occurred")
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of passing the original exception, a new error object is created and passed, which changes the context of the error handling and may lead to loss of the original error information.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` instead of the original exception means that the rejection handler will not receive any error information, potentially leading to unhandled promise rejections or misleading error handling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Some string"
```
This would result in different behavior because passing a string instead of the original exception will cause the rejection handler to receive a string value, which is not an instance of an Error, thus altering how the error is processed and potentially leading to incorrect error handling logic.

DONE.
