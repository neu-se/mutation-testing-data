  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(aborted)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb(aborted)` would only call the `cb` function with the `aborted` argument, while the new code fragment `abortCb(aborted)` would also call the `abortCb` function with the `aborted` argument, which could have unintended consequences if `abortCb` is not intended to be called in this context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb(aborted)` would call the `cb` function with the `aborted` argument, while the new code fragment `null` would not call the `cb` function at all.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb(aborted)` would call the `cb` function with the `aborted`
