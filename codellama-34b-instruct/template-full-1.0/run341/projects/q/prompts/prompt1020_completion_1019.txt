  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"send"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to use the "send" message instead of the "post" message, which could have unintended consequences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to use the "foo" message instead of the "post" message, which could have unintended consequences.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1000
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to use the numeric value 1000 instead of the "post" message, which could have unintended consequences.

DONE.
