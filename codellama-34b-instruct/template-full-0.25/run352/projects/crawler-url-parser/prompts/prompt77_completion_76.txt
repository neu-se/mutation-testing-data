  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedBaseUrlStr.replace(/^https?:\/\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `URL.parse()` method to parse the URL, which includes the protocol (e.g. `http://` or `https://`), while the modified code fragment uses the `String.replace()` method to remove the protocol from the URL. This could cause the `parse()` method to return a different result, which could in turn affect the behavior of the `extract()` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedBaseUrlStr.replace(/^https?:\/\//, 'http://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `URL.parse()` method to parse the URL, which includes the protocol (e.g. `http://` or `https://`), while the modified code fragment uses the `String.replace()` method to replace the protocol with `http://`. This could cause the `parse()` method to return a different result, which could in
