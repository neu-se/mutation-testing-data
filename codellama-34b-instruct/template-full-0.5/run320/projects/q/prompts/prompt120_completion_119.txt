  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, whereas the original code would return `true` if `this` is not `null` or `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, regardless of whether `this` is `null` or `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, regardless of whether `this` is `null` or `undefined`.

DONE.
