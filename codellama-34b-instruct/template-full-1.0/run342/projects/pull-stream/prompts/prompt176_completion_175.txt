  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.slice()` creates a shallow copy of the array, while `array` returns the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.length` returns the length of the array, while `array` returns the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.concat(array)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.concat(array)` creates a new array by concatenating the original array with itself, while `array` returns the original array.

DONE.
