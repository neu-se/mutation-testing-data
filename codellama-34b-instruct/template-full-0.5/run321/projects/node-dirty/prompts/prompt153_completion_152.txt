  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork();
```
This would result in different behavior because `uncork` is not a function, so it would throw a `TypeError` when called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork();
```
This would result in different behavior because `cork` is not a function, so it would throw a `TypeError` when called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.close();
```
This would result in different behavior because `close` is a function that closes the write stream, which would cause the code to exit the loop early and not write the remaining data to the file.

DONE.
