Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, 'default')
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a hardcoded string 'default' instead of the variable `name`, which means it will always return the timezone associated with 'default' rather than the intended timezone based on the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name.toUpperCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because it transforms the `name` variable to uppercase before passing it to `buildTimezone`, which may not match the expected timezone names in the `data` object, leading to incorrect or missing timezone data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name + 'Extra')
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends the string 'Extra' to the `name` variable, which alters the input and likely results in a lookup for a non-existent timezone, causing the function to return null or an unexpected result.

DONE.
