 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue instanceof Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `nearerValue` is an instance of the `Promise` constructor, while the modified code uses the `instanceof` operator, which checks if `nearerValue` is an instance of the `Promise` constructor or its prototype.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(nearerValue) === nearerValue
