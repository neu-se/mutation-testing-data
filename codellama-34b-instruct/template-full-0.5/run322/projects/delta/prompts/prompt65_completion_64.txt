  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` property of `newOp` would be set to `null`, which would cause the `insert` method to fail if it is called with a non-null argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` property of `newOp` would be set to `undefined`, which would cause the `insert` method to fail if it is called with a non-undefined argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = NaN;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` property of `newOp` would be set to `NaN`, which would cause the `insert` method to fail if it is called with a non-NaN argument.

DONE.
