  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, onUnhandledError
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `void 0`, and it would cause the `onUnhandledError` function to be called with `null` as the first argument, rather than `void 0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, onUnhandledError
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value than `void 0`, and it would cause the `onUnhandledError` function to be called with `undefined` as the first argument, rather than `void 0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `onUnhandledError` function to be called with `null` as the second argument, rather than `void 0`.

DONE.
