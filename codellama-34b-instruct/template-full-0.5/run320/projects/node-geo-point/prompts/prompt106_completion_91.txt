  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.pow` raises a number to a power, while `Math.sqrt` returns the square root of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.pow` returns a decimal value, while `Math.round` rounds a number to the nearest integer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.pow` returns a decimal value, while `Math.floor` rounds a number down to the nearest integer.

DONE.
