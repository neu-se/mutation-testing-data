  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.invert(opData, baseOpData)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` method is called with two arguments, whereas the original code only passed one argument. This could potentially cause the `invert` method to behave differently and result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.invert(opData, baseOpData, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` method is called with three arguments, whereas the original code only passed two arguments. This could potentially cause the `invert` method to behave differently and result in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.invert(opData, baseOpData, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` method is called with three arguments, whereas the original code only passed two arguments. This could potentially cause the `invert` method to behave differently and result in different behavior.
