  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which means that the `then` method would be called on the promise returned by `Q.nfapply(FS.readFile, [__filename])`. Replacing `1` with `0` would cause the `fail` method to be called instead, which would result in a different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which means that the `then` method would be called on the promise returned by `Q.nfapply(FS.readFile, [__filename])`. Replacing `1` with `2` would cause the `done` method to be called instead, which would result in a different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which means that the `then` method
