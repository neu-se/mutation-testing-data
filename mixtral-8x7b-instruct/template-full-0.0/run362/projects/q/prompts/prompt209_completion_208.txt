 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback.bind(null, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls the callback with the arguments provided to the defer function, while this modification would call the callback with a single argument 1, regardless of the arguments provided to the defer function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback || function(){}
