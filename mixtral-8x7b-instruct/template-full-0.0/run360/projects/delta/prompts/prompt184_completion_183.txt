 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisOp.retain !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison checks for nullability instead of checking if `retain` is a number. This could lead to unexpected behavior when dealing with operations that have a retain value of `null` but are not numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
typeof thisOp.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `retain` is a string, which is not the original intention. This could lead to unexpected behavior when dealing with operations that have a retain value of a different type, such as a number or an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
typeof thisOp.retain === 'symbol'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `retain` is a symbol, which is not the original intention. This could lead to unexpected behavior when dealing with operations that have a retain value of a
