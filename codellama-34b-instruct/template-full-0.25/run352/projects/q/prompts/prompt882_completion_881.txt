  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method that is called when the promise is resolved, whereas `fail` is a method that is called when the promise is rejected. Using `then` instead of `fail` would cause the promise to be resolved even if the original code fragment would have rejected it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `catch` is a method that is called when the promise is rejected, whereas `fail` is a method that is called when the promise is rejected. Using `catch` instead of `fail` would cause the promise to be rejected even if the original code fragment would have resolved it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).finally
```
This would result in different behavior because `finally` is a method that is called when the promise is resolved or rejected
