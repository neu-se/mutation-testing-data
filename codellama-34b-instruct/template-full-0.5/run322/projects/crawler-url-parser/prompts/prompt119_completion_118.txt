  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseUrl.protocol` would return the protocol of the base URL, whereas `baseUrl` would return the entire URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.hostname
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseUrl.hostname` would return the hostname of the base URL, whereas `baseUrl` would return the entire URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseUrl.pathname` would return the pathname of the base URL, whereas `baseUrl` would return the entire URL.

DONE.
