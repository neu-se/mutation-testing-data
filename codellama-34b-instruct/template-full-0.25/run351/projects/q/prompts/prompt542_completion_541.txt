  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.slice()` creates a shallow copy of the `array` object, while `array` itself is a reference to the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.concat()` creates a new array by concatenating the elements of the `array` object with the elements of the `args` array, while `array` itself is a reference to the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.map(function(x) { return x; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.map()` creates a new array by applying the provided function to each element of the `array` object, while `array` itself is a reference to the original array.

DONE.
