  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).slice(8, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `slice` method to extract a substring from the result of `Object.prototype.toString.call(obj)`, while this new code fragment uses the `slice` method to extract a substring from the result of `Object.prototype.toString.call(obj)` and then negates the result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).slice(8, -1) + 'ies'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `slice` method to extract a substring from the result of `Object.prototype.toString.call(obj)`, while this new code fragment uses the `slice` method to extract a substring from the result of `Object.prototype.toString.call(obj)` and then appends the string `'ies'` to the result.
