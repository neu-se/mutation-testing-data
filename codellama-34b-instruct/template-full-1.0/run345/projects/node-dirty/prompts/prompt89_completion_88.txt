  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.length == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `!rowStr` is checking if the `rowStr` variable is falsy, while this replacement checks if the length of the `rowStr` variable is equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `!rowStr` is checking if the `rowStr` variable is falsy, while this replacement checks if the `rowStr` variable is an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.trim() === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `!rowStr` is checking if the `rowStr` variable is falsy, while this replacement checks if the `rowStr` variable is an empty string or contains only whitespace.

DONE.
