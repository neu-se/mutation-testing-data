  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
any
```
This would result in different behavior because `any` is a function that returns the first fulfilled promise, whereas `allResolved` returns a promise for an array of promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allSettled
```
This would result in different behavior because `allSettled` returns a promise for an array of states for the respective values, whereas `allResolved` returns a promise for an array of promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would reject the promise returned by `allResolved`, whereas `allResolved` returns a promise that is never rejected.

DONE.
