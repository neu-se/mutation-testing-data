  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat()` always returns a new array, while `arguments` is a special object that is passed to functions and has a special behavior when used with `apply()` and `call()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[].slice.call(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array that is not an exact copy of `args`, but rather a new array with the same elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[].concat(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array that is not an exact copy of `args`, but rather a new array with the same elements.

DONE.
