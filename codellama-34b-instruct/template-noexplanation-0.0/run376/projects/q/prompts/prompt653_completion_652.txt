  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses `array_slice(arguments, 1)` instead of `array_slice(arguments, 2)`. This will cause the `args` array to start at the second argument instead of the third, which may cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
