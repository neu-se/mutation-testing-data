  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the typeof operator always returns a string, so the check would never evaluate to true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl == undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the typeof operator always returns a string, so the check would never evaluate to true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.length == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to throw an error if pageurl is not a string.

DONE.
