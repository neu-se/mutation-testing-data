 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback(value, index, self)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method is removed, changing the `this` context of the `callback` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback.apply(null, [value, index, self])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is used instead of `call`, changing how arguments are passed to the `callback` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback.call(self, index, value, self)
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of arguments passed to the `callback` function is changed.

DONE.
