  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream = values(stream)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `values` function to be called on the `stream` object, which would return an array of values from the stream, rather than the original code which simply assigns the `stream` object to the `_read` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream = once(stream)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `once` function to be called on the `stream` object, which would return a new stream that only emits the first value from the original stream, rather than the original code which simply assigns the `stream` object to the `_read` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream = null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `stream` variable to be set to `null`, rather than the original code which assigns the `stream` object to the `_read` variable.

DONE
