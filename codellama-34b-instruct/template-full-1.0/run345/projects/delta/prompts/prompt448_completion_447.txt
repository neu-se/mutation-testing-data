  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!op
```
This would result in different behavior because `!op` is the negation of `op`, so it would invert the boolean value of `op`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `op + 1` would increment the value of `op` by 1, which could change the value of the `retain` property in the `Op` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `op - 1` would decrement the value of `op` by 1, which could change the value of the `retain` property in the `Op` object.

DONE.
