  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < max
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `i` is greater than `max`, while this replacement checks if `i` is less than `max`. This change would cause the function to return a different value in some cases, which could potentially break the code that relies on this function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i >= max
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `i` is greater than `max`, while this replacement checks if `i` is greater than or equal to `max`. This change would cause the function to return a different value in some cases, which could potentially break the code that relies on this function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i !== max
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `i` is greater than `max`, while this replacement checks if `i` is not equal to `max`. This change would cause the
