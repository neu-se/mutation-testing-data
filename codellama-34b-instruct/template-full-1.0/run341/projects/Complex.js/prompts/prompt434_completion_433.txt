  Hope this helps!

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` rounds towards negative infinity, while `Math.pow` rounds towards zero. For example, if the input is 1.5, `Math.floor(1.5)` would result in 1, while `Math.pow(1.5, 0)` would result in 2. Additionally, `Math.floor` only accepts an integer number as the second argument, while `Math.pow` can take any number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.round` and `Math.pow` have different rounding behavior. For example, if the input is 1.75, `Math.round(1.75)` would result in 2, while `Math.pow(1.75, 0)` would result in 175. Additionally, `Math.round` only accepts an integer number as the second
