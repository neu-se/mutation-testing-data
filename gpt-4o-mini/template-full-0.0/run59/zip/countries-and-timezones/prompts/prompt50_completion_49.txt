Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(data.timezones).forEach(() => {});
```
This would result in different behavior because it effectively does nothing in the loop, meaning that `timezones` will not be populated or updated, potentially leading to incorrect results when `deliverTimezones` is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(data.timezones).forEach((key) => delete timezones[key]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it clears the `timezones` object, which would cause `getAllTimezones` to return an empty object or incorrect data, as all previously memoized timezones would be removed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(data.timezones).forEach((key) => memoizedTimezones++);
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly increments `memoizedTimezones` for each timezone without actually memoizing them, leading to a mismatch between the actual number of timezones and the memoized count, which could cause unexpected results in subsequent calls.

DONE.
