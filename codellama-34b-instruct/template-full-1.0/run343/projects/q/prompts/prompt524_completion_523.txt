  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the `object` parameter to `undefined`, which could cause errors if the function is not designed to handle such a case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(new Error("Test error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a rejected promise, which could cause the `Q.master` function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the `object` parameter to `null`, which could cause errors if the function is not designed to handle such a case.

DONE.
