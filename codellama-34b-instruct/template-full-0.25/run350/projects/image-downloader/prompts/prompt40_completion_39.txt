  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ filename: 'wrong_dest' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filename` property is set to a different value than the original code fragment, which could cause the file to be written to the wrong location.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ filename: dest + '.txt' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filename` property is set to a different value than the original code fragment, which could cause the file to be written with a different extension.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ filename: dest, mode: 'w' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `mode` property is set to a different value than the original code fragment, which could cause the file to be written in a different mode (e.g. append instead of overwrite).

DONE.
