  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a comma operator, which evaluates both expressions and returns the second one. The new code fragment, on the other hand, is an addition operator, which returns the sum of the two expressions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a comma operator, which evaluates both expressions and returns the second one. The new code fragment, on the other hand, is a subtraction operator, which returns the difference of the two expressions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a comma operator, which evaluates both expressions and returns the second one. The new code fragment, on the other hand, is a multiplication operator, which returns the product of the two expressions.

DONE.
