 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let i = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it declares `i` using `let` instead of `var`, making it block-scoped instead of function-scoped. This could potentially affect the behavior of the `for` loop if the loop body has nested blocks.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets `i` to 1 instead of 0, causing the loop to skip the first iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const i = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it declares `i` as a constant, which would cause a syntax error on the next line where `i` is incremented (`i++`).

DONE.
