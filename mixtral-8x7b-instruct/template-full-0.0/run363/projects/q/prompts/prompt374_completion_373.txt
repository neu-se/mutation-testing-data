 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new error object, while the original code fragment uses the `e` variable which presumably contains an error object already. This change would affect the error handling in the `_rejected` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the error object with `null`. This change would cause the `rejected` function to not receive an error object, potentially causing issues in error handling and reporting.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.reject('An error occurred')
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new rejected promise instead of passing the error object to the `rejected` function. This change would affect the error handling in the `then` method, potentially causing issues in error propagation and handling.

DONE.
