  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `field` variable is being modified by adding 1 to it, which could potentially change the output of the `unique` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `field` variable is being multiplied by 2, which could potentially change the output of the `unique` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `field` variable is being replaced with its length, which could potentially change the output of the `unique` function.

DONE.
