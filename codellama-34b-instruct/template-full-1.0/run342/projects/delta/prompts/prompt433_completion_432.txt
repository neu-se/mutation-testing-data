  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `Op.length` is a method that returns the length of an operator, but replacing it with `0` would cause the method to always return `0`, which would cause the code to always return `false` for `hasNext`, `true` for `next`, and an empty array for `rest`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 -1
```
This would result in different behavior because `Op.length` is a method that returns the length of an operator, but replacing it with `-1` would cause the method to always return `-1`, which would cause the code to always return `true` for `hasNext`, and an empty array for `rest`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 console.log(Op.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Op.length` is a method that returns the length of an operator, but replacing it with `console.log(Op.length
