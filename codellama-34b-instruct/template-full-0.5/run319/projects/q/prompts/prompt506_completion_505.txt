  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `args` is an array, and the new code fragment `[]` is an empty array. This change would cause the `post` method to always return `undefined` instead of a value from the `args` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `args` is an array, and the new code fragment `null` is not an array. This change would cause the `post` method to always return `null` instead of a value from the `args` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `args` is an array, and the new code fragment `undefined` is not an array. This change would cause the `post` method to always return `undefined` instead of a value from the `args` array.

DONE.
