  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method returns a shallow copy of the specified portion of the array, whereas the `substr` method returns a substring of the specified length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substring
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring` method returns a substring of the specified length, whereas the `substr` method returns a substring of the specified length, but also allows for negative values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.slice(0, w.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method returns a shallow copy of the specified portion of the array, whereas the `substr` method returns a substring of the specified length.

DONE.
