  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is always truthy, so the `op` function would never be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!end` operator would always be falsey, so the `op` function would always be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end === true` condition would only be true if the `end` variable is strictly equal to the boolean value `true`, which is unlikely to be the case in most scenarios.

DONE.
