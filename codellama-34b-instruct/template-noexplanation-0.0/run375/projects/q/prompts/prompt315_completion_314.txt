  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fallback === null
```
This change will cause the `fallback` function to be called when the `descriptor` object does not have a method with the same name as the operation being performed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fallback === undefined
```
This change will cause the `fallback` function to be called when the `descriptor` object does not have a method with the same name as the operation being performed, and the `fallback` function is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof fallback !== "function"
```
This change will cause the `fallback` function to be called when the `descriptor` object does not have a method with the same name as the operation being performed, and the `fallback` function is not a function.

DONE.
