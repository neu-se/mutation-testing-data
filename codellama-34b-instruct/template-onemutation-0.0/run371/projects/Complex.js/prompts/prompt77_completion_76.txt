  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment increments the value of `i` by 1, while the mutated code fragment decrements the value of `i` by 1. This change in behavior could potentially cause the program to produce incorrect results or behave in an unexpected manner. DONE.
