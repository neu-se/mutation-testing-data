  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.archive
```
This would result in different behavior because `archive` is not a method of `archiver.Archiver`, and will cause a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.glob.(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because `glob` is not a method of `archiver.Archiver`, and will cause a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.file(src, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because `file` is not a method of `archiver.Archiver`, and will cause a `TypeError`.

DONE.
