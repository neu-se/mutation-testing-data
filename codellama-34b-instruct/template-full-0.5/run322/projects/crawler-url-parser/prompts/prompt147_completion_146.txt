  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.split("/", 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only split the path into two parts, whereas the original code splits it into multiple parts.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.split("")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the path into individual characters, whereas the original code splits it into parts separated by "/".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/\//g, " ")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace all "/" characters with spaces, whereas the original code splits the path into parts separated by "/".

DONE.
