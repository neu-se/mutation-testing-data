  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the bearing from the longitude instead of the latitude.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-this.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the bearing in the opposite direction.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the bearing with an offset.

DONE.
