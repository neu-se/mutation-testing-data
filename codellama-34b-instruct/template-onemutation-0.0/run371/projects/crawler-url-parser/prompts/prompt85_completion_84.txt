  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().split(" ").join("");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `trim()` to remove whitespace from the beginning and end of the text, while the new code fragment uses `split()` and `join()` to remove all whitespace from the text. This could cause the `text` variable to have a different value than the original code, which could in turn affect the behavior of the `gettype()` function.

DONE.
