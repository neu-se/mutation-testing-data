  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, cb || function () {}
```
This code fragment is the same as the original code fragment, and it has the same behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, cb && function () {}
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code fragment, but it uses the `&&` operator instead of the `||` operator. This can cause the function to behave differently in certain cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, cb ? function () {} : null
```
This code fragment is different from the original code fragment, and it uses the ternary operator to conditionally return a function or `null`. This can cause the function to behave differently in certain cases.

DONE.
