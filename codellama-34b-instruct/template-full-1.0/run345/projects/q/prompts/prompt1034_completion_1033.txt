  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
captureLine + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `captureLine` function would be called with the wrong line number, potentially resulting in errors or unexpected behavior in the code that uses the `qEndingLine` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `qEndingLine` variable would be set to `null`, potentially causing errors or unexpected behavior in the code that uses the variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"qEndingLine"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `qEndingLine` variable would be set to the string `"qEndingLine"`, rather than the actual line number, potentially causing errors or unexpected behavior in the code that uses the variable.

DONE.
