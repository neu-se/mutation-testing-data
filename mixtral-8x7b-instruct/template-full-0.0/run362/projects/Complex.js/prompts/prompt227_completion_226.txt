 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because the square root of a negative number would be a real number instead of a complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / a
```
This would result in different behavior because the result would be inverted when `a` is negative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of `a` would be ignored, always resulting in a positive square root.

DONE.
