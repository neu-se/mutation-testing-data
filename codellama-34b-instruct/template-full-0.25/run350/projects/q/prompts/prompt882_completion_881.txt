  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `fail` to handle rejections, while this new code fragment uses `reject` directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `fail` to handle rejections, while this new code fragment uses `notify` to handle rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `fail` to handle rejections, while this new code fragment uses `resolve` to handle rejections.

DONE.
