  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read && read.source
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if `read` is truthy and has a `source` property, even if `read.source` is not a function. In the original code, we check that `read.source` is a function before assigning it to `read`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read && typeof read.source !== 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if `read` is truthy and `read.source` is not a function. In the original code, we check that `read.source` is a function before assigning it to `read`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read && typeof read.source === 'function' && read.source.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `true` if `read` is truthy, `read.source` is a
