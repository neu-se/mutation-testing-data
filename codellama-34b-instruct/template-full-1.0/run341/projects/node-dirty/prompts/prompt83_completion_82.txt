  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `lastIndexOf` method returns the index of the last occurrence of the specified value in the given string, but `chunk.lastIndexOf(str, -1)` would return the index of the second occurrence instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `lastIndexOf` method returns the index of the last occurrence of the specified value in the given string, but `chunk.lastIndexOf(str, 1)` would return the index of the first occurrence instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `lastIndexOf` method returns the index of the last occurrence of the specified value in the given string, but `chunk.lastIndexOf(str, 0)` would return the index of the last occurrence of the specified value in the given string, and not the index of the second occurrence.
