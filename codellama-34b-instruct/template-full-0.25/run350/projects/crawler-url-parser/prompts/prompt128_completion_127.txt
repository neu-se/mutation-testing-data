  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl === "string"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for both value and type equality, whereas the `==` operator only checks for value equality. In this case, the `pageurl` variable is a string, but the `===` operator would return `false` because the type of `pageurl` is not a string literal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of a string returns the number of characters in the string, whereas the `length` property of a string literal returns the number of characters in the string literal. In this case, the `pageurl` variable is a string, but the `length` property of the string literal would return 0, whereas the `length` property of the string would return a non-zero value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.indexOf("string") === -1
