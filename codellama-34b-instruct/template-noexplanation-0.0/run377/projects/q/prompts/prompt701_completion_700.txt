  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This change will cause the `fbound` function to ignore the first argument when calling the `dispatch` method, which may cause the function to behave differently than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This change will cause the `fbound` function to ignore the first two arguments when calling the `dispatch` method, which may cause the function to behave differently than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 3)
```
This change will cause the `fbound` function to ignore the first three arguments when calling the `dispatch` method, which may cause the function to behave differently than intended.

DONE.
