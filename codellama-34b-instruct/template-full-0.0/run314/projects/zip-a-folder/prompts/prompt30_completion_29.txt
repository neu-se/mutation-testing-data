  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment listens for the 'close' event, which is emitted when the output stream is closed, while the new code fragment listens for the 'error' event, which is emitted when there is an error writing to the output stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finish', resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment listens for the 'close' event, which is emitted when the output stream is closed, while the new code fragment listens for the 'finish' event, which is emitted when the output stream has finished writing all data to the underlying system.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end', resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment listens for the 'close' event, which is emitted when the output stream is closed, while the new code fragment listens for the 'end' event,
