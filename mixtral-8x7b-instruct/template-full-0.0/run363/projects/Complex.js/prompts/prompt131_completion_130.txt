 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to divide 1 by the result of the `isInfinite()` method, which would either result in `NaN` or throw an error if the method returns `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, even if the original expression would have returned `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the complex number is `NaN`, which is not the same as checking if it is infinite.

DONE.
