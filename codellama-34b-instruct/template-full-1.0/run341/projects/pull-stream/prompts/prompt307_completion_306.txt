  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with a `null` error argument, whereas the original code called it with a formatted error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with an `undefined` error argument, whereas the original code called it with a formatted error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log('Error!')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would log the error message to the console, whereas the original code passed it to the `cb` function as an argument.

DONE.
