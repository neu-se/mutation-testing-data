 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
for (const key in b) {
  if (b.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
    attributes[key] = b[key];
  }
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `for...in` loop with `hasOwnProperty` check, which can lead to skipping inherited properties from the prototype chain, unlike the original `Object.keys` which returns an array of all enumerable properties found directly upon an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.getOwnPropertyNames(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.getOwnPropertyNames` returns an array of all own property names found directly upon an object, but it does not include properties inherited from the prototype chain, unlike `Object.keys` which includes all enumerable properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.values(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values`
