  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.valueOf() instanceof StopIteration
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `isStopIteration` function, which is not defined in the provided code snippet.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isStopIteration(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because it reverses the condition to check if the exception is not an instance of `StopIteration`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always result in the `if` block being executed, regardless of the value of `isStopIteration(exception)`.

DONE.
