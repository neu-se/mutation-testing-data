Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(thisIter.next());
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes the next operation from `thisIter` instead of the current operation from `otherOp`, potentially altering the composition of the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherOp.retain);
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to push a number (the retain value) instead of an operation object, which would likely lead to an error or an invalid state in the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push({ delete: otherOp.delete });
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new operation with only the delete property from `otherOp`, ignoring other important properties and potentially leading to incorrect delta composition.

DONE.
