  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
      target.push(objects.slice(0, index));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the objects from the start of the array, rather than from the end, which is the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
      target.push(objects.slice(index + 1));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the objects from the start of the array, rather than from the end, which is the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

DONE.
