  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` is now `2`, which would return a different subset of the `arguments` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument to `array_slice` is now `1`, which would return only the first element of the `arguments` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument to `array_slice` is now `2`, which would return only the first two elements of the `arguments` array.

DONE.
