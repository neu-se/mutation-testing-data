Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the callback function with a `false` argument instead of the expected behavior of calling it with no arguments, which may lead to different handling of the callback in the consuming code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort(new Error('Stream aborted'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it invokes the `abort` function with an error object, which indicates that the stream has been aborted, rather than simply calling the callback, potentially causing the consuming code to handle the error instead of completing normally.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, 'done')
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the callback with two arguments, `null` and the string `'done'`, which may lead to the consuming code interpreting this as a successful completion with a result, rather than an empty stream.

DONE.
