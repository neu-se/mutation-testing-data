  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"put"
```
This would result in different behavior because `put` is not a valid method for a `Promise` object. The original method `post` is used to send a message to a target object in a future turn, but `put` is not a recognized method and would result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete"
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is not a valid method for a `Promise` object. The original method `post` is used to send a message to a target object in a future turn, but `delete` is a reserved word in JavaScript and would result in a syntax error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply"
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` is a method for calling a function with a given `this` value and an array of arguments. The original method `post` is used to send a message to a target object in a future turn,
