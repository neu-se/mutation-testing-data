  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.readdir
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.promises.readdir` returns the contents of a directory, while `fs.promises.access` checks if a file exists and is accessible.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.lstat
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.promises.lstat` returns metadata about a file, while `fs.promises.access` checks if a file exists and is accessible.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.readFile
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.promises.readFile` reads the contents of a file, while `fs.promises.access` checks if a file exists and is accessible.

DONE.
