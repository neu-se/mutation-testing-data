Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it only uses the longitude value from the coordinates array instead of both longitude and latitude, which would lead to incorrect GeoPoint creation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it reverses the order of the coordinates, causing the latitude and longitude to be swapped, which would result in an incorrect GeoPoint.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[point.coordinates[0] + 1, point.coordinates[1] + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to both the longitude and latitude values, effectively shifting the GeoPoint's location by one degree in both directions, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
