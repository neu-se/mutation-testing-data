  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` returns a rejected promise, whereas `Q` returns a resolved promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve(1)` returns a resolved promise with the value `1`, whereas `Q` returns a resolved promise with the value `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all([])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all([])` returns a resolved promise with an empty array, whereas `Q` returns a resolved promise with the value `undefined`.

DONE.
