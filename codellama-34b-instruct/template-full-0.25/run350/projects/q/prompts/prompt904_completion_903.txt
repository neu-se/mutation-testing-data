  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is not a function of the `this` object, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).catch(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch` method is not a function of the `this` object, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).then(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is not a function of the `this` object, and would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
