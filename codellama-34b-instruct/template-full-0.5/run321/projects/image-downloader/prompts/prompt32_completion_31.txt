  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode === 404
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for a status code of 200, which indicates a successful response. However, the new code fragment checks for a status code of 404, which indicates a resource not found error. This would cause the promise to reject with a different error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode !== 200 && res.statusCode !== 201
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for a status code of 200, which indicates a successful response. However, the new code fragment checks for a status code of 200 or 201, which indicates a successful response with a created resource. This would cause the promise to resolve with a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode === 500
```
This would result in different behavior because
