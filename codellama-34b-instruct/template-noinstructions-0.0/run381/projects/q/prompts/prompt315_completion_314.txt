  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fallback === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `fallback` would be considered `null` instead of `undefined`, which could cause the `Promise` constructor to throw an error if `fallback` is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fallback === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `fallback` would be considered `undefined` instead of `null`, which could cause the `Promise` constructor to throw an error if `fallback` is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fallback === void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `fallback` would be considered `void 0` instead of `undefined`, which could cause the `Promise` constructor to throw an error if `fallback` is not a function.

DONE.
