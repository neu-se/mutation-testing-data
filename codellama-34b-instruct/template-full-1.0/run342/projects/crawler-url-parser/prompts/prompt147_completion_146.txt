  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (elem, index, array) {
  return elem.length !== 0;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment filters out empty elements, whereas the new code fragment does not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (elem, index, array) {
  return index % 2 === 0;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment filters out elements at odd indices, whereas the new code fragment filters out elements at even indices.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (elem, index, array) {
  return array.length - index;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment filters out elements based on their indices relative to the end of the array, whereas the new code fragment filters out elements based on their indices relative to the start of the array.

DONE.
