  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was `domain.exit()`, which would call the `exit()` method on the `domain` object, while `1 + 1` is a mathematical expression that evaluates to 2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello world"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was `domain.exit()`, which would call the `exit()` method on the `domain` object, while `"hello world"` is a string literal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was `domain.exit()`, which would call the `exit()` method on the `domain` object, while `undefined` is a value that represents an uninitialized variable or non-existent property.

DONE.
