  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.defer()` function returns a promise that is resolved with the value `null`, whereas the original code fragment returns a promise that is resolved with the value `undefined`. This could cause issues in the code that relies on the return value of the `put()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.defer()` function returns a promise that is resolved with the value `1`, whereas the original code fragment returns a promise that is resolved with the value `undefined`. This could cause issues in the code that relies on the return value of the `put()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer(Q.reject(new Error("Test error")))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.defer()` function returns a promise that is rejected
