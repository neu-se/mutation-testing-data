  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.toString(<PLACEHOLDER>) === "[object process]"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process.toString()` method returns a string representation of the `process` object, which is not necessarily equal to the string `"[object process]"`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.toString(<PLACEHOLDER>) === "[object process]"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process.toString()` method returns a string representation of the `process` object, which is not necessarily equal to the string `"[object process]"`.

DONE.
