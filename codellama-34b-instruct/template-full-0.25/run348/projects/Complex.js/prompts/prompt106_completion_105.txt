  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not have any arguments, while this new code fragment has an argument of 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not have any arguments, while this new code fragment has an argument of 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(-1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not have any arguments, while this new code fragment has an argument of -1.

DONE.
