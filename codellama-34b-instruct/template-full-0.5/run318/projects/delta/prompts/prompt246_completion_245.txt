  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` method inserts a new element into the delta, whereas the `delete` method removes an element from the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` method retains the current element in the delta, whereas the `delete` method removes an element from the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method adds a new element to the end of the delta, whereas the `delete` method removes an element from the delta.

DONE.
