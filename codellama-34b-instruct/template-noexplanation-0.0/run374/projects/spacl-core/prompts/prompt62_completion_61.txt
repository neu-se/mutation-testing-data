  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.reverse()
```
This code fragment is a function call that reverses the order of the elements in the `props` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.slice().reverse()
```
This code fragment is a function call that creates a shallow copy of the `props` array, reverses the order of the elements in the copy, and returns the reversed array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.sort()
```
This code fragment is a function call that sorts the elements in the `props` array in ascending order.

DONE.
