  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var a = 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is not defined in the original code, and its assignment would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("Hello, world!");
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would log a message to the console, which is not the intended behavior of the `captureLine` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return 42;
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would return a value, which is not the intended behavior of the `captureLine` function.

DONE.
