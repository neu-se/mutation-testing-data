  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(name).name
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the name of the timezone instead of the timezone object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(name).offset
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the offset of the timezone instead of the timezone object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(name).deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the deprecated status of the timezone instead of the timezone object.

DONE.
