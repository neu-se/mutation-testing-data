  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `array_slice` with the `arguments` object as its context, which would result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.apply(null, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `array_slice` with a null context, which would result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `array_slice` with the `arguments` object as its first argument, which would result in an error.

DONE.
