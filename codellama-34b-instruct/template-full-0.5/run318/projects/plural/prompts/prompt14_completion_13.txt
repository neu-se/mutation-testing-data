  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method takes the starting index as its first argument, and a negative value would cause it to start from the end of the string. In this case, `w.substr(-1, w.length - 1)` would return an empty string, causing the plural form of the word to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method takes the starting index as its first argument, and a value of `w.length - 2` would cause it to start from the second-to-last character of the string. In this case, `w.substr(w.length - 2, w.length - 1)` would return the last two characters of the word, causing the plural form of the word to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 3
```
