  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isInternalFrame` function to always return `false`, regardless of whether the stack trace is from the Q library or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isInternalFrame` function to always return `true`, regardless of whether the stack trace is from the Q library or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isInternalFrame` function to always return `false`, regardless of whether the stack trace is from the Q library or not.

DONE.
