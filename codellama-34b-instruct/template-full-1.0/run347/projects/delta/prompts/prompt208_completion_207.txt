  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.chop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `chop()` method removes zero-width characters at the end of the delta, while the `concat()` method returns a new delta that is the concatenation of `this` and `other`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method returns a new delta that includes only the first character, while the `concat()` method returns a new delta that includes all characters up to the end of either `this` or `other`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.slice(-1, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method returns a new delta that includes only the last character, while the `concat()` method returns a new delta that includes all characters up to the end of either `this` or `other`.

DONE.
