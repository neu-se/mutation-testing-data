  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb](args)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` parameter is not being passed to the `generator[verb]` function, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb](arg)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arg` parameter is being passed to the `generator[verb]` function instead of the `args` parameter, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb](arg, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arg` and `args` parameters are being passed to the `generator[verb]` function, which could cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
