Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for strict equality to `null`, which would not account for the case where `fileNameAndLineNumber` is `undefined`, potentially allowing the function to proceed when it should not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the existence of `fileNameAndLineNumber` being not `undefined`, which would allow the function to continue even if `fileNameAndLineNumber` is `null`, leading to incorrect behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `fileNameAndLineNumber` is an empty array or string, which would not correctly handle the case where `fileNameAndLineNumber` is `null` or `undefined`, potentially causing the function to behave incorrectly.

DONE.
