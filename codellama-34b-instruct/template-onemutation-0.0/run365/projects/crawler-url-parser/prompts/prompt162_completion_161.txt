  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if the difference in the number of path parts is exactly 1, while the new code fragment checks if the difference is greater than 1. This means that the new code fragment would consider a link as "sublevel" if it has more than one path part more than the current page, while the original code fragment would only consider it as "sublevel" if it has exactly one path part more.
