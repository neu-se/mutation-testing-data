 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would override the `dispatch` method with `undefined`, causing any further calls to `dispatch` to do nothing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch = function() {};
```
This would result in different behavior because it would override the `dispatch` method with an empty function, causing any further calls to `dispatch` to have no effect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch = this.reject;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would override the `dispatch` method with the `reject` method, causing any further calls to `dispatch` to reject the promise with the given reason.

DONE.
