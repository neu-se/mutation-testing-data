 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).then(null, deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the fail callback to a `then` call with only the error handler, which might not propagate the error correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject("post", [name, nodeArgs]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly calls the `reject` method with an array of arguments instead of using the `fail` method to handle the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.dispatch("get", [name, nodeArgs]).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the method called on the `dispatch` object from "post" to "get", which would likely cause the function to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
