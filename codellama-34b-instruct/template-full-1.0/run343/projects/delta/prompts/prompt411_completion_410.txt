  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!thisIter.hasNext
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `while` loop to continue even if there are no more ops to iterate over, leading to an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `while` loop to go to the next op even if there are no more ops to iterate over, leading to an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `while` loop to retrieve the next op even if there are no more ops to iterate over, leading to an error.

DONE.
