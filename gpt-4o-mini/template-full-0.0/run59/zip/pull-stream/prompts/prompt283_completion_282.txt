Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes the error to the callback with a `null` data value, which may not be the intended behavior when an error occurs, as the original code simply calls `cb` with the original `end` and `data`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly indicates that there is no error (by passing `null` as the first argument) while still providing the `data`, which contradicts the logic that an error occurred.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it sends `undefined` as the data instead of the expected `data`, which could lead to confusion or errors in the handling of the callback response.

DONE.
