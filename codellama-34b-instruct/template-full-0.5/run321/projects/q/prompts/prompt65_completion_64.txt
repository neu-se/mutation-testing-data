  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush()
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush` is not a function and would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('test')
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw new Error('test')` would throw an error with the message "test", while `flush` would continue to run the code in the `while` loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log('test')
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.log('test')` would log the message "test" to the console, while `flush` would continue to run the code in the `while` loop.

DONE.
