  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `toString()` to convert the buffer to a string, while this replacement uses `toLowerCase()` which would change the content of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `toString()` to convert the buffer to a string, while this replacement uses `slice()` which would remove the first character of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `toString()` to convert the buffer to a string, while this replacement uses `substr()` which would remove the first character of the string and return the rest of the string.

DONE.
