  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(1, otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.max` will always return at least 1, whereas `otherIter.peekLength()` could return 0. This could cause the `while` loop to execute an additional iteration when `length` is 0, which could modify the `retDelta` object in unexpected ways.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` will always return a positive value, whereas `otherIter.peekLength()` could return a negative value. This could cause the `while` loop to execute additional iterations when `length` is negative, which could modify the `retDelta` object in unexpected ways.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` will
