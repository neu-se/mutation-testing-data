 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment resolves the promise with the value passed to the `resolve` method, while this modification resolves it with `null`. This could cause issues if the consuming code expects a specific value other than `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of resolving the promise, it would reject it. This could cause the test suite to fail if there are no tests checking for rejection or if the consuming code does not handle rejections properly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.fulfill
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill` is not a method on the `deferred` object. The correct method is `deferred.resolve`. This would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown, causing the test suite to fail.
