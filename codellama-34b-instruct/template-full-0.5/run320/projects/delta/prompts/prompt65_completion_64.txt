  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = "";
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `newOp` is an object with an `insert` property, while the new code fragment `newOp.insert = ""` is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `newOp` is an object with an `insert` property, while the new code fragment `newOp.insert = 0` is a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `newOp` is an object with an `insert` property, while the new code fragment `newOp.insert = null` is null.

DONE.
