  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that is resolved with the result of the original promise, but it would not propagate the rejection of the original promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.catch(function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that is resolved with the result of the original promise, but it would also catch any errors that occur during the resolution of the original promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.finally(function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that is resolved with the result of the original promise, but it would also execute the finally callback regardless of whether the original promise was resolved or rejected.

DONE.
