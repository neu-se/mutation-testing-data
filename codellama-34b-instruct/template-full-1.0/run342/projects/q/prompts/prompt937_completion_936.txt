  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var baseArgs = array_slice(arguments, 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first two arguments passed to the function, which could cause the function to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var baseArgs = array_slice(arguments, 3);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first three arguments passed to the function, which could cause the function to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var baseArgs = array_slice(arguments, 5);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first five arguments passed to the function, which could cause the function to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
