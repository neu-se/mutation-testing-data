  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_resolved
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` and `reject` are inverse functions, so if `resolve` is called instead of `reject`, it would indicate that the promise has been successfully resolved, rather than rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `_rejected` expects an exception object as an argument, but passing `undefined` would cause it to receive no arguments, which could potentially cause it to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_resolved(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because `_resolved` expects a value as an argument, but passing an `Error` object would cause it to receive an object, which could potentially cause it to behave differently.

DONE.
