  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is expecting a string representing a timezone offset, but a number (0) is being returned instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is expecting a string representing a timezone offset, but an empty string is being returned instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is expecting a string representing a timezone offset, but undefined is being returned instead.

DONE.
