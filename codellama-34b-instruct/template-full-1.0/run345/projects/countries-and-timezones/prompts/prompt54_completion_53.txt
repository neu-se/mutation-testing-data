  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `timezones.slice()` creates a shallow copy of the `timezones` object, whereas `timezones` refers to the original object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.assign({}, timezones)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.assign({}, timezones)` creates a new object with the same properties as `timezones`, whereas `timezones` refers to the original object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones.filter(tz => tz.deprecated === true)
```
This would result in different behavior because `timezones` refers to the original object, whereas `timezones.filter(tz => tz.deprecated === true)` creates a new array containing only the deprecated timezones.

DONE.
