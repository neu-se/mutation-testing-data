 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Error("Different error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the type of error object created, which could affect how error handlers process the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it suppresses the error, causing the promise to be resolved instead of rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because it immediately resolves the promise with a value of undefined, instead of propagating the error.

DONE.
