  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(name).name
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the name of the timezone, rather than the timezone object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(name).timezones
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the list of timezones for the given country, rather than the timezone object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(name).countries
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the list of countries for the given timezone, rather than the timezone object itself.

DONE.
