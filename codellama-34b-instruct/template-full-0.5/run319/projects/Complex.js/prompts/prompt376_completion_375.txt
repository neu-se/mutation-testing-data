  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the square of `a`, while the new code calculates the square of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the square of `a`, while the new code calculates the sum of `a` and `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the square of `a`, while the new code calculates the difference of `a` and `b`.

DONE.
