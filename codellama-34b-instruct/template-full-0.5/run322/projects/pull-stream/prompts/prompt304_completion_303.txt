  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call, while the replaced code fragment `cb(null, data)` is a function call with arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(ended, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call with a single argument, while the replaced code fragment `cb(ended, data)` is a function call with two arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(data, ended)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call with a single argument, while the replaced code fragment `cb(data, ended)` is a function call with two arguments in a different order.

DONE.
