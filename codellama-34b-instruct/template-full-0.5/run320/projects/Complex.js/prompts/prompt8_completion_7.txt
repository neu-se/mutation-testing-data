  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `x` directly, while the modified code fragment uses `x + 1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `x` directly, while the modified code fragment uses `x * 2`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `x` directly, while the modified code fragment uses `Math.sqrt(x)`.

DONE.
