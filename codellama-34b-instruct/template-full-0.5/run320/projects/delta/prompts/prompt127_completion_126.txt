  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.next()` would return the next element in the iteration, rather than the current element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.previous()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.previous()` would return the previous element in the iteration, rather than the current element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.peek()` would return the next element in the iteration without advancing the iterator, rather than the current element.

DONE.
