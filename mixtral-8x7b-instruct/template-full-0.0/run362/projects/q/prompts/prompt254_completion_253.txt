 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array would be passed as the arguments to `newPromise.promiseDispatch`, which might cause unexpected results if the method expects a non-empty array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
42
```
This would result in different behavior because a number would be passed as the arguments to `newPromise.promiseDispatch`, which would cause an error as the method expects an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
message.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `message.slice()` creates a shallow copy of the `message` array. If any modifications are made to the `messages` array after this point, the `message.slice()` array would not be affected, which might cause unexpected results if the method expects the original `message` array.

DONE.
