  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 = λ1 + Δλ * cos(φ1)
```
This code fragment is a buggy version of the original code, as it does not take into account the latitude of the destination point. It will result in a different bearing calculation and may cause issues in the `calculateDestination` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 = λ1 + Δλ * sin(φ1)
```
This code fragment is another buggy version of the original code, as it does not take into account the longitude of the destination point. It will result in a different bearing calculation and may cause issues in the `calculateDestination` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 = λ1 + Δλ * cos(φ1) * sin(φ2)
```
This code fragment is a correct version of the original code, as it takes into account the latitude and longitude of the destination point. It will result in
