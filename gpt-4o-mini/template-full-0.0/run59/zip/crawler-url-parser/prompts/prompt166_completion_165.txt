Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff == 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for a positive difference in part counts, which would incorrectly classify a link as "sublevel" when it should not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it allows for any positive difference, potentially misclassifying links that are not in a sublevel relationship as such.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff != -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would classify any part count difference that is not -1, including 0 and positive values, leading to incorrect classifications of link levels.

DONE.
