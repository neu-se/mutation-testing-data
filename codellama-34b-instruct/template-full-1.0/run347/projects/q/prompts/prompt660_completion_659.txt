  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fapply
```
This would result in different behavior because `fapply` is a different function that takes a different set of arguments than `dispatch`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
get
```
This would result in different behavior because `get` is a different function that retrieves a property value instead of invoking a method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
post
```
This would result in different behavior because `post` is a different function that sends a message to a target object instead of invoking a method.

DONE.
