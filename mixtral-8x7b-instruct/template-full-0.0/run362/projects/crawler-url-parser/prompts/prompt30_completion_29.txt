 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'http' + currentUrlStr.slice(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it prepends 'http' to the currentUrlStr instead of using the correct replace method to add 'http://' at the beginning of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrlStr.replace(/\/\//, 'https:')
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces '//' with 'https:' instead of adding 'http://' at the beginning of the string, and also changes the protocol to 'https' instead of 'http'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrlStr.replace(/\/\//, '').replace(/^/, 'http://')
```
This would result in different behavior because it first removes '//' from the string and then adds 'http://' at the beginning of the string. This can lead to incorrect protocol assignment if the original string already starts
