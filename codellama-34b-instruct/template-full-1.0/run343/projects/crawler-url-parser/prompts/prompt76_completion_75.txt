  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function parse(currentUrlStr, baseUrlStr) {
  let ret = {};
  return ret;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the function will now always return an empty object, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const parse = (currentUrlStr, baseUrlStr) => {
  let ret = {};
  if (Math.random() > 0.5) {
    ret.url = URL.parse(currentUrlStr).href;
  }
  return ret;
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the function will sometimes return an object with a `url` property, and sometimes return an empty object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const parse = () => {
  throw new Error("Parsing error");
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the function will now always throw an error, regardless of the input.

DONE.
