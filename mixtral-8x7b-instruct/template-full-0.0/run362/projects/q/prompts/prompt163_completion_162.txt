 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
";\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an empty statement after the split, which would not affect the behavior of the filterStackString function directly, but it could potentially expose issues with how other parts of the code handle the output of this function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\n---\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the separator string used to join the filtered stack trace lines. This could potentially expose issues with how other parts of the code parse or handle the stack trace if they are sensitive to the separator format.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\n" + STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR + "\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the separator string to the value of STACK\_JUMP\_SEPARATOR, which is a constant defined earlier in the code. This could potentially expose issues with how other parts of the
