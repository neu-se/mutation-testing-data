  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op === "when" && operands[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the third operand instead of the second operand.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op === "when" && !operands[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the second operand is falsy instead of truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op === "when" && operands[1] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the second operand is equal to 0 instead of any truthy value.

DONE.
