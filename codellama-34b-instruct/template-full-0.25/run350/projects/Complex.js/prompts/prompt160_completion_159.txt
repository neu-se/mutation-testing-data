  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a method call, while the replaced code fragment is a function call. The method call would return a boolean value indicating whether the complex number is infinite, while the function call would return a new complex number with the same real and imaginary parts as the original complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a method call, while the replaced code fragment is an expression that adds 1 to the result of the method call. The method call would return a boolean value indicating whether the complex number is infinite, while the expression would return a boolean value indicating whether the complex number is infinite or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a method call, while the replaced code fragment
