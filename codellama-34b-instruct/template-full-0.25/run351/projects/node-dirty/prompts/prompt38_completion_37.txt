  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const [key, val] of this._data.entries()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because `entries()` returns an iterator of key-value pairs, whereas `for...of` iterates over the values of an iterable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const key in this._data) {
```
This would result in different behavior because `for...in` iterates over the keys of an object, whereas `for...of` iterates over the values of an iterable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const val of this._data.values()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because `values()` returns an iterator of values, whereas `for...of` iterates over the values of an iterable.

DONE.
