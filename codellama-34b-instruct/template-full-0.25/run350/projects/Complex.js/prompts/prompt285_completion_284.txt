  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative sign would cause the `cosh` function to return the negative of its original value, which would change the result of the `cos` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh(b) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the `cosh` function to return a value that is one greater than its original value, which would change the result of the `cos` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function would be called with the wrong argument, which would cause the `cos` function to return an incorrect result.

DONE.
