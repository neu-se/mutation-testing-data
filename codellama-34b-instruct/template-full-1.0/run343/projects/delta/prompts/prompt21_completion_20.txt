  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `isEqual` function from the `lodash` library to check for equality, while this code uses the strict equality operator `!==`. If the values being compared are objects or arrays, the `isEqual` function will perform a deep comparison, while the strict equality operator will only check if the two values are the same object reference.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual(b[key], a[key])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the values are not equal, while this code checks if the values are equal. This would cause the function to return the opposite result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isEqual(a[key], b[key]) || a[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the values are not equal, while this code checks
