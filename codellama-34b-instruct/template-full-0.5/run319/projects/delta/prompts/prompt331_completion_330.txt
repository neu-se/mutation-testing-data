  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would refer to the `insert` property of the `baseOp` object, rather than the `baseOp` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would refer to the `length` property of the `baseOp` object, rather than the `baseOp` object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new array containing the first element of the `baseOp` array, rather than referring to the `baseOp` object itself.

DONE.
