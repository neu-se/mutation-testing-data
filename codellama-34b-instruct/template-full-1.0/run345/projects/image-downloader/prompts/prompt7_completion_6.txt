extractFilename === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if the `extractFilename` option is present, while this code is checking if it is set to `false`. If the option is not present, the original code would still continue with the download, while this code would reject the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!extractFilename
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if the `extractFilename` option is `true`, while this code is checking if it is not `true`. If the option is not present, the original code would still continue with the download, while this code would reject the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
extractFilename != true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if the `extractFilename` option is `true`, while this code is checking if it is not `true`. If the option is not present, the original code
