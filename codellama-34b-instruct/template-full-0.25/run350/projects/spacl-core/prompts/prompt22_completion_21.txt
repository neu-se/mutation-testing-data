  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
super[Symbol.match]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `Symbol.match` method on the `super` object, which is not the same as calling the `Symbol.match` method on the `Matcher` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[Symbol.match]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `Symbol.match` method on the `this` object, which is not the same as calling the `Symbol.match` method on the `Matcher` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Matcher[Symbol.match]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `Symbol.match` method on the `Matcher` class, which is not the same as calling the `Symbol.match` method on an instance of the `Matcher` class.

DONE.
