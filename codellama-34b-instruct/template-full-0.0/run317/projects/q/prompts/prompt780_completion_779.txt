  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.inspect()` returns a promise for the state of the promise, whereas `regardless` is a function that returns the promise itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(noop, noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.then(noop, noop)` returns a promise that is resolved with the value of the original promise, whereas `regardless` is a function that returns the promise itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(noop, noop).then(noop, noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.then(noop, noop).then(noop, noop)` returns a promise that is resolved with the value of the original promise, whereas `regardless` is a function that returns the promise itself.
