 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[1, 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns a new array with the values 1 and 2, instead of using the input `point.coordinates`. This could cause tests to pass even when the input coordinates are not being processed correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns `null`, instead of using the input `point.coordinates`. This could cause tests to pass even when the input coordinates are not being processed correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
point.type
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the `type` property of the `point` object, instead of the `coordinates` property. This could cause tests to pass even when the input coordinates are not being processed correctly.

DONE.
