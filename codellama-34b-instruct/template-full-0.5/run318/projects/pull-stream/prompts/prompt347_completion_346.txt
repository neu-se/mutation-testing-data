  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a plain object, while `data.toUpperCase()` is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a plain object, while `data.length` is a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.hasOwnProperty('key')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a plain object, while `data.hasOwnProperty('key')` is a boolean.

DONE.
