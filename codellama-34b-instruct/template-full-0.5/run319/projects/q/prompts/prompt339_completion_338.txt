  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the state is "fulfilled" instead of "rejected".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the state is "pending" instead of "rejected".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "unknown"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the state is "unknown" instead of "rejected".

DONE.
