  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, val + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value stored in the database would be different, and the test cases that check for the correctness of the stored values would fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, val - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value stored in the database would be different, and the test cases that check for the correctness of the stored values would fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, "value"
```
This would result in different behavior because the value stored in the database would be a string "value", and the test cases that check for the correctness of the stored values would fail.

DONE.
