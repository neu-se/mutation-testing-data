  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT, which would negate the truthiness of the `data` variable, causing the `test` function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator is a concatenation operator, which would concatenate `data` with the number one, rather than checking if `data` is truthy or falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `data[0]` would retrieve the first character of the `data` string, which may not be the same as the original `data` variable.

DONE.
