  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra `null` argument is passed to the `dispatch` method, which could cause the method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra `undefined` argument is passed to the `dispatch` method, which could cause the method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, {}]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra empty object argument is passed to the `dispatch` method, which could cause the method to behave differently.

DONE.
