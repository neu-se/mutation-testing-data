Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to add 1 to the result of the operation, which would change the expected output if the operation returns a number, potentially leading to incorrect promise resolution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op].call(promise, args[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because it only calls the operation with the first argument from `args`, ignoring any additional arguments, which could lead to unexpected results or errors if the operation requires more than one argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op].apply(null, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the context of the function call to `null`, which may affect how `this` is handled within the operation, potentially leading to incorrect behavior if the operation relies on the promise instance as its context.

DONE.
