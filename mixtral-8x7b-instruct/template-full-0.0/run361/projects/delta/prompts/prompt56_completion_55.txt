 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
ops.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of the `ops` array, and any modifications to the `ops` array in the `push` method will not affect the original `ops` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
ops.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array with the same elements as the `ops` array, and any modifications to the `ops` array in the `push` method will not affect the new array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
ops.filter(op => op !== null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it filters out any `null` values from the `ops` array, which could potentially remove some of the operations in the delta.

DONE.
