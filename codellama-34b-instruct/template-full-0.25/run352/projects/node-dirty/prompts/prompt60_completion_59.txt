  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream
```
This would result in different behavior because the `writeStream` property is not defined in the `Dirty` class, and would therefore cause a `ReferenceError` when attempting to access it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size
```
This would result in different behavior because the `size` property is not defined in the `Map` class, and would therefore cause a `ReferenceError` when attempting to access it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.size
```
This would result in different behavior because the `size` property is not defined in the `Map` class, and would therefore cause a `ReferenceError` when attempting to access it.

DONE.
