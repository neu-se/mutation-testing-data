  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!rule.matches
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `matches` function, so if the original code was expecting `true`, the mutated code would return `false`, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.nonmatches
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nonmatches` function does not exist, so if the original code was expecting to call a function with that name, the mutated code would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule['matches']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `['']` syntax is used to access the property of an object with the specified name. In this case, the `matches` property does not exist, so the mutated code would return `undefined`.

DONE.
