  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
hasStacks === true;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to wrongly assume that the stack traces are available, leading to the wrong output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
hasStacks === false;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to skip the part that is responsible for capturing the current stack trace, leading to the wrong output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q === undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to throw an error, which would change the output of the program.

DONE.
