  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.longitude
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code fragment, but it uses the `longitude` property of the `point` object instead of the `latitude` property. This change may cause the `calculateDistance` method to return a different value than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.latitude + 1
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code fragment, but it adds 1 to the `latitude` property of the `point` object before using it in the calculation. This change may cause the `calculateDistance` method to return a different value than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.longitude * 2
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code fragment, but it multiplies the `longitude` property of the `point` object by 2 before using it in the calculation. This change may cause the `calculateDistance` method to return a different value than expected
