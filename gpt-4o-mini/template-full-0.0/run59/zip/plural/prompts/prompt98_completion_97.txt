Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.split(/a/).join('e')
```
This would result in different behavior because this code splits the word at every occurrence of 'a' and joins it back with 'e', which changes all 'a's to 'e's instead of just replacing the 'a' at the specified position.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because this code converts the entire word to uppercase, which does not perform any pluralization and alters the case of the word instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/a/, 'e')
```
This would result in different behavior because this code only replaces the first occurrence of 'a' with 'e', rather than applying a more complex transformation that might be intended for pluralization.

DONE.
