Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject("Error: All promises failed");
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of resolving with the fulfilled values of the promises, it would immediately reject the promise with a string error message, causing the caller to receive an error instead of the expected array of values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve([]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve with an empty array instead of the array of fulfilled promise values, which would mislead the caller into thinking that there were no fulfilled promises when there might have been.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(promises.slice(0, 1));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only resolve with the first promise's value instead of all fulfilled promise values, potentially losing important data from the other promises that were fulfilled.

DONE.
