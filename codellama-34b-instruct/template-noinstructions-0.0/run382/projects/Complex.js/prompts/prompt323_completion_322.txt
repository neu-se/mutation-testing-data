  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` and `Math.sin` have different return values for the same input, which would cause the `asin` and `acos` functions to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan` and `Math.sin` have different return values for the same input, which would cause the `atan` function to return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cot
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cot` and `Math.sin` have different return values for the same input, which would cause the `acot` function to return incorrect results.

DONE.
