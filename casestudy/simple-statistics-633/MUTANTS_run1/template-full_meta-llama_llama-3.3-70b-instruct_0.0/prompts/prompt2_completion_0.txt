Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof x!== "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the input `x` is not an object, which is a different condition than checking if the `sum` variable is not a number, potentially causing the function to return `NaN` for valid input arrays.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
x.length > 1000
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the length of the input array `x` is greater than 1000, and if so, returns `NaN`, which is an arbitrary condition unrelated to the original check for non-numeric `sum` values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
sum === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the initial `sum` value (which is the first element of the array) is exactly 0, and if so, returns `NaN`, which is a different condition than checking if `sum` is not a number, and could potentially cause the function to return `NaN` for valid input arrays that start with 0.
