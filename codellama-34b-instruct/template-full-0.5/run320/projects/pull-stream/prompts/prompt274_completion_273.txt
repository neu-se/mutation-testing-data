  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(stream)
```
This would result in different behavior because `once` is a function that returns a new stream that only emits a single value, whereas the original code fragment `once` is a function that returns a new stream that emits all values from the original stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
twice(stream)
```
This would result in different behavior because `twice` is a function that returns a new stream that emits all values from the original stream twice, whereas the original code fragment `once` is a function that returns a new stream that only emits a single value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
never(stream)
```
This would result in different behavior because `never` is a function that returns a new stream that never emits any values, whereas the original code fragment `once` is a function that returns a new stream that only emits a single value.

DONE.
