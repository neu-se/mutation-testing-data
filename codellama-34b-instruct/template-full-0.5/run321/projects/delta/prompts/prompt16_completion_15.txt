  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `b` is not an object, while this replacement checks if `b` is undefined. If `b` is undefined, the original code would still consider it an object and execute the code inside the `if` block, while this replacement would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `b` is not an object, while this replacement checks if `b` is not null. If `b` is null, the original code would still consider it an object and execute the code inside the `if` block, while this replacement would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Object.keys(b).length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `b` is not an object, while this replacement checks if `b` has no keys. If `b` has no keys
