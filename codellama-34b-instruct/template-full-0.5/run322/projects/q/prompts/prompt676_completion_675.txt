  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 1, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `dispatch` would be `[args]`, which is different from the original `[void 0, args]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, args.concat(1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `dispatch` would be `[args.concat(1)]`, which is different from the original `[void 0, args]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, args.slice(1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `dispatch` would be `[args.slice(1)]`, which is different from the original `[void 0, args]`.

DONE.
