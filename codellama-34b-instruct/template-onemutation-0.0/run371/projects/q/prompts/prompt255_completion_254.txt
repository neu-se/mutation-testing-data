  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise, message[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the first element of the `message` array as the second argument to `promiseDispatch`, instead of passing the entire `message` array. This could cause the promise to be resolved or rejected with an unexpected value, leading to unexpected behavior in the program.

DONE.
