  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.retain !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `nextOp.retain` is an object, while this fragment checks if it is not an object. If `nextOp.retain` is an object, this fragment would return `true`, even though the original code fragment would return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.retain === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `nextOp.retain` is an object that is not `null`, while this fragment checks if `nextOp.retain` is `null`. If `nextOp.retain` is an object that is not `null`, this fragment would return `false`, even though the original code fragment would return `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.retain !== null && typeof nextOp.retain !== 'object'
```
This would result
