Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

This would result in different behavior because it would return a different value than the original code snippet, which would always return a boolean value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

This would result in different behavior because it would return a different value than the original code snippet, which would always return a boolean value.
