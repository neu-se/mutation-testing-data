 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.filter((op) => op)
```
This would result in different behavior because it filters out any falsy values, including `0`, `null`, `undefined`, and empty strings, whereas the original code fragment filters out only elements that do not exist in the array (removed by a `filter` call with no callback function).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.filter(Boolean)
