  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` was not passed any arguments, while the new code fragment `cb(null, data)` passes two arguments, `null` and `data`, to the `cb` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` was not passed any arguments, while the new code fragment `cb(end)` passes one argument, `end`, to the `cb` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` was not passed any arguments, while the new code fragment `cb(data)` passes one argument, `data`, to the `cb` function.

DONE.
