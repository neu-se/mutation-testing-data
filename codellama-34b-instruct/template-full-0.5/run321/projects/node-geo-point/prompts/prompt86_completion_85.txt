  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `cos` and `sin` have different values, and the calculation of `sinφ2` would be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `tan` and `sin` have different values, and the calculation of `sinφ2` would be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
asin
```
This would result in different behavior because `asin` and `sin` have different values, and the calculation of `sinφ2` would be incorrect.

DONE.
