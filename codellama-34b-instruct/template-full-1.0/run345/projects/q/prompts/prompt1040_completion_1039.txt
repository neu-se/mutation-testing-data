  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().promise.then()
```
This would result in different behavior because `.then()` returns a new promise that resolves when the parent promise is resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all([Q.defer()])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all()` returns a new promise that resolves when all the promises in the array are resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` returns a new promise that is rejected.

DONE.
