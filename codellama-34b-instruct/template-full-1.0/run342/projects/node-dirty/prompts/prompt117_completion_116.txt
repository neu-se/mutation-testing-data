  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit(new Error('Invalid event type'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always emit an error event with the message "Invalid event type", rather than emitting the originally intended event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit(new Error('File not found'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always emit an error event with the message "File not found", rather than emitting the originally intended event.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('invalid');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always emit the event "invalid", rather than emitting the originally intended event.

DONE.
