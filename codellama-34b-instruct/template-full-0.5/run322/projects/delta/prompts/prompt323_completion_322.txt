  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `slice` method to start at the next index instead of the current index, potentially returning a different subset of the base delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `slice` method to start at the previous index instead of the current index, potentially returning a different subset of the base delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `slice` method to start at a different index than the current index, potentially returning a different subset of the base delta.

DONE.
