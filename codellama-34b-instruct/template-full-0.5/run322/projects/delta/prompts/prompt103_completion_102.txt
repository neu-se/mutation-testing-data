  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the `ops` array, which would cause the `filter()` method to return a different set of operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.sort()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sort()` method sorts the elements in the `ops` array, which would cause the `filter()` method to return a different set of operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method returns a shallow copy of a portion of the `ops` array, which would cause the `filter()` method to return a different set of operations.

DONE.
