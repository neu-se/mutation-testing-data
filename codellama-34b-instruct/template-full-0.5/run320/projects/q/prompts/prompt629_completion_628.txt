  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key, value, 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument is being passed to the `set` method, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [value, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is being reversed, which could cause the `set` method to assign the value to the wrong property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key, value + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the value being assigned is being incremented by 1, which could cause the `set` method to assign a different value than expected.

DONE.
