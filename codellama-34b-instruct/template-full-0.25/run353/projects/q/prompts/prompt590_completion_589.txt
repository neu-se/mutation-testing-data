  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `makeGenerator.bind(this)` would create a new function with `this` bound to the current context, whereas `makeGenerator` would refer to the original function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `makeGenerator.call(this)` would call the `makeGenerator` function with `this` set to the current context, whereas `makeGenerator` would refer to the original function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.apply(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `makeGenerator.apply(this)` would call the `makeGenerator` function with `this` set to the current context and an empty argument list, whereas `makeGenerator` would refer to the original function.

DONE.
