  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the unary minus operator would negate the value of `b`, potentially causing a sign flip in the returned result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `b` would be incremented, potentially causing a different branch of the `if` statement to be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `b` would be doubled, potentially causing a different branch of the `if` statement to be executed.

DONE.
