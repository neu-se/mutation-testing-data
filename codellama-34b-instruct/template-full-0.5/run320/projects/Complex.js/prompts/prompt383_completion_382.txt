  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` is a different function from `Math.sin`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This would result in different behavior because `x` is a variable that is not defined in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan` is a different function from `Math.sin`.

DONE.
