  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver(deferred.resolve, deferred.reject, deferred.notify);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolver` function would not be called with the correct arguments, leading to unexpected behavior in the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver(deferred.reject, deferred.resolve, deferred.notify);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolver` function would be called with the arguments in the wrong order, leading to unexpected behavior in the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver(deferred.notify, deferred.reject, deferred.resolve);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolver` function would be called with the arguments in a different order, leading to unexpected behavior in the promise.

DONE.
