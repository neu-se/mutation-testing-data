  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"tar"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tar` format is different from the `zip` format, and the `tar` format is not supported by the `archiver` library.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"zip"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `zip` format is different from the `tar` format, and the `zip` format is not supported by the `archiver` library.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"gzip"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gzip` format is different from the `tar` and `zip` formats, and the `gzip` format is not supported by the `archiver` library.

DONE.
