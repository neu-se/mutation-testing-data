Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!currentUrlStr || _has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the logic to return `null` if `currentUrlStr` is falsy (like an empty string) or if it contains illegal characters, which is the opposite of the original intent.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.length < 5
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the length of `currentUrlStr` is less than 5, which would allow some invalid URLs to pass through if they are longer than 4 characters, unlike the original check for illegal characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr && !baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because it allows the function to return `null` if `currentUrlStr` is truthy but `baseUrlStr` is falsy, which could lead to valid URLs being incorrectly processed as invalid, diverging from the original check for illegal characters.

DONE.
