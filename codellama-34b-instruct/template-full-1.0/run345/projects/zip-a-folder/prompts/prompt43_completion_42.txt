  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
globPart[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only select the first part of the glob instead of the entire glob.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
globPart.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would select all but the first character of the glob instead of the entire glob.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
globPart.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would select the glob in lowercase instead of the original glob.

DONE.
