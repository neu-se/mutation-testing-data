  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clothes.concat(["shirt", "pant"])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only includes the word "clothes" in the array, while this new code fragment includes the words "shirt" and "pant" as well.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clothes.concat(["shirt", "pant", "sock"])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only includes the words "shirt" and "pant" in the array, while this new code fragment includes the word "sock" as well.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clothes.concat(["shirt", "pant", "sock", "dress"])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only includes the words "shirt" and "pant" in the array, while this new code fragment includes the words "sock" and "dress"
