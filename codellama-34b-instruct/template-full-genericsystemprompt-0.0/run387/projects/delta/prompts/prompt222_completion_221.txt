  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the diff function to compare the wrong strings, leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the diff function to compare a non-existent string, leading to an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0].split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the diff function to compare a different data structure, leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
