  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.resolve` returns a resolved URL string, whereas `URL.format` returns a formatted URL string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.parse` returns an object containing the components of a URL, whereas `URL.format` returns a formatted URL string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolveObject
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.resolveObject` returns an object containing the components of a resolved URL, whereas `URL.format` returns a formatted URL string.

DONE.
