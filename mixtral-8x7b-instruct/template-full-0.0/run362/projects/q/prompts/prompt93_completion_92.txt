 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because if the length of the array is 0, it will throw a TypeError when trying to access the first element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it will always use 1 as the basis for the reduction, regardless of the initial value provided or the contents of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it will use the sum of the current index and 1 as the basis for the reduction, rather than the first element in the array.

DONE.
