  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.value
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.value` is a public property of a promise object that provides the resolved value of the promise, whereas `promise.inspect` is a function that provides information about the state of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.isFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.isFulfilled` is a function that checks if a promise has been resolved, whereas `promise.value` provides the resolved value of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.then` is a function that is used to specify what should happen when a promise is fulfilled, whereas `promise.value` provides the resolved value of the promise.

DONE.
