  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength` returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, whereas `peekType` returns the type of the next operation. If the next operation is an `insert` or a `retain`, the `peekLength` method will return the length of the operation, whereas the `peekType` method will return the type of the operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!= thisIter.peekType
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the result of the `peekType` method, which returns the type of the next operation as a string. If the next operation is an `insert` or a `retain`, the `peekType` method will return the type of the operation as a string, and negating that string will result in a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() +
