  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would decrement `i` instead of incrementing it, potentially causing the loop to never terminate or to terminate at a different point than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would increment `i` by 2 instead of 1, potentially causing the loop to terminate at a different point than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = Math.max(0, i - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would decrement `i` only if it is greater than 0, potentially causing the loop to never terminate or to terminate at a different point than expected.

DONE.
