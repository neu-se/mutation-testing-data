  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `join` function to always return `x`, regardless of whether `x` and `y` are the same or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * y
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `join` function to return the product of `x` and `y`, which may not be the same as `x` itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + y
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `join` function to return the sum of `x` and `y`, which may not be the same as `x` itself.

DONE.
