  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.invert()
```
This would result in different behavior because `base.invert()` would return a new object with the keys and values inverted, whereas `base` would return the original object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `base.reverse()` would return a new object with the keys and values in reverse order, whereas `base` would return the original object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.sort()
```
This would result in different behavior because `base.sort()` would return a new object with the keys and values sorted, whereas `base` would return the original object.

DONE.
