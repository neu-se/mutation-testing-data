  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes, otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `AttributeMap.invert` function to use the attributes of the other operation, rather than the base operation, which could lead to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.attributes, op.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `AttributeMap.invert` function to use the attributes of the base operation, rather than the other operation, which could lead to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, op.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `AttributeMap.invert` function to use `null` as the base attributes, rather than the attributes of the base operation, which could lead to incorrect results.

DONE.
