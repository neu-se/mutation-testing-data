  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink(null, acc);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `sink` function with the `acc` variable as the second argument, which is not the same as the original code that called the `sink` function with the `data` variable as the second argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink(null, data);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `sink` function with the `data` variable as the second argument, which is not the same as the original code that called the `sink` function with the `acc` variable as the second argument.
