 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gettype` function would treat the `pageurl` or `linkurl` as null, and might throw an error or return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gettype` function would treat the `pageurl` or `linkurl` as an empty object, and might throw an error or return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
['test']
