 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return {}; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would always fulfill with an empty object instead of the original object passed to `Q.master()`. This change could cause issues if the returned promise's state or the original object's properties are relied upon later in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { throw new Error('Master error'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always reject the returned promise with an 'Master error' instead of resolving it with the original object. This change could cause issues if the returned promise's state or the original object's properties are relied upon later in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function (op, args) { return Q.reject(new Error('Master error')); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always reject the returned promise with an 'Master error' instead of
