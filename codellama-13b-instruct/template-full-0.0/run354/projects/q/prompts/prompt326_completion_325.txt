  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"op"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a variable name, while the new code fragment is a string literal. This could cause the code to behave differently, depending on how the variable is used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"op" + "op"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a variable name, while the new code fragment is a string literal. This could cause the code to behave differently, depending on how the variable is used.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"op" + "op" + "op"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a variable name, while the new code fragment is a string literal. This could cause the code to behave differently, depending on how the variable is used.

DONE.
