  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert === otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the insert values by reference instead of by value, which could cause the code to produce different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert !== otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the insert values by reference instead of by value, which could cause the code to produce different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert == otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the insert values by reference instead of by value, which could cause the code to produce different results.

DONE.
