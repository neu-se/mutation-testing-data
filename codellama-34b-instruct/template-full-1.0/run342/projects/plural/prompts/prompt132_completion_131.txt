  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.slice(rule)
```
This would result in different behavior because `type` returns the type of the provided object, while `word.slice(rule)` would return a substring of the `word` starting from the `rule` index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.test(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because `type` returns a string representing the type of the provided object, while `rule.test(word)` would return a boolean indicating whether the `rule` regex matches the `word`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!/ ufficiale /.test(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because `type` returns a string representing the type of the provided object, while `!/ ufficiale /.test(word)` would return a boolean indicating whether the word does not contain the string "offizielle".

DONE.
