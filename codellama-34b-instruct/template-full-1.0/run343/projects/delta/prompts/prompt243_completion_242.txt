  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function getEmbedTypeAndData(op) {
  return Object.keys(op.retain).shift();
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is expecting `op.retain` to be an object with a single key, while this code will return the first key in the object regardless of its name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function getEmbedTypeAndData(op) {
  return op.retain[Object.keys(op.retain)[0]];
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is expecting `op.retain` to be an object with a single key, while this code will return the value of the first key in the object regardless of its name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function getEmbedTypeAndData(op) {
  return op.retain.getType() + op.retain.getData();
}
```
