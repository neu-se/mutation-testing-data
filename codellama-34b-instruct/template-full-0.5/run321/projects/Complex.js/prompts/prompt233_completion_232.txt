  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (r + a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `sqrt` function to return a different result, potentially leading to errors in subsequent calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (r - b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `sqrt` function to return a different result, potentially leading to errors in subsequent calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (r - a - b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `sqrt` function to return a different result, potentially leading to errors in subsequent calculations.

DONE.
