Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finish', resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'finish' event is emitted when the writable stream has finished writing all data, which may not indicate that the zip archive has been finalized, potentially leading to incomplete or corrupted output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'error' event indicates that an error has occurred during the writing process, and resolving the promise in this case would incorrectly signal that the operation completed successfully, leading to misleading results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close', reject
```
This would result in different behavior because rejecting the promise on the 'close' event would indicate that the operation failed, even though the stream has successfully closed, which would misrepresent the success of the zipping process.

DONE.
