  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch.bind(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method returns a new function that is bound to a specific context, but in this case, the context is the same as the original function. This means that the new function would behave the same as the original function, but it would not be able to access the original function's context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch.call(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method calls a function with a specific context and arguments, but in this case, the context and arguments are the same as the original function. This means that the new function would behave the same as the original function, but it would not be able to access the original function's context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch.apply(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method calls a
