  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(null)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it passes `null` as the callback function to `then`, which will cause the promise to be resolved with the original value, but the callback function will not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(function() { throw new Error("Test error"); })
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it passes a function that throws an error as the callback function to `then`. This will cause the promise to be rejected with the error, and the callback function will not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(function() { return Q.reject(new Error("Test error")); })
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it passes a function that returns a rejected promise with an error as the callback function to `then`. This will cause the promise to be rejected with the error, and
