 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
stackLine.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` uses a regular expression and may return a different index or `-1` if no match is found.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
stackLine.match
