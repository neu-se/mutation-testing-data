  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.delete === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator would now be comparing the `delete` property of the `op` object to the string `'string'`, which would always evaluate to `false`. This would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, and the `retain` property would always be returned, regardless of the value of the `length` parameter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` property of the `op` object would now be compared to the `undefined` value, which would always evaluate to `true`. This would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, and the `delete` property would always be returned, regardless of the value of the `length` parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete
