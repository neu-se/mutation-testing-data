Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisData === 'object' && thisData !== null && typeof otherData === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly checks if `otherData` is a string instead of an object, which would cause the transformation logic to be skipped when `otherData` is actually an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisData === 'object' && thisData === null && typeof otherData === 'object' && otherData !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly checks if `thisData` is `null`, which would lead to the transformation logic being skipped even when `thisData` is a valid object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisData === 'object' && thisData !== null && typeof otherData === 'object' && otherData === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it allows the transformation logic to proceed even when `otherData` is `null`, which could lead to unexpected results or errors during the transformation process.

DONE.
