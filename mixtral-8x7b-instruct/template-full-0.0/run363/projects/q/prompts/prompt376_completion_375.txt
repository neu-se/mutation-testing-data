 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` immediately resolves the promise with the progress value, bypassing the original logic of checking if the progress value is a promise and handling it accordingly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` immediately rejects the promise with the progress value, which is not the intended behavior in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
console.log
```
This would result in different behavior because it logs the progress value to the console instead of passing it along the promise chain. This change would break the intended flow of the code and not propagate the progress value to the next `then` or `tap` call.

DONE.
