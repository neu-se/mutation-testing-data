  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would increment the key value by 1, which would cause the `get` method to return a different value than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator would double the key value, which would cause the `get` method to return a different value than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operator would decrement the key value by 1, which would cause the `get` method to return a different value than the original code fragment.

DONE.
