  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler(thisOp[action])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getHandler` method on the `Delta` class with the value of `thisOp[action]`, which is an object that contains the `retain` property. This would likely cause an error, as the `getHandler` method is not defined on the `Delta` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler(otherOp.retain)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getHandler` method on the `Delta` class with the value of `otherOp.retain`, which is a number. This would likely cause an error, as the `getHandler` method is not defined on the `Delta` class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler(thisOp.retain)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getHandler` method on the
