 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
index > length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would not check the current index against the length anymore, causing it to potentially access an undefined index in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
index + 1 > length
