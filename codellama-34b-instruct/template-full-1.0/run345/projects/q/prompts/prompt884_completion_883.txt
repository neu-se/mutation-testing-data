  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.nfapply
```
This would result in different behavior because `nfapply` is a different method that uses a different implementation for handling the callback function, which may result in different behavior or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.post
```
This would result in different behavior because `post` is a different method that sends a request to a server and returns a promise of a response, which is different from the behavior of `nfapply`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.nbind
```
This would result in different behavior because `nbind` is a different method that binds a callback function to a promise, which is different from the behavior of `nfapply`.

DONE.
