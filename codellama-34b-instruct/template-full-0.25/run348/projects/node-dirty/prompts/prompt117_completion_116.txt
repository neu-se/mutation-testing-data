  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('write_close');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is called with a different event name, which may not be handled by the event listener.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('write_close'));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is called with a different event name and an error object, which may not be handled by the event listener.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', 'write_close');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is called with a different event name and an additional argument, which may not be handled by the event listener.

DONE.
