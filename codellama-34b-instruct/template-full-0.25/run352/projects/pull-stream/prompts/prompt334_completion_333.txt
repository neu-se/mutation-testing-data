  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && data
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only passes `end` to the callback, while this new code fragment passes both `end` and `data`. This could cause the callback to be called with a different set of arguments, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || data
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only passes `end` to the callback if `end` is truthy, while this new code fragment passes `data` to the callback if `end` is falsy. This could cause the callback to be called with a different set of arguments, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only passes `end` to the callback if `end` is falsy, while this new code fragment passes `end` to the callback if `end` is truthy. This could
