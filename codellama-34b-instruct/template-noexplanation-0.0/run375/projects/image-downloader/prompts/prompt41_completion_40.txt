  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This change will cause the promise to resolve instead of rejecting, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that uses this function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('Timeout Error')
```
This change will cause the function to throw an error instead of rejecting the promise, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that uses this function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log('Timeout Error')
```
This change will cause the function to log an error message to the console instead of rejecting the promise, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that uses this function.

DONE.
