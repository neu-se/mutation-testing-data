  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator).then(function () { throw new Error("test"); });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is not present in the original code, and it would cause the promise to be rejected with an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator).catch(function () { throw new Error("test"); });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch` method is not present in the original code, and it would cause the promise to be rejected with an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator).finally(function () { throw new Error("test"); });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finally` method is not present in the original code, and it would cause the promise to be rejected with an error.

DONE.
