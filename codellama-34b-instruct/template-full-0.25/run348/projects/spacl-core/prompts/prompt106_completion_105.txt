  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.match
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is a method that checks if a string matches a regular expression, whereas `matches` is a method that checks if a string matches a pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.match(path, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is a method that checks if a string matches a regular expression, whereas `matches` is a method that checks if a string matches a pattern. Additionally, `match` takes two arguments, a string and a regular expression, whereas `matches` takes three arguments, a string, a pattern, and a query context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.match(path, ctx, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is a method that checks if a string matches a regular expression, whereas `matches` is a method that checks if a string matches a pattern. Additionally, `match` takes two arguments,
