  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection", reason[0], promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reason` parameter is an array containing the rejection reason, and accessing the first element of the array would result in a different value than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection", reason.length, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reason` parameter is an array containing the rejection reason, and accessing the `length` property would result in a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection", reason.pop(), promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reason` parameter is an array containing the rejection reason, and using the `pop` method to remove the last element of the array would result in a different value than the original code.

DONE.
