 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
parseFloat(c)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would ignore the sign determined by `minus % 2` and always take the real part as a positive number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
parseFloat(c) * (minus % 2 ? -1 : 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly handle the sign for the imaginary part, potentially changing the value of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
tokens[i - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the previous token instead of the next one, causing incorrect parsing of the input string.

DONE.
