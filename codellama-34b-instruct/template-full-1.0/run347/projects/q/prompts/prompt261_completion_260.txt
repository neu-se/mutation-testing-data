  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolvedPromise` is a promise object, and it will never be equal to the boolean value `true`. Therefore, the condition would always evaluate to `false`, and the `fulfill` method would never be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.then(function() {
    return true;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolvedPromise` is a promise object, and it will always be resolved with a value that is not equal to `true`. Therefore, the condition would always evaluate to `false`, and the `fulfill` method would never be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
try {
    resolvedPromise.value();
} catch (error) {
    return true;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolvedPromise` is a promise object, and it will always be
