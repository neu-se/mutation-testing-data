  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb && function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the `cb` function would be called even if it is not defined. In the original code, the `cb` function would only be called if it is defined.

DONE.
