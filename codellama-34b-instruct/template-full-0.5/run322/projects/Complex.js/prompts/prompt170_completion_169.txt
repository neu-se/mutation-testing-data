  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `Complex['INFINITY']` for any input, instead of only for inputs that are equal to `Complex['INFINITY']`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `Complex['NAN']` for any input, instead of only for inputs that are equal to `Complex['NAN']`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `Complex['ZERO']` for any input with a real part of 0, instead of only for inputs that are equal to `Complex['ZERO']`.

DONE.
