  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect(true).state === "rejected";
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, even if the promise was not rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state === "fulfilled";
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, even if the promise was fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state !== "rejected";
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, even if the promise was rejected.

DONE.
