  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis + "foobar"
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the string "foobar" to the basis object, which would affect the output of the Array.prototype.reduce() method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis - 42
```
This would result in different behavior because it subtracts the number 42 from the basis object, which would affect the output of the Array.prototype.reduce() method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"cat"
```
This would result in different behavior because it completely replaces the basis object with the string "cat", which would cause the JavaScript engine to throw an error when trying to call the Array.prototype.reduce() method on a string.

DONE.
