  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `!` operator to check if the queue is empty, while this code fragment uses the `===` operator to check if the queue size is equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `!` operator to check if the queue is empty, while this code fragment uses the `>` operator to check if the queue size is greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `!` operator to check if the queue is empty, while this code fragment uses the `<` operator to check if the queue size is less than 0.

DONE.
