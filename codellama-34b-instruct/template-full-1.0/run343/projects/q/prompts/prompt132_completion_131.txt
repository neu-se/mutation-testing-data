  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the `toString` method to the `hasOwnProperty` method, which is a different method with a different purpose.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Function.prototype.call
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the `toString` method to the `call` method, which is a different method with a different purpose.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.push
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the `toString` method to the `push` method, which is a different method with a different purpose.

DONE.
