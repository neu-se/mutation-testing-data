  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is not calling the `_flush` method, which is likely to be important for the correct functioning of the `set` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush(key);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is not passing any arguments to the `_flush` method, while the modified code fragment is passing the `key` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush(val);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is not passing any arguments to the `_flush` method, while the modified code fragment is passing the `val` variable.

DONE.
