  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a, b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b, a` returns the arguments in the order they were passed in, while the new code fragment `a, b` returns the arguments in the reverse order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b, a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b, a` returns the arguments in the order they were passed in, while the new code fragment `a + b, a - b` returns the sum and difference of the arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b, a / b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b, a` returns the arguments in the order they were passed in, while the new code fragment `a * b, a / b` returns the product and quotient of the arguments.

DONE.
