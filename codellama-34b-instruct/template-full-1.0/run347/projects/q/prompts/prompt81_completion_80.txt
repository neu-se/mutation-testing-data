  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `laterQueue.pop` would pop the last item from the queue instead of pushing a new item.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `laterQueue.shift` would remove the first item from the queue instead of pushing a new item.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `laterQueue.unshift` would add a new item to the beginning of the queue instead of pushing a new item.

DONE.
