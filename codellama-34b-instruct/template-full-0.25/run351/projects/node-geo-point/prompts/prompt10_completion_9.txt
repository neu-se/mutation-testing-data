  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates') && point.coordinates.length === 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checks if the `coordinates` property exists, but this new code also checks if the length of the `coordinates` array is 2. If the `coordinates` array has a different length, the test will fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates') && point.coordinates.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checks if the `coordinates` property exists, but this new code also checks if the length of the `coordinates` array is greater than 0. If the `coordinates` array is empty, the test will fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates') && point.coordinates.length === 3
```
This would result in different behavior
