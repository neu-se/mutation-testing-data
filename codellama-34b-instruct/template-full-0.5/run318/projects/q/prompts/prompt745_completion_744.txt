  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `onFulfilled` is a different function than `onRejected`, and it would be called when the promise is fulfilled instead of when it is rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onProgress
```
This would result in different behavior because `onProgress` is a different function than `onRejected`, and it would be called when the promise makes progress instead of when it is rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onResolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `onResolve` is a different function than `onRejected`, and it would be called when the promise is resolved (either fulfilled or rejected) instead of when it is rejected.

DONE.
