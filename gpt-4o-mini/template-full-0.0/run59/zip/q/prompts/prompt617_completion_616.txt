Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to call the "set" operation instead of the "get" operation, leading to an attempt to set a property rather than retrieve it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invoke the "delete" operation, which is intended to remove a property, rather than fetching the value of a property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"invoke"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would try to invoke a method on the object instead of retrieving a property value, which would lead to a different operation being executed altogether.

DONE.
