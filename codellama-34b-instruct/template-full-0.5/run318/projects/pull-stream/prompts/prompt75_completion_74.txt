  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done && function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the `function () {}` would be executed only if `done` is truthy, whereas in the original code, it would be executed regardless of the value of `done`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done ? function () {} : function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `?:` operator has a higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the second `function () {}` would be executed only if `done` is falsy, whereas in the original code, it would be executed regardless of the value of `done`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done ? function () {} : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `?:` operator has a higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the second `function () {}` would be executed only if
