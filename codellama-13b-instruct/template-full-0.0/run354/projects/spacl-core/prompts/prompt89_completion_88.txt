  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(policy) => [policy.name, policy]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the spread operator to create an array from the `policy` object, while the modified code fragment uses the `Object.entries()` method to create an array of key-value pairs from the `policy` object. This would result in different behavior if the `policy` object has properties that are not enumerable or if the `Object.entries()` method is not supported in the environment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(policy) => [policy.name, policy.name]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `policy.name` property to create an array of key-value pairs, while the modified code fragment uses the `policy.name` property twice to create an array of strings. This would result in different behavior if the `policy.name` property is not a string or if the `policy` object has a different structure.

Option 3: The PLACEHOL
