 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
args
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` object is not passed as the first argument to the `apply` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[this, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` object is passed as the first argument, but not wrapped in an array as required by the `apply` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[[], args]
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array is passed as the first argument instead of the `this` object.

DONE.
