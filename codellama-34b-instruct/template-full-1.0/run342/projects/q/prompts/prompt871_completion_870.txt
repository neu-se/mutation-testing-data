  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nfapply` method is expected to receive an array as its argument, but with `0` it would receive a number instead, which would cause a type error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nfapply` method is expected to receive an array as its argument, but with `undefined` it would receive a missing value instead, which would cause a type error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nfapply` method is expected to receive an array as its argument, but with `null` it would receive a null value instead, which would cause a type error.

DONE.
