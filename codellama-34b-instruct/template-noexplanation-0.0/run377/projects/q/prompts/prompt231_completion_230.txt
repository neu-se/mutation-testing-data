  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListeners.pop
```
This code fragment will cause the `progressListeners` array to be modified in a way that is different from the original code, which could potentially cause the program to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListeners.shift
```
This code fragment will also cause the `progressListeners` array to be modified in a way that is different from the original code, which could potentially cause the program to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListeners.unshift
```
This code fragment will also cause the `progressListeners` array to be modified in a way that is different from the original code, which could potentially cause the program to behave differently.

DONE.
