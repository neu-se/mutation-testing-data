  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a promise, while this replacement returns a resolved promise with the value 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Something went wrong");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a promise, while this replacement throws an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Promise.reject(new Error("Something went wrong"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a promise, while this replacement returns a rejected promise with the error "Something went wrong".

DONE.
