  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ /g, EOL
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/ /g` matches all spaces, not just newlines, and the replacement string `EOL` is a newline character, not a space.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ /g, ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/ /g` matches all spaces, not just newlines, and the replacement string `' '` is a space character, not a newline.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ /g, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/ /g` matches all spaces, not just newlines, and the replacement string `''` is an empty string, not a newline.

DONE.
