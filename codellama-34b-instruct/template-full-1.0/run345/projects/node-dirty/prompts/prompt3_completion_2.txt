  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof val === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator returns a string value of the type of the operand, while the `===` operator only returns `true` if the operands are strictly equal. In this case, `undefined` is a primitive value, and `typeof val === 'undefined'` would return true if `val` is strictly equal to the `undefined` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val === undefined || val === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator does not compare for nullity. In this case, if `val` is `null`, it would not be caught by the original `val === undefined` expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!val
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator converts its operand to a boolean value and then inverts it. In this case, if `val` is `null` or `
