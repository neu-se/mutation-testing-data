  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.then()
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.then()` is a different method than `Q.isFulfilled(object)` and will have a different return value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.isFulfilled()
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.isFulfilled()` is a different method than `Q.isFulfilled(object)` and will have a different return value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value than `object` and will cause a type error when trying to access the `then` method.

DONE.
