  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `next()` method on the `this` object, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.next.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `next()` method on the `this` object, but it would also set the `this` context of the method to the `this` object, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.next.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `next()` method on the `this` object, but it would set the `this` context of the method to `null`, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

DONE.
