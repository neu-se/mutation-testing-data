Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.parse` returns an object representing the parsed URL, while `URL.format` converts a URL object back into a string format, which is necessary for the subsequent processing in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.resolve` combines a base URL with a relative URL to produce an absolute URL, whereas `URL.format` is used to create a string representation of a URL object, which would not yield the correct URL string needed for further operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because accessing `parsedBaseUrl.host` would return only the host part of the URL, rather than the complete URL string that `URL.format` provides, leading to incomplete or incorrect URL information in the `ret` object.

DONE.
