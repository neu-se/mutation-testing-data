  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-elem.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because the unary negation operator would change the operand from a positive integer to a negative integer, potentially causing a different branch of the `if` statement to be taken.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.delete * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operator would modify the operand, potentially causing a different branch of the `if` statement to be taken.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.delete + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition operator would modify the operand, potentially causing a different branch of the `if` statement to be taken.

DONE.
