  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!predicate
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator inverts the value of the `predicate` function, causing the `eachLine` method to skip rows if the `predicate` function returns a truthy value, and to perform the desired action (collect lines into a Delta object) when the predicate returns falsey value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (predicate(line, iter.next().attributes, i))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement is checking for a truthy value, so the method will only collect lines when the `predicate` function returns a truthy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
switch (predicate(line, iter.next().attributes, i))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `switch` statement checks the return value of the `predicate` function against a set of constant values, and only collects lines when the return
