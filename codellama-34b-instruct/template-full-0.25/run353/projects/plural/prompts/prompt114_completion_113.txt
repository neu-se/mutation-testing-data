  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
games.concat(clothes)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only includes the `games` array, while the new code fragment includes both the `games` and `clothes` arrays.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
games.concat(clothes).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include the `reverse()` method, while the new code fragment does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
games.concat(clothes).slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include the `slice()` method, while the new code fragment does.

DONE.
