  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!data
```
This would result in different behavior because `!data` is always `false` when `data` is an object, while the original code fragment `data` would return the object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `data.length` would return the length of the object, while the original code fragment `data` would return the object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `data[0]` would return the first element of the object, while the original code fragment `data` would return the object itself.

DONE.
