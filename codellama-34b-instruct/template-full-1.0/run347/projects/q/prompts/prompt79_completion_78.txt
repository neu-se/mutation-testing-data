  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setTimeout` callback will be executed one millisecond later than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setTimeout` callback will be executed one millisecond earlier than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1000
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setTimeout` callback will be executed one second later than the original code.

DONE.
