  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let part = spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse()[0];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first part of the path, instead of all parts.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let part = spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().join('/');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the parts of the path and then join them with slashes, instead of considering each part separately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let part = spec.split('/').slice(1).reduce((a, b) => b + a, '');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reduce the parts of the path to a single string, instead of considering each part separately.

DONE.
