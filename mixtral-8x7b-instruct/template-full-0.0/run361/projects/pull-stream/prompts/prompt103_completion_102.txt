 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 * data
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the `data` by 1, which doesn't change the value, but the test suite should check for this kind of change to ensure that the test is actually checking the value of `data`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the `data` to a string before logging it. The test suite should check for this kind of change to ensure that the test is handling different data types correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data || 'default value'
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a default value if `data` is falsy. The test suite should check for this kind of change to ensure that the test is handling edge cases correctly.

DONE.
