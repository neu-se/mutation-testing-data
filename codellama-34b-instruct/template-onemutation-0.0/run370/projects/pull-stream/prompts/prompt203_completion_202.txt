  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `end` variable, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` regardless of the value of `end`. This would cause the `cb` function to be called with the `end` argument, which is not the intended behavior of the code.

DONE.
