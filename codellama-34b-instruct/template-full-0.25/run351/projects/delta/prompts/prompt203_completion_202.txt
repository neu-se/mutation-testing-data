  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` is a method that adds an element to the end of an array, whereas `concat` is a method that combines two arrays.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` is a method that removes the last element of an array, whereas `concat` is a method that combines two arrays.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` is a method that removes the first element of an array, whereas `concat` is a method that combines two arrays.

DONE.
