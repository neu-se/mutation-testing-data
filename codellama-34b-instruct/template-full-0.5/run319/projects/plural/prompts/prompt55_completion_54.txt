  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(regex, 'ves')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `replace` method with a regular expression, which replaces the first occurrence of the pattern with the replacement string. In this option, the regular expression is replaced with the string 'ves', which would result in the replacement string being used as the pattern for the `replace` method, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(regex.exec(w)[0], 'ves')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `replace` method with a regular expression, which replaces the first occurrence of the pattern with the replacement string. In this option, the `exec` method is used to extract the first match of the regular expression, and the match is used as the pattern for the `replace` method, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(regex.test(w
