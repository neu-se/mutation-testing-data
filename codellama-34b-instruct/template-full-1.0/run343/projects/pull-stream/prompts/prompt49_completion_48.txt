  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i < length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would run one fewer times than the original code, potentially missing a function call or side effect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1; i <= length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would run one more time than the original code, potentially causing an out-of-bounds error or other type of issue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1; i < length + 1; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would run one more time than the original code, but the incremented variable would be checked against the original length value, preventing an out-of-bounds error.

DONE.
