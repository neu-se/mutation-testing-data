  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if(end) onEnd(end)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls the `once` function only if `onEnd` is defined, while the new code calls `onEnd` regardless of whether it is defined or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if(end) onEnd(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls `onEnd` with a single argument, while the new code calls it with two arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if(end) onEnd(end, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls `onEnd` with a boolean argument, while the new code calls it with a different boolean argument.

DONE.
