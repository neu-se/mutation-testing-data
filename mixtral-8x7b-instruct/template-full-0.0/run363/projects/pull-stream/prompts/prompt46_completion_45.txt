 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let i = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it declares `i` using `let` instead of `var`, making `i` block-scoped instead of function-scoped. This could cause issues if the rest of the code assumes `i` is function-scoped and modifies it later on.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const i = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it declares `i` as a constant. If any part of the code attempts to modify `i`, it will throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
window.i = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it declares `i` as a global variable instead of a local one. This could cause issues if other parts of the codebase also declare a global variable named `i`, leading to unexpected behavior due to variable shadowing.

DONE.
