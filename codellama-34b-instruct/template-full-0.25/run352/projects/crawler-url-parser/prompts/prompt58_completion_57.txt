  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would return `null` instead of a parsed URL object, which would cause the `extract` function to return an empty array instead of an array of URLs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!parsedUrl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would return a parsed URL object with a `protocol` property set to `null`, which would cause the `extract` function to return an array of URLs with a `protocol` property set to `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.protocol == 'https:'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would return a parsed URL object with a `protocol` property set to `https:`, which would cause the `extract` function to return an array of URLs with a `protocol` property set to `https:`.

DONE.
