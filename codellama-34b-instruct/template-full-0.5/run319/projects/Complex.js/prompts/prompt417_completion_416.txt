  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === 0 && this['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the complex number is zero, while this code fragment checks if the real and imaginary parts are both zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === 0 || this['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the complex number is zero, while this code fragment checks if either the real or imaginary part is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === 0 && this['im'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the complex number is zero, while this code fragment checks if the real part is zero and the imaginary part is non-zero.

DONE.
