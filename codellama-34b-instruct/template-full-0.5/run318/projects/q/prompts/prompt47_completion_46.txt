  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!domain
```
This would result in different behavior because `!domain` would be always `false`, unlike the original code fragment which would be `true` if `domain` is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain && false
```
This would result in different behavior because `domain && false` would be always `false`, unlike the original code fragment which would be `true` if `domain` is defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain || true
```
This would result in different behavior because `domain || true` would be always `true`, unlike the original code fragment which would be `false` if `domain` is not defined.

DONE.
