  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(this instanceof Complex)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `instanceof` operator checks if the object is an instance of the specified class, and the `!` operator negates the result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this instanceof Number
```
This would result in different behavior because the `instanceof` operator checks if the object is an instance of the specified class, and `Number` is a class that represents a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this instanceof Object
```
This would result in different behavior because the `instanceof` operator checks if the object is an instance of the specified class, and `Object` is a class that represents a generic object.

DONE.
