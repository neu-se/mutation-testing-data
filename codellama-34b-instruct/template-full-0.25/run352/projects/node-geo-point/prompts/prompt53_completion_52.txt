  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 180` would change the bearing calculation, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would double the bearing calculation, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ - 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 180` would change the bearing calculation, potentially leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
