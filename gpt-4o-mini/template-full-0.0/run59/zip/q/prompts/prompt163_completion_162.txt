Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
";"
```
This would result in different behavior because using a semicolon as a delimiter would cause the `stackString` to be split incorrectly, potentially resulting in an empty string or unexpected behavior in the filtering process.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
","
```
This would result in different behavior because using a comma as a delimiter would split the `stackString` at commas instead of new lines, leading to incorrect parsing of the stack trace and potentially losing important stack information.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "
```
This would result in different behavior because splitting the `stackString` by spaces would create an array of words rather than lines, which would disrupt the intended structure of the stack trace and likely result in an incorrect or unusable output.

DONE.
