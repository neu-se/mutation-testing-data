  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` is a different method than `split`, and it would produce a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` is a different method than `split`, and it would produce a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.lastIndexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastIndexOf` is a different method than `split`, and it would produce a different output.

DONE.
