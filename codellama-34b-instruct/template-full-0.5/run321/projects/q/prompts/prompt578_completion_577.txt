  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer, "next"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "next" method is not defined in the `continuer` function, so it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer, "send"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "send" method is defined in the `continuer` function, but it would not be called with the correct arguments, so it would not have the intended effect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer, "throw"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "throw" method is defined in the `continuer` function, but it would not be called with the correct arguments, so it would not have the intended effect.

DONE.
