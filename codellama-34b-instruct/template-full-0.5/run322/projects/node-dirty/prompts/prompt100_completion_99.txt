  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(`Could not load corrupted row: ${key}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `rowStr` to construct the error message, while this code fragment uses `key`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(`Could not load corrupted row: ${val}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `rowStr` to construct the error message, while this code fragment uses `val`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(`Could not load corrupted row: ${this._data.get(key)}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `rowStr` to construct the error message, while this code fragment uses `this._data.get(key)` to get the value associated with the key.

DONE.
