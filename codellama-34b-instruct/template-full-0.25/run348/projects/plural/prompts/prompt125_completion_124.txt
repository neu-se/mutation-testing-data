```
/\b(?:tea|sugar|water|air|rice|knowledge|beauty|anger|fear|love|money|research|safety|evidence)\b/i, function(w) { return w.toUpperCase() }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the word to uppercase, whereas the original code fragment would return the word as is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:tea|sugar|water|air|rice|knowledge|beauty|anger|fear|love|money|research|safety|evidence)\b/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr()` method would return the word without its last character, whereas the original code fragment would return the word as is.

Option 3: The
