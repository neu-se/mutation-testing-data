  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file + '.json'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a file path, but the replaced code would result in a file path with an additional '.json' extension.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.replace('json', 'txt')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a file path with a '.json' extension, but the replaced code would result in a file path with a '.txt' extension.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a file path, but the replaced code would result in a file path that is missing the first character.

DONE.
