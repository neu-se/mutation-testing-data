 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'http://example.com'
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets a fixed absolute URL instead of using the parsed base URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
absoluteUrl.format()
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the `format()` method on the `absoluteUrl` object, which may change its string representation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
absoluteUrl.href
