  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nbind.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nbind.call` is a different method than `Q.nbind.apply`, and it would likely cause the code to fail in different ways.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nbind.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nbind.bind` is a different method than `Q.nbind.apply`, and it would likely cause the code to fail in different ways.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nbind.bind(Q.nbind.apply)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new function that would call `Q.nbind.apply` with the given arguments, but it would not call the `Q.nbind.apply` method directly. This could cause the code to behave differently if the `Q.nbind.apply` method is called with different arguments.
