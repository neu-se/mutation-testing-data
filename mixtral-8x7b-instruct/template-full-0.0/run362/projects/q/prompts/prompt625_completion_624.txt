 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` keyword refers to the current object, which may not be the desired `object` parameter in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a special value that represents the absence of an object, which is not the same as the `object` parameter in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q(null)
