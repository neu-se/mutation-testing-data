  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `deferred.reject` is used to reject the promise, which means that the promise chain will be broken and the error will be propagated. However, if we replace it with `deferred.resolve`, the promise will be resolved instead, which means that the promise chain will continue to run and the error will not be propagated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `deferred.reject` is used to reject the promise, which means that the promise chain will be broken and the error will be propagated. However, if we replace it with `undefined`, the promise will remain in a pending state, which means that the promise chain will continue to run and the error will not be propagated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `
