  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not call the `cb` function with any arguments, while this replacement does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not call the `cb` function with two arguments, while this replacement does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not call the `cb` function with two arguments in the reverse order, while this replacement does.

DONE.
