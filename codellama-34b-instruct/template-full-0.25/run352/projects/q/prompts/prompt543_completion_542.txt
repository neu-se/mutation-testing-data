  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, array
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, whereas `void 0` is the `undefined` value. In the original code, `void 0` is used to indicate that the `this` value should be `undefined` when calling the `fulfilled` function. If `null` is used instead, the `this` value will be `null` when calling the `fulfilled` function, which may cause unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, array
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value, whereas `void 0` is the `undefined` value. In the original code, `void 0` is used to indicate that the `this` value should be `undefined` when calling the `fulfilled` function.
