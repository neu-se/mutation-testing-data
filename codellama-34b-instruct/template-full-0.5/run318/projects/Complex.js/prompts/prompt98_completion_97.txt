  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] === 'j' || tokens[i + 1] === 'J'
```
This would result in different behavior because the check for the imaginary unit is now case-sensitive, so it would not match the string "i" or "I".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] === 'e' || tokens[i + 1] === 'E'
```
This would result in different behavior because the check for the imaginary unit is now checking for the string "e" or "E" instead of "i" or "I".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] === '+' || tokens[i + 1] === '-'
```
This would result in different behavior because the check for the imaginary unit is now checking for the presence of a plus or minus sign instead of the string "i" or "I".
