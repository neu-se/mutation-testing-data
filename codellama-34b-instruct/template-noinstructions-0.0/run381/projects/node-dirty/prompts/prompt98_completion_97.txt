  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'warn'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits an error event when the row is corrupted, while the new code would emit a warning event instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'info'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits an error event when the row is corrupted, while the new code would emit an informational event instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'debug'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits an error event when the row is corrupted, while the new code would emit a debug event instead.

DONE.
