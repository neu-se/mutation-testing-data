  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a specific `this` value, whereas the original code simply calls the `callback` function with no specific `this` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(this, [])
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` calls the `callback` function with a specific `this` value and an empty array of arguments, whereas the original code simply calls the `callback` function with no specific `this` value and no arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call(this, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` calls the `callback` function with a specific `this` value and a single argument of `0`, whereas the original code simply calls the `callback` function with no specific `this` value and no arguments.

DONE.
