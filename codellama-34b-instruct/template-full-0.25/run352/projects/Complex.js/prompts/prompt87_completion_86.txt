  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` function returns `true` if the argument is NaN, but the `!` operator inverts the result, so `!isNaN` would return `false` if the argument is NaN.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite` function returns `true` if the argument is a finite number, but the `isNaN` function returns `true` if the argument is NaN.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Number.isNaN` function returns `true` if the argument is NaN, but the `isNaN` function returns `true` if the argument is NaN or Infinity.

DONE.
