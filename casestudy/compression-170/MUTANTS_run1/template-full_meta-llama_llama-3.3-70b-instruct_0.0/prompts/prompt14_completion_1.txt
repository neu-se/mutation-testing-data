Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.statusCode + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the status code of the response would be incremented by 1, potentially changing the HTTP status code sent to the client.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
res.statusCode
```
This would result in different behavior because `res.statusCode` is being used instead of `this.statusCode`, which could lead to different behavior if `res` and `this` are not the same object in this context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
req.method === 'GET'? 200 : this.statusCode
```
This would result in different behavior because the status code would be set to 200 if the request method is GET, and to the original status code otherwise, potentially changing the HTTP status code sent to the client based on the request method.

DONE.
