  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'write_error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'write_drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different.

DONE.
