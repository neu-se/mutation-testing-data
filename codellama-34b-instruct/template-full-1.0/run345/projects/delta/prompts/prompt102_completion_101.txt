  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last operation from the ops array, rather than the last retain operation with no attributes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(-1, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last operation from the ops array, rather than the last retain operation with no attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(this.ops.length - 2, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last but one operation from the ops array, rather than the last retain operation with no attributes.

DONE.
