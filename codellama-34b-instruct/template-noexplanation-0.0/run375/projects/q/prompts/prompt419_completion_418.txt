  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.state
```
This change will cause the `isPending` function to always return `true`, as the `inspect` property is always defined, even if the promise is fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect().state
```
This change will cause the `isPending` function to always return `false`, as the `inspect` method is never called, and the `state` property is always undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.state()
```
This change will cause the `isPending` function to always return `false`, as the `state` property is always undefined, even if the promise is fulfilled or rejected.

DONE.
