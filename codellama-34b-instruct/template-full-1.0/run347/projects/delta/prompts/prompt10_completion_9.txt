  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` is not defined in the scope of the function, so it would return `undefined` instead of the expected object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an object, so it would return `undefined` instead of the expected object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not an object, so it would return `undefined` instead of the expected object.

DONE.
