  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(data.timezones)
```
This would result in different behavior because original code expects a `timezones` object, but the replacement code would return an array of strings (the keys of the `timezones` object).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.timezones.map(t => t.name)
```
This would result in different behavior because original code expects a `timezones` object, but the replacement code would return an array of strings (the `name` property of each timezone object).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(data.timezones)
```
This would result in different behavior because original code expects a `timezones` object, but the replacement code would return an array of timezone objects (the values of the `timezones` object).

DONE
