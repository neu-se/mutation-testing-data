  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { throw new Error(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would throw an error, causing the program to terminate.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return "Hello, world!"; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a string, which would be assigned to the `Q` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return `undefined`, which would be assigned to the `Q` variable.

DONE.
