  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This change will cause the `calculateDistance` method to return the wrong distance value, as it will use the sine of the angle instead of the cosine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 - cos
```
This change will cause the `calculateDistance` method to return a distance value that is always one meter shorter than the actual distance.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI - cos
```
This change will cause the `calculateDistance` method to return a distance value that is always one meter longer than the actual distance.

DONE.
