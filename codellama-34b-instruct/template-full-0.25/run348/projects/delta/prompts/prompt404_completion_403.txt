  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherData.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherData.length` is a number, while `otherData` is an object, and the `transform` method expects an object as its second argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherData.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherData.retain` is a function, while `otherData` is an object, and the `transform` method expects an object as its second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherData.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherData.insert` is a function, while `otherData` is an object, and the `transform` method expects an object as its second argument.

DONE.
