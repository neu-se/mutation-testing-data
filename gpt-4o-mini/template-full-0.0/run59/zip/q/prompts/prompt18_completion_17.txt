Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"invalid"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a function definition to be passed to `global.Q`, but passing a string will cause `global.Q` to be set to a non-function value, leading to runtime errors when `Q` is used later in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because setting `global.Q` to `undefined` will remove the `Q` global entirely, which may lead to errors when any part of the code attempts to access `Q`, as it will no longer be defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because assigning `null` to `global.Q` will also result in `Q` being a falsy value, which can lead to unexpected behavior or errors in any subsequent code that expects `Q` to be a valid function or object.

DONE.
