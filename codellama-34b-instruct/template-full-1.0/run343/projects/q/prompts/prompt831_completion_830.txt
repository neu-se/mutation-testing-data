By replacing `fulfilled` with `rejected`, the promise will always enter the `rejected` branch, regardless of its resolution state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

This would result in different behavior because when using `.then()`, the `fulfilled` branch is executed when the promise is resolved, while the `rejected` branch is executed when the promise is rejected. By replacing `fulfilled` with `throw new Error("error")`, we make the promise always enter the `rejected` branch with a specific error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort()
```
This would result in different behavior because when using `.then()`, the `fulfilled` branch is executed when
