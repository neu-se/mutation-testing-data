Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the new operation to be inserted one position after the last operation instead of at the correct index, potentially leading to incorrect ordering of operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always insert the new operation at the beginning of the operations array, disregarding the intended position based on the current index, which could disrupt the sequence of operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to insert the new operation at the end of the operations array, which could lead to unintended duplication or incorrect merging of operations if the last operation is not compatible with the new one.

DONE.
