  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("keys", [])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Q.keys` method to be called with an empty array as the second argument, which would return a promise that is already fulfilled with an empty array, rather than a promise that is fulfilled with the keys of the eventually settled object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("keys", ["a", "b", "c"])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Q.
