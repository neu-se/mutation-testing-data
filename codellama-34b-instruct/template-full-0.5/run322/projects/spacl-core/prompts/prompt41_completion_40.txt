  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the backslash character (`\`) is not a valid path separator in most file systems, so the regular expression would not match any valid paths.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the forward slash (`/`) is a valid path separator in most file systems, so the regular expression would match any valid paths that include a forward slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the backslash character (`\`) is not a valid path separator in most file systems, so the regular expression would not match any valid paths that include a forward slash.

DONE.
