  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.query(path, verb, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` method is called on the `policy` object, which is not the same as the original code fragment `policy.query`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.query(path, verb, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` method is called on the `policy` object, which is not the same as the original code fragment `policy.query`.
