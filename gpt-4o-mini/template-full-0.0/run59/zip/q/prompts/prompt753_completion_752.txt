Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all(this);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to resolve all promises in the array instead of returning the first resolved promise, potentially leading to a different outcome when promises are fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(this);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately reject the promise with the array of promises instead of resolving with the first fulfilled promise, causing all calls to `any` to fail regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(this[0]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always resolve with the first element of the array, ignoring the promise states and potentially returning a value that is not a promise, which could lead to incorrect handling of the promise's resolution.

DONE.
