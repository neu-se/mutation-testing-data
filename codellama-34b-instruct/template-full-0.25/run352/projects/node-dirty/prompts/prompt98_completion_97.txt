  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'warn'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method would now emit a warning event instead of an error event, which could potentially go unnoticed by the user.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'info'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method would now emit an informational event instead of an error event, which could potentially provide misleading information to the user.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'debug'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method would now emit a debugging event instead of an error event, which could potentially provide additional information to the user.

DONE.
