  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbs.slice()` creates a new array, whereas `cbs` is a reference to the original array. If the code that uses the `Dirty` class expects to receive a reference to the original array, it would receive a reference to the new array instead, which could cause unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbs.concat()` creates a new array that is the result of concatenating the elements of `cbs` with the elements of another array, whereas `cbs` is a reference to the original array. If the code that uses the `Dirty` class expects to receive a reference to the original array, it would receive a reference to the new array instead, which could cause unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.map()
```
This would result in different behavior because `c
