  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Custom error message");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment simply returns the `exception` object, whereas the modified code fragment throws a new error with a custom message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the `exception` object, whereas the modified code fragment returns `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the `exception` object, whereas the modified code fragment returns `undefined`.

DONE.
