  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] = /* void */
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was assigning a value to `z['im']`, while the replaced code fragment does not assign any value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `/* void */` comment to indicate that the value of `z['im']` should be ignored, while the replaced code fragment assigns a value of `0` to `z['im']`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] = NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `/* void */` comment to indicate that the value of `z['im']` should be ignored, while the replaced code fragment assigns a value of `NaN` to `z['im']`.

DONE.
