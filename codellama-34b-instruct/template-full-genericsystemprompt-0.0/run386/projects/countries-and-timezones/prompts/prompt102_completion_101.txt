  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(tzs).forEach(key => prev[key] = tzs[key]);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys()` returns an array of strings representing the keys of the object, while `Object.assign()` copies the values of all enumerable own properties from one or more source objects to a target object. In this case, the `forEach()` loop would iterate over the keys of the `tzs` object and assign each key to the `prev` object, resulting in a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(tzs).forEach(value => prev[value] = tzs[value]);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values()` returns an array of values of the object's own enumerable string-keyed properties, while `Object.assign()` copies the values of all enumerable own properties from one or more source objects to a target object. In this case, the `forEach()` loop would iterate over the values of the `tz
