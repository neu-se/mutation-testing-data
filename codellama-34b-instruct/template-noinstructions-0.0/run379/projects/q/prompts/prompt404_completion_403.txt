  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value in JavaScript, and it would be passed as the rejection reason to the `then` method, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the rejection handler is not designed to handle `null` values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a valid value in JavaScript, and it would be passed as the rejection reason to the `then` method, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the rejection handler is not designed to handle `undefined` values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("rejection")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error with the message "rejection", which would be caught by the `catch` method and passed as the rejection reason to the `then` method. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the rejection handler is not designed to handle errors.
