  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 'object'
```
This change will cause the function to return `b` if `a` is not an object, regardless of whether `b` is an object or not. This change will likely cause the function to return incorrect results in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== b
```
This change will cause the function to return `b` if `a` is not equal to `b`, regardless of whether `b` is an object or not. This change will likely cause the function to return incorrect results in some cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== null
```
This change will cause the function to return `b` if `a` is not null, regardless of whether `b` is an object or not. This change will likely cause the function to return incorrect results in some cases.

DONE.
