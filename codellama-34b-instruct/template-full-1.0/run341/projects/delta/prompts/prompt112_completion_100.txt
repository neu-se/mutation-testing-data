  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes ? {} : { retain: op.length }
```
This would result in different behavior because if the `op` object has an `attributes` property, an empty object would be returned, which would cause the `push` method to behave differently than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes ? { insert: op[insert] } : op
```
This would result in different behavior because if the `op` object has an `attributes` property, a new object with an `insert` property would be returned, which would cause the `push` method to behave differently than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes ? { retain: op.length } : op
```
This would result in different behavior because if the `op` object has an `attributes` property, a new object with a `retain` property would be returned, which would cause the `push` method to behave differently than expected.

DONE.
