  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ index: index + 1, value: progress }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` property would be incremented by 1, which could cause the `all` function to return a promise that resolves to an array with incorrect indices.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ index: index - 1, value: progress }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` property would be decremented by 1, which could cause the `all` function to return a promise that resolves to an array with incorrect indices.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ index: index * 2, value: progress }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` property would be multiplied by 2, which could cause the `all` function to return a promise that resolves to an array with incorrect indices.

DONE.
