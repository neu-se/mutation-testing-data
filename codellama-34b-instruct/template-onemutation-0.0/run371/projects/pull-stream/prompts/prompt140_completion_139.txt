  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, generate())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `cb` function with the `end` argument, while the new code fragment calls the `cb` function with both the `end` and `generate()` arguments. This change would cause the test suite to fail if it relies on the `cb` function being called with only the `end` argument.
