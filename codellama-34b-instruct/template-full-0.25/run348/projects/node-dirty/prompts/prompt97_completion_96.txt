  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error(`Could not load corrupted row: ${rowStr}`));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits an error event with a specific message, while the modified code emits an error event with a different message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error(`Could not load corrupted row: ${rowStr.slice(0, 10)}`));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits an error event with the entire corrupted row, while the modified code emits an error event with only the first 10 characters of the corrupted row.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error(`Could not load corrupted row: ${rowStr.toUpperCase()}`));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits an error event with the corrupted row in its original case, while
