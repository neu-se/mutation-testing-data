  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.message = stack;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeStackTraceLong` function sets the `stack` property of the error object to a concatenation of the error's original stack trace and the stack trace of the promise. Using `error.message = stack` would instead overwrite the error message with the stack trace, potentially hiding the original error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stack = error.stack;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `stack` variable to the error's stack trace instead of the concatenated stack trace of the error and the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.stack = stack;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `stack` property of the error object to the concatenated stack trace of the error and the promise, potentially overriding the original stack trace.

DONE.
