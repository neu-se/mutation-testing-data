  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flushing
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always be true, causing the `requestTick` function to be called repeatedly, leading to an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!flushing && laterQueue.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only call the `requestTick` function if the `laterQueue` array has a length greater than 0, which would cause the `nextTick.runAfter` function to only run if there are tasks in the queue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof laterQueue !== 'undefined' && laterQueue.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only call the `requestTick` function if the `laterQueue` array exists and has a length greater than 0, which would cause the `nextTick.runAfter` function to only run if there are tasks in the queue.

DONE
