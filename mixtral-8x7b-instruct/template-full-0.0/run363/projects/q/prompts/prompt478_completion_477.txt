 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unhandledRejections.splice(at, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the rejected promise will not be removed from the `unhandledRejections` array, causing it to grow without bound.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unhandledRejections.splice(at, unhandledRejections.length);
```
This would result in different behavior because all the rejected promises in the `unhandledRejections` array will be removed, even those that have already been handled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unhandledReasons.splice(at, <PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the corresponding error message will not be removed from the `unhandledReasons` array, causing it to grow without bound.

DONE.
