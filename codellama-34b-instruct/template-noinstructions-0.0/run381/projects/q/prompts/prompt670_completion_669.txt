  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, args, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `args` array twice to the `dispatch` method, which would likely cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, args, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the third argument to the `dispatch` method, which would likely cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, args, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `undefined` as the third argument to the `dispatch` method, which would likely cause an error.

DONE.
