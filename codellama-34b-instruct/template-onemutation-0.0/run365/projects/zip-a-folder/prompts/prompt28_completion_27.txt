  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` event is emitted when the archive is fully written, while the `close` event is emitted when the archive is closed, but not necessarily fully written. Using `end` instead of `close` could cause the program to exit before the archive is fully written, potentially resulting in a corrupted or incomplete archive.
