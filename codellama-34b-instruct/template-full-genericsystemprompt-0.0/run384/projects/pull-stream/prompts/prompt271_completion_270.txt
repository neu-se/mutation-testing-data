  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `stream.values` would return an array of values from the stream, whereas `values` would return the values from the current stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.map(function(x) { return x * 2; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `stream.map` would apply the function to each value in the stream, whereas `values` would return the values from the current stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.filter(function(x) { return x > 0; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `stream.filter` would return a new stream containing only the values that pass the filter function, whereas `values` would return the values from the current stream.

DONE.
