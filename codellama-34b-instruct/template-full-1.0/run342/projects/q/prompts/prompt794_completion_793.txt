  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"string"
```
This would result in different behavior because "string" is a truthy value, while void 0 is a falsy value, which could lead to different control flow in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because true is a truthy value, while void 0 is a falsy value, which could lead to different control flow in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because false is a falsy value, while void 0 is a falsy value, which could lead to different control flow in the code.

DONE.
