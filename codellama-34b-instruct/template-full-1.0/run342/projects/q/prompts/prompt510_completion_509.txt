  
Option 1:  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be passing the promise object instead of the array of arguments.

Option 2:  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be passing a promise for the array of arguments instead of the array itself.

Option 3:  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be passing the keys of the arguments object, instead of the array of arguments values itself.

DONE.
