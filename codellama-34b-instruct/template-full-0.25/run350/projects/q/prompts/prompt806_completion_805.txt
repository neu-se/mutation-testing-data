  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall()
```
This would result in different behavior because `fcall()` is a method that calls a function with the given arguments, but it does not return a promise, so the returned promise from `Q.finally()` would not be resolved with the value returned by the callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall().then()
```
This would result in different behavior because `fcall().then()` is a method that calls a function with the given arguments and returns a promise that is resolved with the value returned by the callback. However, the returned promise from `Q.finally()` would not be resolved with the value returned by the callback, because the `then()` method returns a new promise that is resolved with the value returned by the callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall().then(function (value) { return value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `fcall().then(function (value
