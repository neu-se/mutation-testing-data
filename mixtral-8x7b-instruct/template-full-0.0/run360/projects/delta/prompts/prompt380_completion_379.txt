 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method of the `delta` object would receive a `null` value instead of an operation object, potentially causing unexpected behavior or errors in the code that consumes the `Delta` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
otherIter.peek()
