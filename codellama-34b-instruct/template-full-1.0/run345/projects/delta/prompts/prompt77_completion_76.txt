  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `lastOp` is an object, but the replaced code fragment would check if `lastOp` is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `lastOp` is an object, but the replaced code fragment would check if `lastOp` is a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `lastOp` is an object, but the replaced code fragment would check if `lastOp` is null or undefined.

DONE.
