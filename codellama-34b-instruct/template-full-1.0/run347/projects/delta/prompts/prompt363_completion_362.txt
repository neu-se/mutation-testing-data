  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.hasNext()` is a function call that checks if the iterator has more operations to process, while `otherIter.hasNext` is an object property that holds the result of the function call.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next()` fetches the next operation from the iterator, while `otherIter.hasNext` does not modify the iterator's state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.mayNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.mayNext()` is a hypothetical function that may fetch the next operation from the iterator, but does not modify the iterator's state.

DONE.
