  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc + data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator will concatenate the `acc` and `data` values, while the original code fragment used the `,` operator which would return an array with both values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc * data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator will multiply the `acc` and `data` values, while the original code fragment used the `,` operator which would return an array with both values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc.concat(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method will concatenate the `acc` and `data` arrays, while the original code fragment used the `,` operator which would return an array with both values.

DONE.
