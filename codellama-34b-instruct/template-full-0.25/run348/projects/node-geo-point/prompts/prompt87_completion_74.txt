  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
δ + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDestination` method would calculate the destination point using a different angular distance than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * δ
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDestination` method would calculate the destination point using twice the angular distance than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
δ / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDestination` method would calculate the destination point using half the angular distance than the original code.

DONE.
