  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[0-9]+
```
This would result in a different regex match because it matches any number of digits, whereas the original code fragment matches any number of non-slash characters followed by an optional slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
\w+
```
This would result in a different regex match because it matches any word character, whereas the original code fragment matches any non-slash character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[a-zA-Z]+
```
This would result in a different regex match because it matches any letter, whereas the original code fragment matches any non-slash character.

DONE.
