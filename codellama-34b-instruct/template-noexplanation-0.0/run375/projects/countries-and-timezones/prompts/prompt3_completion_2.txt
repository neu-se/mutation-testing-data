  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.timezones[id]
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the `id` variable instead of the `data` variable. This change may cause the `getTimezonesMap` function to return a different result, which could potentially cause the `buildCountry` function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.timezones[id] || {}
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the `id` variable instead of the `data` variable. This change may cause the `getTimezonesMap` function to return a different result, which could potentially cause the `buildCountry` function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.timezones[id] || { current: [], all: [] }
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the `id` variable instead of the `data` variable. This change
