  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would add an 'es' to words that end in 'x', 'ch', or 's', while this new code fragment would add an 's' to these words.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/i, function(w) { return w + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would add an 'es' to words that end in 'x', 'ch', or 's', while this new code fragment would add 'ies' to these words.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would add an 'es'
