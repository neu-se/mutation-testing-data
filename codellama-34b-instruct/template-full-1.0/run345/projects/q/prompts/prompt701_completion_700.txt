  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first two arguments to the function, which could break the function's intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, -2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last two arguments to the function, which could break the function's intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[0, 1, 2].map(array_slice(arguments, 1))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only take the first three arguments to the function, and would map them to the array `[0, 1, 2]`, which could break the function's intended behavior.

DONE.
