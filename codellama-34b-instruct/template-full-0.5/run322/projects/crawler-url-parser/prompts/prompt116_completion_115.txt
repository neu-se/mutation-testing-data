  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.delete(baseUrlStr);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` method would not be called on the `urlMap` object, which would cause the `for...of` loop to iterate over the entire map, including the base URL, which is not desirable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.delete(baseUrl);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` method would be called on the `baseUrl` object, which is not a map, and would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.delete(baseUrlStr.replace(/\//g, ''));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` would be modified to not include any forward slashes, which would cause the `delete` method to not find the correct key in the map, and would not delete the base URL from the map.

DONE.
