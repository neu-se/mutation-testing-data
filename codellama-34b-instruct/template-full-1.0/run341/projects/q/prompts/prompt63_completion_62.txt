  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
location
```
This would result in different behavior because `location` is a built-in object in JavaScript that provides information about the current location of the document, while `window` is the global object in a browser, which contains variables, objects, and functions that are aware of the current browsing context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
top
```
This would result in different behavior because `top` is a property of the `window` object that refers to the topmost browsing context in the current window, while `window` is the global object in a browser, which contains variables, objects, and functions that are aware of the current browsing context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self
```
This would result in different behavior because `self` is a property of the `window` object that refers to the current browsing context, while `window` is the global object in a browser, which contains variables, objects, and functions that are aware of the current browsing context
