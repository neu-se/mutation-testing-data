  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise", "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was passing a reference to the `definition` function, but the modified code fragment is passing the string "undefined" instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise", null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was passing a reference to the `definition` function, but the modified code fragment is passing the null value instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise", 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was passing a reference to the `definition` function, but the modified code fragment is passing the number 0 instead.

DONE.
