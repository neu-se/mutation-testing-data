  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).ninvoke
```
This would result in different behavior because `ninvoke` is a different method than `npost`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).nsend
```
This would result in different behavior because `nsend` is a different method than `npost`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("send", [name, nodeArgs])
```
This would result in different behavior because `dispatch` is a different method than `npost`, and the arguments passed to it are different.

DONE.
