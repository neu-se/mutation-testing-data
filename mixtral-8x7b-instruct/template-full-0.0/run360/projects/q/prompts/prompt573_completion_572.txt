 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.from(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the arguments object to a real array, which might not be the expected behavior in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[...arguments]
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the spread operator to create a new array from the arguments object, which could cause unintended side effects if the code relies on the original arguments object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.assign([], arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array with the same values as the arguments object using `Object.assign()`, which could also cause unintended side effects if the code relies on the original arguments object.

DONE.
