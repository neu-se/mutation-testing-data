  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] + this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the imaginary part of the complex number would be added instead of subtracted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] * this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the imaginary part of the complex number would be multiplied instead of subtracted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] - this['im'] - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the imaginary part of the complex number would be subtracted by 1 instead of just being subtracted.

DONE.
