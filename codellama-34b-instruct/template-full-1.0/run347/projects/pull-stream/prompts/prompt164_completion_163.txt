  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `onAbort` function only if `abort` is truthy, while the original code fragment would call it regardless.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort ? onAbort() : null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `onAbort` function if `abort` is truthy, but return `null` if it's falsy, while the original code fragment would always return `abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort ? abort : null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `onAbort` function only if `abort` is truthy, while the original code fragment would always call it regardless.

DONE.
