 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nfcall` function would no longer wait for the callback to be called. Instead, it would immediately return a resolved promise, causing the function to not work as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject("Error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nfcall` function would immediately reject the promise with an error message, instead of waiting for the callback to be called. This would cause any `then` methods chained after the `nfcall` to not be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
setTimeout(() => Q.resolve(), ms)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nfcall` function would wait for the specified number of milliseconds before resolving the promise, instead of waiting for the callback to be called. This would cause a delay in the execution of the function, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
