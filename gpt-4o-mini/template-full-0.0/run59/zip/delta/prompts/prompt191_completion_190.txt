Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(newOp.retain);
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to push the `retain` property of `newOp` instead of the entire `newOp` object, potentially leading to undefined behavior if `newOp.retain` is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push({ ...newOp, insert: null });
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies `newOp` by setting the `insert` property to `null`, which could change the intended operation from an insert to a no-op, affecting the final delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes `otherOp` instead of `newOp`, which could lead to incorrect composition of operations, as `otherOp` may not represent the intended operation derived from `thisOp` and `otherOp`.

DONE.
