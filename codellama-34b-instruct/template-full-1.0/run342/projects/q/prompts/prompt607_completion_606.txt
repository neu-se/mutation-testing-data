  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
op + 1
```

This would result in different behavior because `op + 1` would increment the value of `op` by 1, which would change the behavior of the code that uses the result of the `dispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
op * 2
```

This would result in different behavior because `op * 2` would double the value of `op`, which would change the behavior of the code that uses the result of the `dispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
op - 1
```

This would result in different behavior because `op - 1` would decrement the value of `op` by 1, which would change the behavior of the code that uses the result of the `dispatch` method.

DONE.
