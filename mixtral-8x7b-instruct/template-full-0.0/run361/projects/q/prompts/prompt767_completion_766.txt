 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { throw new Error('Buggy replacement'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because a thrown error would prevent the promise from being resolved or rejected properly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `when` function to treat the second argument as a handler function instead of a fulfillment handler, potentially leading to incorrect behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
promises[index]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the resolved value of the promise to be replaced with the promise itself, potentially leading to infinite recursion or other unexpected behavior.

DONE.
