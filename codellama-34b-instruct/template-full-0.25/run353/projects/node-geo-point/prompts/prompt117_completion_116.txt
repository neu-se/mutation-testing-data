  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a `GeoPoint` object, but `null` would cause a `TypeError` when trying to access its properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a `GeoPoint` object, but `undefined` would cause a `TypeError` when trying to access its properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new GeoPoint(0, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a `GeoPoint` object with non-zero coordinates, but `new GeoPoint(0, 0)` would cause the `calculateDestination` method to return a `GeoPoint` object with coordinates of (0, 0), which is different from the expected behavior.

DONE.
