  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `Q.race` is a function that returns a promise that is settled when the first of an array of promises is settled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` is a function that returns a resolved promise, whereas `Q.race` is a function that returns a promise that is settled when the first of an array of promises is settled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all` is a function that returns a promise that is settled when all of an array of promises are settled, whereas `Q.race` is a function that returns a promise that is settled when the first of an array of promises is settled.

DONE.
