  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the type of `options` is a string, while this new code checks if `options` is equal to the string `'string'`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `options` is a string, while this new code checks if `options` has a length of 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options[0] === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `options` is a string, while this new code checks if the first element of `options` is equal to the string `'string'`.

DONE.
