  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the arguments array to the `array_slice` function, which would return a new array containing all elements from the first argument (excluding the first element) to the end of the array. In the original code, the `arguments` object was not passed to any function, so the behavior would be different.

DONE.
