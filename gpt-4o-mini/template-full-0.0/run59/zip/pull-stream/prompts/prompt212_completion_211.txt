Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the `abortCb` function with `null` instead of the `aborted` error, which may lead to incorrect handling of the abort scenario, potentially causing the program to continue processing instead of stopping.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb('error')
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes a string 'error' to the `abortCb` function instead of the actual `aborted` error, which could mislead the error handling logic and result in unexpected behavior in the callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly passes the `data` variable to the `abortCb` function instead of the `aborted` error, which could cause the callback to process the data instead of handling the abort condition, leading to potential data corruption or logical errors.

DONE.
