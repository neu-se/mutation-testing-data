  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x, y
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, causing the calculation of the longitude to use the latitude value instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + y
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition operator would cause the calculation of the longitude to use the sum of the latitude and longitude values instead of the product.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * y
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operator would cause the calculation of the longitude to use the product of the latitude and longitude values instead of the sum.

DONE.
