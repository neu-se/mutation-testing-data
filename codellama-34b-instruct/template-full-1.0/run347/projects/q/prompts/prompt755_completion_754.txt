  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deprecate.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `deprecate.resolve()` would resolve the promise prematurely, while the original code waits for all promises to be settled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promises.reject()` would reject the promise prematurely, while the original code waits for all promises to be settled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(promises.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve(promises.length)` would resolve the promise with a different value than the original code, which resolves the promise with an array of settled promises.

DONE.
