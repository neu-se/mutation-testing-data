  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would not be called with a function as its second argument, and therefore the `onProgress` function would not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would not be called with a function as its second argument, and therefore the `onProgress` function would not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onProgress` function would be called with an empty function as its argument, and therefore the `deferred.notify` method would not be called.

DONE.
