  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.dispatch` method expects a valid object as its first argument, and passing `null` would cause the method to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.dispatch` method expects a valid object as its first argument, and passing `undefined` would cause the method to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.dispatch` method expects a valid object as its first argument, and passing an empty object would cause the method to throw an error.

DONE.
