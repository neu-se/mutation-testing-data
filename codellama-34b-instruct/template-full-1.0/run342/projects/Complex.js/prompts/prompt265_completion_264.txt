  Option 1: The `a` in the `log` method can be replaced with `b`, which would result in different behavior because `a` and `b` are swapped, and the method would calculate the natural logarithm of the imaginary part instead of the real part.

Option 2: The `a` in the `log` method can be replaced with `a+b`, which would result in different behavior because the method would calculate the natural logarithm of the sum of the real and imaginary parts instead of the real part alone.

Option 3: The `a` in the `log` method can be replaced with `Math.sqrt(a)`, which would result in different behavior because the method would calculate the square root of the real part instead of the natural logarithm.

DONE.
