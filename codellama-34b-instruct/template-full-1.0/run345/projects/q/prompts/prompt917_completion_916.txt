  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs[0].push
```
This would result in different behavior because `nodeArgs[0].push` is a different method than `nodeArgs.push`, and it would cause an error if `nodeArgs[0]` is not an array object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `nodeArgs.concat` is a different method than `nodeArgs.push`, and it would merge the `nodeArgs` object with the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` method, resulting in an unexpected output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `nodeArgs.slice` is a different method than `nodeArgs.push`, and it would return a copy of the `nodeArgs` array starting from the specified index, which would cause an error if the index is not specified.

DONE.
