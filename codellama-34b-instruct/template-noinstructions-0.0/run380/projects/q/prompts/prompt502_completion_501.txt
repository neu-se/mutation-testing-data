  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` variable is used to apply the `value` function, but `null` would cause the function to be called with no arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` variable is used to apply the `value` function, but `undefined` would cause the function to be called with no arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` variable is used to apply the `value` function, but an empty array would cause the function to be called with no arguments.

DONE.
