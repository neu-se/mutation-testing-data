 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve()` immediately returns a resolved promise, while the original code uses the `Q` function which might have different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject(new Error('Timeout'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it immediately rejects the promise with a timeout error, while the original code waits for the specified timeout before rejecting the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.then(function(value) { throw value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it throws the resolved value instead of simply returning it, which might cause the promise to be rejected if the calling code is not expecting a thrown value.

DONE.
