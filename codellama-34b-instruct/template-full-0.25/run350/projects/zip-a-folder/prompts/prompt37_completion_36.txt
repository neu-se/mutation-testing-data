  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isGlob(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `isGlob` function, so if the `src` variable is a glob, the function will return `false`, and if it's not a glob, the function will return `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(src) && src.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator requires both operands to be truthy, so if the `src` variable is a glob and its length is greater than 0, the function will return `true`, otherwise it will return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(src) || src.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator requires only one operand to be truthy, so if the `src` variable is a glob or its length is
