 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` array would always be replaced with an empty array, even when there are no additional arguments provided to `fbound`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.keys(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the arguments to an array of keys instead of concatenating the original `args` array with the new arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a shallow copy of the current `this` object instead of concatenating the `args` array with the new arguments.

DONE.
