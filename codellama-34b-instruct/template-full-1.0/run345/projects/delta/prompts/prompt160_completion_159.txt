  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushes the value returned by `otherIter.next()` onto the delta object, while this modified code would push `undefined` because `otherIter.next()` is not assigned to a variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherIter.next());
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushes the value returned by `otherIter.next()` onto the delta object, while this modified code would push the value returned by `otherIter.next()` twice, because it is called twice.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(thisIter.next());
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushes the value returned by `otherIter.next()` onto the delta object, while this modified code would push the value returned by `thisIter.next()`, which is a different value, onto the delta object.

DONE.
