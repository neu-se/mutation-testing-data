  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\/\//) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the path contains consecutive slashes, while the new code fragment checks if the path does not contain consecutive slashes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/[*+][^/]|[^/][*+]/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the path contains malformed wildcards, while the new code fragment checks if the path does not contain malformed wildcards.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/[^/]:|:\/|:$/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the path contains malformed captures, while the new code fragment checks if the path does not contain malformed captures.

DONE.
