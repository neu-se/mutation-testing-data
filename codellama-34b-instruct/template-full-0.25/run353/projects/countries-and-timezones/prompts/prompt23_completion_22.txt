  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(utcOffset + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `utcOffset` parameter is incremented by 1, which would cause the `getOffsetStr` function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(utcOffset * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `utcOffset` parameter is multiplied by 2, which would cause the `getOffsetStr` function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(utcOffset - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `utcOffset` parameter is decremented by 1, which would cause the `getOffsetStr` function to return a different value.

DONE.
