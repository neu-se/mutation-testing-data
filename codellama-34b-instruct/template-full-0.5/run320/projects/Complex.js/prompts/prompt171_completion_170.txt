  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isZero']() || z['isInfinite']()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `this` is zero or `z` is infinite, while the new code checks if `this` is zero or `z` is infinite and returns `Complex['ZERO']` in that case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isZero']() && z['isInfinite']()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `this` is zero or `z` is infinite, while the new code checks if `this` is zero and `z` is infinite and returns `Complex['ZERO']` in that case.
