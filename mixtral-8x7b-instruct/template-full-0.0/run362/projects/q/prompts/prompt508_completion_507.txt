 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
value.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` changes the value of `this` in the function being called, while `apply` uses an array of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
value.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a pre-defined `this` value and arguments, while `apply` invokes the function immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].concat.slice.call
```
This would result in different behavior because it is a more complex way of creating an array from arguments, while `apply` directly applies an array of arguments to a function.

DONE.
