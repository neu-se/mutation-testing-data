Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it increments `i` by 2 instead of 1, causing the loop to skip every other element in the array, potentially leading to incorrect results when searching for the value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because it decrements `i` instead of incrementing it, which would create an infinite loop or cause an out-of-bounds error, as `i` would never reach the length of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets `i` to the length of the array, causing the loop to not execute at all since the condition `i < this.length` would be false from the start.

DONE.
