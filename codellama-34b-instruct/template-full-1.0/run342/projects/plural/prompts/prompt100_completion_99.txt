  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'ae'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would replace any 'e' in the input word with 'ae', resulting in incorrect pluralization.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'e' + 'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would add 'a' to the end of the input word, resulting in incorrect pluralization.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'i'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would replace any 'e' in the input word with 'i', resulting in incorrect pluralization.

DONE.
