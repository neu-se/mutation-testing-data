 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function might expect the `data` argument, but instead receives a boolean `true`. This could cause the test to fail or pass unexpectedly, depending on how `test` is implemented.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` might not be bound to the correct context, and `test` might not be a function in that context. This could cause a `TypeError` or other unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop(test)(data)
