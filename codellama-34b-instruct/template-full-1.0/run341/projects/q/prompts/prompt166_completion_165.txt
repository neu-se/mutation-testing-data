  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `++i` statement increments the value of `i` and returns the new value, whereas `i + 1` simply returns the result of the addition, without modifying the original value of `i`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+= 1`statement increments the value of `i` and returns the new value, whereas `++i` simply returns the original value of `i` after incrementing it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(i++ + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `++i` statement increments the value of `i` and returns the new value, whereas `(i++ + 1)` first increments the value of `i` and then returns the result of the addition
