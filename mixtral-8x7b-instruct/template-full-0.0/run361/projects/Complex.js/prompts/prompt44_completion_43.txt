 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `else if` condition would always be true, causing the 're' and 'im' properties of the 'z' object to be set directly from the 'a' and 'b' arguments, regardless of their type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'b' argument would only be assigned to 'z["im"]' if it is equal to null, whereas the original condition checks if 'b' is not equal to undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'im' in a
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'z["im"]' property would be set to 0 if the 'im' property exists in the 'a' object, rather than checking if 'b' is not equal to undefined.

DONE.
