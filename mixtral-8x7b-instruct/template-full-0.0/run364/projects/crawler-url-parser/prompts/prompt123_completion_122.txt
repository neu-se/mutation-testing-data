 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[...urlMap.values()]
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array from the values of the Map, whereas the original code uses an iterator. This change would affect the behavior of the `retArr.map` function that follows, as it expects an iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
urlMap.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns an iterator over the keys of the Map, not the values. This change would cause the `retArr.map` function that follows to fail, as it expects an iterator over the values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.values(urlMap)
