 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/^\.*\//.test
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks for starting with zero or more "." followed by a "/", ignoring the localhost check.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/^[a-zA-Z]+:/.test
