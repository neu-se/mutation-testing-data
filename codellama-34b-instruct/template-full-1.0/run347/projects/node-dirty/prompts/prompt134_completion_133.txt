  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, so the `delete` method would simply return `false` without actually deleting the key from the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid key in a map, so the `delete` method would throw a `TypeError` exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object, so the `delete` method would delete the  property from the object, but not the corresponding key from the map.
DONE.
