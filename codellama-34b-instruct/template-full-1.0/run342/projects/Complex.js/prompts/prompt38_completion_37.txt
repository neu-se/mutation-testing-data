  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a < 4000 && _b < 5000
```
This would result in different behavior because the check for small values is weaker, allowing larger values to pass through.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a < _b - 1000 && _b < 2000
```
This would result in different behavior because the check for small values is strengthened, allowing only smaller values to pass through.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Math.sqrt(_a * _a + _b * _b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the check for small values is entirely different, using a square root instead of a multiplication and comparison.

DONE.
