 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps the `deferred.reject` call in an arrow function, which could change the context in which `reject` is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the `resolve` method instead of the `reject` method, causing the promise to be fulfilled instead of rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes a `null` value as the first argument to the `reject` method, which could cause the error handling code to behave differently.

DONE.
