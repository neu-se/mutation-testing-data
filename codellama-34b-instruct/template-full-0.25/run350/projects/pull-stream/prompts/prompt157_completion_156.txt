  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `cb` function with a single argument, `null`, while this replacement calls it with two arguments, `false` and `_value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_value = null
cb(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets the `value` variable to `null` and then calls the `cb` function with a single argument, `null`, while this replacement sets the `value` variable to `null` and then calls the `cb` function with two arguments, `true` and `_value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, _value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `cb` function with a single argument, `null`, while this replacement calls it with two arguments, `null` and `_value`.

DONE.
