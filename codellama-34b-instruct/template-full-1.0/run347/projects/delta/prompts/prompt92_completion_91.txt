  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for equality, but this code fragment checks for inequality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index === other.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for equality with the length of the `this.ops` array, but this code fragment checks for equality with the length of the `other.ops` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index % 2 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for equality with a constant, but this code fragment checks for equality with the result of a modulo operation.

DONE.
