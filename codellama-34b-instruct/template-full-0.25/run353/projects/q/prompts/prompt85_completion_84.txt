  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick(flush);
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` is a function that takes no arguments, but `flush` is a function that takes one argument. Calling `requestTick` with `flush` as an argument would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick(function() {});
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` is a function that takes no arguments, but `function() {}` is a function that takes no arguments and returns `undefined`. Calling `requestTick` with `function() {}` as an argument would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` is a function that takes no arguments, but `null` is a value that is not a function. Calling `requestTick` with `null` as an argument would cause an error.
