  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method is not defined on the `Promise.prototype` object, so it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.prototype.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method is not defined on the `Promise.prototype` object, so it would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method is not defined on the `Q` object, so it would throw an error.

DONE.
