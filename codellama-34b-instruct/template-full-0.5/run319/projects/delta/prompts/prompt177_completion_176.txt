  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekLength()` would return a different value than `otherIter.peekLength()`, which would impact the calculation of `opLength` and potentially lead to a different outcome in the `diff()` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `length` and `otherIter.peekLength()` are being subtracted in a different order than in the original code, which could affect the calculation of `opLength` and potentially lead to a different outcome in the `diff()` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `length - otherIter.peekLength()` is being added to `1` instead of `0`, which could affect the calculation of `opLength` and potentially
