  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is not called on the `deferred` object, which would cause the promise to never be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).fail(deferred.resolve);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is called on the `deferred` object with a different argument, which would cause the promise to be resolved instead of rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).fail(function() {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is called on the `deferred` object with a different argument, which would cause the promise to be resolved with a different value.

DONE.
