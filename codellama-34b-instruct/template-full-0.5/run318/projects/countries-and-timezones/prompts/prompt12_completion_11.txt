  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] = { current: [], all: [] }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would overwrite the existing `result[country]` object with a new object, losing any existing data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].current = []
```
This would result in different behavior because it would overwrite the existing `result[country].current` array with an empty array, losing any existing data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].all = []
```
This would result in different behavior because it would overwrite the existing `result[country].all` array with an empty array, losing any existing data.

DONE.
