Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an iterable of the keys in the `urlMap` instead of the values, leading to a situation where the subsequent code would not have access to the actual URL objects stored in the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.from(urlMap.entries())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of key-value pairs (as arrays) from the `urlMap`, rather than just the values, which would change how the subsequent code processes the data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.values().filter(url => url.type === 'internal')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would filter the values to only include those with a type of 'internal', potentially omitting other URLs that do not meet this condition, thus altering the final output.

DONE.
