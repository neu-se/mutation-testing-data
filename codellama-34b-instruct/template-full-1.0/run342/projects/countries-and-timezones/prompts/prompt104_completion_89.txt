  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [key]: tzs[key].toString() }
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys()` returns an array of strings, so the original code fragment `{ [key]: tzs[key] }` would try to access a property on the `tzs` object using a string key, which would return `undefined` if the property does not exist. However, using `toString()` would convert the key to a string even if it is not a string originally, which could result in different behavior if the key is not a valid property on the `tzs` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [key]: Array.isArray(tzs[key]) ? tzs[key][0] : tzs[key] }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `{ [key]: tzs[key] }` would try to access a property on the `tzs` object using a key, which would return `undefined` if the property does not exist. However, using `Array
