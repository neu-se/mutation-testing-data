  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(linkurl instanceof URL)
```
This would result in different behavior because `instanceof` is a JavaScript operator that checks whether an object is an instance of a specific class. In this case, if `linkurl` is not an instance of `URL`, the conditional statement will evaluate to `true`, and the new code fragment will result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl === "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because if `linkurl` is the string "foo", the conditional statement will evaluate to `true`, and the new code fragment will result in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.search("foo") !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because if the `search` function returns a non-negative number, the conditional statement will evaluate to `true`, and the new code fragment will result in different behavior.

DONE.
