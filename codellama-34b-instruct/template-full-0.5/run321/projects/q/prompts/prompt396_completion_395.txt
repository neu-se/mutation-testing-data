  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return null; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return null, regardless of the value passed to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return undefined; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return undefined, regardless of the value passed to it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return this; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return the global object (or undefined in strict mode), regardless of the value passed to it.

DONE.
