Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(b)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it retrieves the first value of the object `b` instead of the first key, which could lead to mismatches in the expected embed types.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType === Object.keys(b)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the comparison from checking if the embed types are matched to checking if they are equal, which could lead to false positives if the types are not strictly equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(b).length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `b` has any keys instead of comparing the first key of `b` with `embedType`, potentially allowing for cases where `b` is an empty object to pass without throwing an error.

DONE.
