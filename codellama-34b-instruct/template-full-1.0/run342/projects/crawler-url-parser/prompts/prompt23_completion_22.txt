  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/,'https://');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the presence of a protocol at the beginning of the URL, while this modified code fragment forces a protocol to be added if it is missing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/,'http://www.');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the presence of a protocol at the beginning of the URL, while this modified code fragment adds a www subdomain if it is missing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/:\/\//,'://www.');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the presence of a protocol at the beginning of the URL, while this modified code fragment adds a www subdomain to any existing protocol.
