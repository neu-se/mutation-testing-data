  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because `adjustPrecision` would be called with the same value as `this.longitude`, which would not adjust the precision as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `adjustPrecision` would be called with a different value than `this.longitude`, which would adjust the precision and return a different `GeoPoint` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude !== 0 ? this.longitude : this.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because `adjustPrecision` would check whether `this.longitude` is not equal to 0 before adjusting the precision, which would result in a different `GeoPoint` object if `this.longitude` is equal to 0.

DONE.
