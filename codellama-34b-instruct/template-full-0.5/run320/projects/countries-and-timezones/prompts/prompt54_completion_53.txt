  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones.filter(t => t.deprecated)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the deprecated timezones, while the original code fragment returns all timezones.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones.map(t => t.name)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of timezone names, while the original code fragment returns an array of timezone objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones.reduce((acc, t) => acc + t.offset, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the sum of all timezone offsets, while the original code fragment returns an array of timezone objects.

DONE.
