  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` function is not defined in the provided code snippet, and it is not clear what it does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(deferred.promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` function is not defined in the provided code snippet, and it is not clear what it does. Additionally, passing `deferred.promise` as an argument to `makeNodeResolver` may cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(deferred.promise, deferred.reject)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` function is not defined in the provided code snippet, and it is not clear what it does. Additionally, passing `deferred.promise` and `deferred.reject` as arguments
