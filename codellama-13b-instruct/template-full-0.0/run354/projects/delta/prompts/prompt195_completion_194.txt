  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNotEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNotEqual` function would be used instead of `isEqual`, which would cause the `diff` function to return a delta with the opposite operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isEqual` function would be used instead of `isNotEqual`, which would cause the `diff` function to return a delta with the same operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isEqual(thisOp.insert, otherOp.insert)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isEqual` function would be used instead of `isNotEqual`, which would cause the `diff` function to return a delta with the same operations.

DONE.
