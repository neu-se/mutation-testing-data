  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("PLACEHOLDER")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new error object with the message "PLACEHOLDER", whereas the original code fragment simply returns the `exception` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `null` instead of an error object, which could cause the promise to be resolved instead of rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `undefined` instead of an error object, which could cause the promise to be resolved instead of rejected.

DONE.
