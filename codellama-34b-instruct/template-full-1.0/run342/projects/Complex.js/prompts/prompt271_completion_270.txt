  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan(b/a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compute the inverse tangent of `b/a`, which is a different function from `Math.atan2(b, a)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atanh(b/a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compute the inverse hyperbolic tangent of `b/a`, which is a different function from `Math.atan2(b, a)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * Math.atan(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compute the product of `b` and the arc tangent of `a`, which is a different operation from `Math.atan2(b, a)`.

DONE.
