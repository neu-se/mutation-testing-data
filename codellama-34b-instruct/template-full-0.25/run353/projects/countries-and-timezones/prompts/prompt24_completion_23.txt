  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
utcOffset + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the offset would be increased by 1, which could cause the resulting time to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
utcOffset * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the offset would be doubled, which could cause the resulting time to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
utcOffset / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the offset would be halved, which could cause the resulting time to be incorrect.

DONE.
