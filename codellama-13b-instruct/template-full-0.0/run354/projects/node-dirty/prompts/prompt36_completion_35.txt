  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, val] = rowStr.split(':');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the row string on the colon character instead of the comma character. This would cause the key and value to be parsed incorrectly, which could lead to errors in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, val] = rowStr.split(',');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the row string on the comma character instead of the colon character. This would cause the key and value to be parsed correctly, but it would also cause the program to ignore the colon character in the row string, which could lead to errors in the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, val] = rowStr.split(' ');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the row string on the space character instead of the comma or colon character. This would cause the key and value to be parsed incorrectly
