  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because this code fragment would always return the input string without the last character, instead of removing one character from the end of the input string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1, w.length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because this code fragment would return the input string without the last two characters, instead of removing one character from the end of the input string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1, w.length
```
This would result in different behavior because this code fragment would return the input string without the first character, instead of removing one character from the end of the input string.

DONE.
