  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimRight().startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `trimRight()` removes characters from the end of the string, while `trimLeft()` removes characters from the beginning of the string. This means that the resulting URL may be different, and the request may fail if the URL is not properly formatted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.slice(1).startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(1)` removes the first character of the string, which may change the meaning of the URL. For example, if the URL is "https://example.com", `slice(1)` would return "https://example.com/", which is a different URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.replace('https', 'http')
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the "https" protocol with "http", which may cause the request to fail if the server does not support HTTP.
