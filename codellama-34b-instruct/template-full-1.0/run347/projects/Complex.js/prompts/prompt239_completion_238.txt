  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` returns `NaN` when its argument is not a positive number, while `NaN` would cause the code to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` returns the positive square root of a number, while `Math.log` returns the natural logarithm of a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` takes a number as its argument, while `Math.PI` is a constant representing the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter.

DONE.
