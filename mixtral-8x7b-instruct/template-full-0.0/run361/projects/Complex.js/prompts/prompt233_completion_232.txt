 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (r + a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the sign of the second term in the denominator, potentially leading to incorrect results in the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(2) * (r - a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a constant factor, which would affect the final result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(r - a) * (r - a)
