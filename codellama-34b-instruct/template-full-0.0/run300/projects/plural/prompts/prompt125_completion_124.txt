  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:tea|sugar|water|air|rice|knowledge|beauty|anger|fear|love|money|research|safety|evidence)\b/i, function(w) { return w.toUpperCase() }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the word to uppercase, which is not the intended behavior of the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:tea|sugar|water|air|rice|knowledge|beauty|anger|fear|love|money|research|safety|evidence)\b/i, function(w) { return w.substr(1) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr()` method would return a substring of the word, starting from the second character, which is not the intended behavior of the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACE
