  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always retrieve the first country from the data, regardless of the ID passed in.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always retrieve the previous country from the data, regardless of the ID passed in.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always retrieve the next country from the data, regardless of the ID passed in.

DONE.
