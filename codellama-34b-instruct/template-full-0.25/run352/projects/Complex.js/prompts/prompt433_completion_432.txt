  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the result to be off by one unit, which could cause the test to fail if it is checking for exact equality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the result to be off by one unit in the opposite direction, which could also cause the test to fail if it is checking for exact equality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the result to be twice as large, which could cause the test to fail if it is checking for exact equality or if it is expecting a specific range of values.

DONE.
