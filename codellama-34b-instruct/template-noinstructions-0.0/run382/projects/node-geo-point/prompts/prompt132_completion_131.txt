  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile` method would receive a `null` value as the `coordinate` parameter, which would cause it to throw a `TypeError` when trying to access the `longitude` and `latitude` properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile` method would receive an empty object as the `coordinate` parameter, which would cause it to throw a `TypeError` when trying to access the `longitude` and `latitude` properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ longitude: 0, latitude: 0 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile` method would receive an object with `longitude` and `latitude` properties set to `0`, which would cause it to return a tile with a different position than the original code.

DONE.
