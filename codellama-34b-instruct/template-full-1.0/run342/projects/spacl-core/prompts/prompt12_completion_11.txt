  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because `spec.split('/')` would return an array of strings split by '/', while `spec.match` would return a `RegExpMatchArray` object containing information about the match.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.replace('/', 'abc')
```
This would result in different behavior because `spec.replace('/', 'abc')` would replace all occurrences of '/' in `spec` with 'abc', while `spec.match` would return a `RegExpMatchArray` object containing information about the match.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `spec.slice(1)` would return the substring of `spec` starting from index 1, while `spec.match` would return an array of strings that match the regex pattern.

DONE.
