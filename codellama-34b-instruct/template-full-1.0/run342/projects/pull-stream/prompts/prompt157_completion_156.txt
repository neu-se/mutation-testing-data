  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb
```
This would result in different behavior because `!cb` would invert the boolean value of `cb`, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to a different branch.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb || false
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb || false` would always evaluate to `true`, potentially causing the `if` statement to always execute the first branch.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false`, potentially causing the `else` branch to execute.

DONE.
