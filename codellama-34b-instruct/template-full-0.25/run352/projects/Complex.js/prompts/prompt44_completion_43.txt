  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `a` is not equal to `b`, rather than checking if `b` is not equal to `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `b` is equal to `undefined`, rather than checking if `a` is not equal to `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `a` is equal to `b`, rather than checking if `b` is not equal to `undefined`.

DONE.
