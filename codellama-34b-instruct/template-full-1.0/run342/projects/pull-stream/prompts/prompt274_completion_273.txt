  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
never()
```
This would result in different behavior because `never()` returns a stream that never produces any data, whereas `once()` returns a stream that produces the value it wraps only once.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because `[]` is an empty array, whereas `once()` returns a stream that produces the value it wraps only once.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read()
```
This would result in different behavior because `_read()` is a function that reads from the stream, whereas `once()` returns a stream that produces the value it wraps only once.

DONE.
