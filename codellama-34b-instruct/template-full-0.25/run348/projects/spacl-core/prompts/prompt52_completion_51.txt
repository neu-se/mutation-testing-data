  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push(part.slice(1))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the entire part string onto the parts array, rather than just the part string without the leading colon.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push(part.replace(/([^/]+)/g, '\\$1'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push a modified version of the part string onto the parts array, rather than the original part string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push(part.replace(/([^/]+)/g, '\\$1').slice(1))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push a modified version of the part string onto the parts array, and then slice off the first character of the modified string.

DONE.
