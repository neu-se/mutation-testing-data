  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] / abs;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would divide the imaginary part of the complex number by the absolute value of the complex number, which would not be the same as the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] / abs;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would divide the real part of the complex number by the absolute value of the complex number, which would not be the same as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] / this['re'];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would divide the imaginary part of the complex number by the real part of the complex number, which would not be the same as the original code.

DONE.
