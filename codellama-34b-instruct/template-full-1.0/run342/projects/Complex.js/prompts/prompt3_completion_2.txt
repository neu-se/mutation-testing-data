  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan` is a unary function that returns the arctangent of its argument, while `Math.exp` is a binary function that returns the exponential of its arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` is a unary function that returns the sine of its argument, while `Math.exp` is a binary function that returns the exponential of its arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` is a unary function that returns the cosine of its argument, while `Math.exp` is a binary function that returns the exponential of its arguments.

DONE.
