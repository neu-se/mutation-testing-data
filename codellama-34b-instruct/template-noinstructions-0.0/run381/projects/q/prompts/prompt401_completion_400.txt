  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(function () { throw reason; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error instead of returning a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(function () { return reason; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the rejection reason instead of returning a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(function () { return Q.reject(reason); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a rejected promise with the rejection reason instead of throwing an error.

DONE.
