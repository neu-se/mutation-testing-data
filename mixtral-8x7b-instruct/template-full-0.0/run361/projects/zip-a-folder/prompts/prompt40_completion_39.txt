 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
src.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it splits the `src` string into individual characters instead of path segments, which can cause issues when processing the paths later in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
src.split(globPart)
