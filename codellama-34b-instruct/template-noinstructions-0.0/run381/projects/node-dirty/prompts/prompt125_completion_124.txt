  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('write_close');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits the 'write_close' event on the `this._writeStream` object, while the replaced code emits it on the `Dirty` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('write_close'));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits the 'write_close' event, while the replaced code emits an 'error' event with a new Error object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('write_close', this._writeStream);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits the 'write_close' event without any arguments, while the replaced code emits it with the `this._writeStream` object as an argument.

DONE.
