  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"send", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method is not defined in the `Promise.prototype` object, but the `send` method is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"dispatch", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method is not defined in the `Promise.prototype` object, but the `post` method is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"makeNodeResolver", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is not defined in the `Promise.prototype` object, but the `post` method is.

DONE.
