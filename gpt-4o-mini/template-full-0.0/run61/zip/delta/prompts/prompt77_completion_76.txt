Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly treat non-object types as valid, potentially leading to unexpected behavior when trying to access properties on `lastOp`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow `null` or `undefined` values for `lastOp`, which would bypass the intended checks and could lead to runtime errors when attempting to access properties on `lastOp`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(lastOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only allow `lastOp` to be valid if it is an array, rejecting all other object types, which could disrupt the intended functionality of handling various operation types.

DONE.
