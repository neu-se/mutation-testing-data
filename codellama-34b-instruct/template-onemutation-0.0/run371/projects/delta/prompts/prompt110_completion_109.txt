  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.insert` is a string, while `op` is an object with an `insert` property. In the original code, `op` is being used as an object, but with this change, `op.insert` would be used as a string, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
