  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!isEqual` function checks for deep equality, while the `!==` operator only checks for reference equality. This means that the `!==` operator may return `true` even if the two objects have the same properties and values, but are not the same object reference.

DONE.
