  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the key would be incremented by 1, which could cause the code to access the wrong data or fail to find the correct data in the database.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the key would be decremented by 1, which could cause the code to access the wrong data or fail to find the correct data in the database.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the key would be converted to uppercase, which could cause the code to access the wrong data or fail to find the correct data in the database if the keys are case-sensitive.

DONE.
