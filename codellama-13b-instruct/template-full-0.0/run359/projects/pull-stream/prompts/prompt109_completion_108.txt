  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reducer(acc, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reducer` function is called with the `acc` and `data` arguments in the opposite order than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc + data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator is used to concatenate the `acc` and `data` values, rather than calling the `reducer` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc.concat(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method is used to concatenate the `acc` and `data` values, rather than calling the `reducer` function.

DONE.
