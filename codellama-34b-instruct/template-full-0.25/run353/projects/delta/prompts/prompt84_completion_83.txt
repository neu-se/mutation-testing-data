  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes === lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if the `attributes` property of `newOp` and `lastOp` are the same object, rather than checking if they have the same keys and values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes !== lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if the `attributes` property of `newOp` and `lastOp` are not the same object, rather than checking if they have different keys or values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(newOp.attributes).length !== Object.keys(lastOp.attributes).length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if the number of keys in the `attributes` property of `newOp` and `lastOp` are the same, rather than checking if the keys and values are the same.

DONE.
