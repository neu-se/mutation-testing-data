  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted = true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `aborted` variable would be set to `true`, causing the `if (aborted)` check to pass and the `cb(aborted)` function to be called. This would result in the `asyncMap` function returning an error to the caller.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted = false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `aborted` variable would be set to `false`, causing the `if (aborted)` check to fail and the `cb(aborted)` function to not be called. This would result in the `asyncMap` function returning the mapped data to the caller.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `aborted` variable would be set to `null`, causing the `if (aborted)` check to fail and the `cb(aborted)` function to not be called. This
