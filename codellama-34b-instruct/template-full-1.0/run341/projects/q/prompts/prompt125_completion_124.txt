  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty.call(this, key)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` function would bind the `object_hasOwnProperty` function to the `key` object, causing it to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!object_hasOwnProperty(this, key)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the result of the `object_hasOwnProperty` function, causing it to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty(this, key)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_hasOwnProperty` function would not be called, causing an error.

DONE.
