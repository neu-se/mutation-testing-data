  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '/').replace(/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '/');
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/\/(index|default)\.[a-z]+$/` matches both "index" and "default" at the end of the URL path, and the `replace` method replaces both matches with a single "/". In the original code, the `replace` method is only called once, and it replaces the "index" match with a "/".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '/').replace(/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '/').replace(/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '/');
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/\/(index|default)\.[a-z]+$/` matches both "index" and "default" at the end
