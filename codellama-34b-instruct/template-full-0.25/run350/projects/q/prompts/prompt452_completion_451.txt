  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason.message
```
This would result in different behavior because `reason.stack` returns the stack trace of the error, while `reason.message` returns the error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason.name
```
This would result in different behavior because `reason.stack` returns the stack trace of the error, while `reason.name` returns the name of the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason.code
```
This would result in different behavior because `reason.stack` returns the stack trace of the error, while `reason.code` returns the error code.

DONE.
