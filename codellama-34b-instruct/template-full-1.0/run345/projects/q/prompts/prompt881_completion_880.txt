  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` should be used instead of `deferred.resolve` to reject the promise with an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject("Error message");
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise should be rejected with the error object instead of a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Error message"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `new Error` constructor should be used to create a new Error object with the error message.

DONE.
