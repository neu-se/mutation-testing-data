  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === 0
```
This change will cause the `length` function to return 0 instead of the expected value, which will make the test fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === 'string'
```
This change will cause the `length` function to return 1 instead of the expected value, which will make the test fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === null
```
This change will cause the `length` function to return 0 instead of the expected value, which will make the test fail.

DONE.
