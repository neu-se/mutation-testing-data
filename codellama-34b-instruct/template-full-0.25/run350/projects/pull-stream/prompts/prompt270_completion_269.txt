  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream && 'function' === typeof stream
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `stream` is a function, rather than an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream && 'object' !== typeof stream
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `stream` is not an object, rather than an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream && 'function' === typeof stream.read
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `stream.read` is a function, rather than checking if `stream` is an object.

DONE.
