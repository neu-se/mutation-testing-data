Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '-1'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for a string that does not represent a valid operator, leading to incorrect parsing of the input string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '*'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the multiplication operator instead of the addition operator, which would cause the parser to incorrectly interpret the input and potentially lead to incorrect complex number construction.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c !== '+'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for any character that is not a plus sign, which would incorrectly count all characters as valid operators, leading to erroneous parsing logic.

DONE.
