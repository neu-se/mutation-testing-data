  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `array` variable directly, while the new code fragment uses the `array.length` property, which is the length of the array. This could cause the function to return a different value, depending on the length of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `array` variable directly, while the new code fragment uses the `array[0]` element, which is the first element of the array. This could cause the function to return a different value, depending on the contents of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `array` variable directly, while the new code fragment uses the `array.slice(1)` method, which returns a new array containing all elements of the original array except
