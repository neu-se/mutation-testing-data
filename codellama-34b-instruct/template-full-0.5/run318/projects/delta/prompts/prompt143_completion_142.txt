  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `while` loop to iterate one less time than it should, potentially missing a necessary operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `while` loop to iterate one more time than it should, potentially leading to an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `while` loop to iterate twice as many times as it should, potentially leading to an infinite loop.

DONE.
