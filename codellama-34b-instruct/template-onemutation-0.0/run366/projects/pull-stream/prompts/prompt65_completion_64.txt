  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(null, end)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `done` callback with `null` as the first argument, which is not the expected behavior. The original code fragment calls the `done` callback with `end` as the first argument, which is the expected behavior.

DONE.
