  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!end` operator is a logical NOT, which returns `true` if the operand is falsy and `false` otherwise. In this case, `end` is a variable that is passed as an argument to the function, so it may be either `true` or `false`. If `end` is `true`, the `!end` operator will return `false`, which means that the `op` function will not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, which means that the operands must be of the same type and have the same value. In this case, `end` is a variable that is passed as an argument to the function, so it may be either `true` or `false`. If `end` is `true`, the `end === true` expression will return `true`, which means that the `op` function will be called.
