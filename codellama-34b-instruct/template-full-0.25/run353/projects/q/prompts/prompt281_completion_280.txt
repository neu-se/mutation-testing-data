  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was expecting an array of arguments, but by replacing it with null, it would cause the code to throw a TypeError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was expecting an array of arguments, but by replacing it with undefined, it would cause the code to throw a TypeError.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was expecting an array of arguments, but by replacing it with an empty array, it would cause the code to throw a TypeError.

DONE.
