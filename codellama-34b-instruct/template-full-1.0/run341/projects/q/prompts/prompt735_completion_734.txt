  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
any
```
This would result in different behavior because `any` is a different method from `all` that returns the first fulfilled promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
race
```
This would result in different behavior because `race` is a different method from `all` that returns the first fulfilled promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolved(promises)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolved` is a different method from `all` that returns a promise that is resolved as soon as all the input promises have resolved.

DONE.
