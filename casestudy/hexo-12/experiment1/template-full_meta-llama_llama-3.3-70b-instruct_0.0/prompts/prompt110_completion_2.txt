Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data.slug
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method is not called, which could lead to issues if `data.slug` is not already a string, potentially causing errors in the `slugize` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data.title
```
This would result in different behavior because `data.title` is used instead of `data.slug`, which could lead to incorrect slug generation if `data.title` is not the intended value for the slug.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data.slug + 'test'
```
This would result in different behavior because a fixed string 'test' is appended to `data.slug`, which could lead to incorrect slug generation and potentially cause issues with file naming or routing.

DONE.
