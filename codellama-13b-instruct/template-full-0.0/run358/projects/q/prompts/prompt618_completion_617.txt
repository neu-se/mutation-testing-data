  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a property accessor, while the new code fragment is a variable accessor. This could cause the code to behave differently in certain situations, such as when the variable `key` is not defined.
