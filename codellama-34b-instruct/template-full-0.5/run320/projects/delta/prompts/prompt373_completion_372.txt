  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the iterator to skip over the next two elements in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.prev()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `prev()` method is called instead of `next()`, which would cause the iterator to move backward through the array instead of forward.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(length + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method is called with an argument that is one more than the length of the array, which would cause the iterator to move past the end of the array.

DONE.
