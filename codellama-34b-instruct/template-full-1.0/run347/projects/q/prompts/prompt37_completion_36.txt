  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain && domain.exit()
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `domain.exit()` method is called only if `domain` is truthy. In this modified code, `domain.exit()` would be called unconditionally, which could result in unexpected behavior if `domain` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain || domain.exit()
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `domain.exit()` method is called only if `domain` is falsy. In this modified code, `domain.exit()` would be called only if `domain` is truthy, which could result in unexpected behavior if `domain` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain ? domain.exit() : null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `domain.exit()` method is not called if `domain` is falsy. In
