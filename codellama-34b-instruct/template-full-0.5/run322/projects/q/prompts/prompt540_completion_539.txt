  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved, which could cause the code to take a different path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be notified instead of resolved, which could cause the code to take a different path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled.all
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with all values instead of just the first value, which could cause the code to take a different path.

DONE.
