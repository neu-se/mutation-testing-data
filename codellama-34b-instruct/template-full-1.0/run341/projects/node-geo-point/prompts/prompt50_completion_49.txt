  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ + π
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing calculation would be off by 180 degrees, which would cause the destination point to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 - φ1
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing calculation would be off by the difference between the two latitudes, which would cause the destination point to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(λ2 - λ1) % 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing calculation would be off by the difference between the two longitudes, which would cause the destination point to be incorrect.

DONE.
