  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allResolved` function is used to wait for all promises to be settled, either fulfilled or rejected. If we replace it with `fulfilled`, the promise would be resolved only if all promises are fulfilled, and the function would not ignore rejected promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allResolved` function is used to wait for all promises to be settled, either fulfilled or rejected. If we replace it with `rejected`, the promise would be resolved only if all promises are rejected, and the function would not ignore fulfilled promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allResolved` function is used to wait for all promises to be settled, either fulfilled or rejected. If we replace it with `deferred.resolve`, the promise would be resolved immediately
