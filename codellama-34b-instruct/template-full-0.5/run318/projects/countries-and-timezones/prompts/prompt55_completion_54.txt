  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the `options` object is empty or not, while replacing it with `null` would cause the code to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the `options` object is empty or not, while replacing it with an empty object `{}` would cause the code to think that the `options` object is empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the `options` object is empty or not, while replacing it with a reference to the `deprecated` property of the `options` object would cause the code to check if the `deprecated` property is truthy or not.

DONE.
