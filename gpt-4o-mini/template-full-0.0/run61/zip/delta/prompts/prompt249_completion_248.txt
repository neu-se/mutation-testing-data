Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use a fixed length of 0 for the `thisIter.peekLength()` call, potentially causing the operation to skip over elements incorrectly, leading to unexpected results in the diff operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to use a length that is one greater than the actual length available, which could lead to out-of-bounds access or incorrect processing of the operations, resulting in a failure to accurately compute the differences.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reduce the length by one, potentially causing the diff operation to miss processing the last element of the current operation, leading to incomplete or incorrect diffs being generated.

DONE.
