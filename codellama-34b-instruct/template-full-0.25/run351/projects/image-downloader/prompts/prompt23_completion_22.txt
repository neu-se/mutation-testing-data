  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
__filename
```
This would result in different behavior because `__filename` returns the path of the current file, while `__dirname` returns the path of the current directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.cwd()
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.cwd()` returns the current working directory, while `__dirname` returns the path of the current directory.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname(options.dest)` returns the parent directory of the `options.dest` path, while `__dirname` returns the path of the current directory.

DONE.
