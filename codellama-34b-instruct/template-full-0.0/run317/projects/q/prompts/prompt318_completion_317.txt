  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype` is a different object than `Promise.prototype`, and the code that uses the `Promise.prototype` may not work correctly if it is replaced with `Object.prototype`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an object, and the code that uses the `Promise.prototype` may not work correctly if it is replaced with `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not an object, and the code that uses the `Promise.prototype` may not work correctly if it is replaced with `undefined`.

DONE.
