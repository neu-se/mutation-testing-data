  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[nodeArgs, name]
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments would be passed in the opposite order, which could cause issues if the function being called expects them in a specific order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument would be passed to the function, which could cause issues if the function does not expect it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs.reverse()]
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments would be passed in reverse order, which could cause issues if the function being called expects them in a specific order.

DONE.
