  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(b, a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments are swapped, which changes the result of the `atan2` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(a, b) + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the result of the `atan2` function is offset by `Math.PI`, which changes the overall result of the expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(a, b) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the result of the `atan2` function is multiplied by 2, which changes the overall result of the expression.

DONE.
