 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` function would be called immediately, instead of being passed as a callback to the `dispatch` method. This would cause the promise to always be rejected, even if the `dispatch` method eventually resolves.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` function would be called immediately, instead of being passed as a callback to the `dispatch` method. This would cause the promise to always be resolved, even if the `dispatch` method eventually rejects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { deferred.reject(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because a new function would be created and passed as a callback to the `dispatch` method, instead of passing the `deferred.reject` function directly. This could potentially cause issues if the new function is
