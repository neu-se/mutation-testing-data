  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!tester
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the result of the `tester` function, which could cause the `filter` function to return a different value than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would bind the `tester` function to a different context, which could cause it to behave differently than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `tester` function with a different context, which could cause it to behave differently than expected.

DONE.
