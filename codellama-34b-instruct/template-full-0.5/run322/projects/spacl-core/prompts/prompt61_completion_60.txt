  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
min = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code sets `min` to 0, but this change sets it to 1, which would cause the regex to match a different set of strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max = 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code sets `max` to 0, but this change sets it to 2, which would cause the regex to match a different set of strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
any = false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code sets `any` to true, but this change sets it to false, which would cause the regex to match a different set of strings.

DONE.
