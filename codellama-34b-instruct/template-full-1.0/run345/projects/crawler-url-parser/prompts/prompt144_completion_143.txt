  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)(?:\.[a-z]+|$)
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex engine would match less greedily, potentially capturing a different part of the URL path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex engine would match more greedily, potentially capturing a different part of the URL path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)$
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex engine would not match the last forward slash "/" of the URL path.

DONE.
