  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` would be called with an error event instead of the expected `close` event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close', reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain', resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` would be called with the `drain` event instead of the expected `close` event.

DONE.
