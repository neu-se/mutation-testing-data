  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the iterator to skip over the next two elements in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(iter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the iterator to skip over the next `peekLength` elements in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(iter.peekLength() - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the iterator to skip over the next `peekLength - 1` elements in the array.

DONE.
