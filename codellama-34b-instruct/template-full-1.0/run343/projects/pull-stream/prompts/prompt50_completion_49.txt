  DONE.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.name === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because `s` may not have a `name` property, whereas `typeof s` will always return a string indicating the type of `s`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.constructor === Function
```
This would result in different behavior because `s` may have a different constructor than `Function`, whereas `typeof s` will always return the type of `s`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.isFunction()
```
This would result in different behavior because `s` may not have an `isFunction()` method, whereas `typeof s` will always return a string indicating the type of `s`.
