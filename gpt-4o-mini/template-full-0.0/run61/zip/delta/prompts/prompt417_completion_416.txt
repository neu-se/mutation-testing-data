Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek();
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek()` does not advance the iterator, meaning the same operation will be processed repeatedly without moving to the next operation, potentially causing an infinite loop or incorrect index calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(length + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because advancing the iterator by `length + 1` would skip one operation, leading to incorrect transformations and potentially missing important operations in the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because calling `next(0)` effectively does nothing and does not advance the iterator, which could lead to an infinite loop or incorrect handling of the operations in the delta.

DONE.
