  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || false, done || function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` variable is now always `false`, which means that the `read` function will never be called with `abort` set to `true`, even if the `abort` variable is set to `true` later in the code. This could cause the `read` function to continue reading from the stream even after the `abort` function has been called, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
