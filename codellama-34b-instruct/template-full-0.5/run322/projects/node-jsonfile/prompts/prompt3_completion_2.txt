  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `file` variable, which is a string representing the path to the file. Replacing it with `null` would cause the `readFile` function to fail with a `TypeError` when trying to read a file with a null path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `file` variable, which is a string representing the path to the file. Replacing it with `undefined` would cause the `readFile` function to fail with a `TypeError` when trying to read a file with an undefined path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `file` variable, which is a string representing the path to the file. Replacing it with an empty string would cause the `readFile` function to fail with
