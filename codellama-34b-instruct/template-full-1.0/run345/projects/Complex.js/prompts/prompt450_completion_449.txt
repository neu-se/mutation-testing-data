  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil` always rounds up to the next integer, while `Math.abs` returns the absolute value without rounding.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` always rounds down to the previous integer, while `Math.abs` returns the absolute value without rounding.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.round` returns the nearest integer, which can be different from the absolute value, especially for fractional parts.

DONE.
