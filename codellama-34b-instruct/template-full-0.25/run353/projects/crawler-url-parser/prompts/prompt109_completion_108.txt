  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url, currentUrl + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would cause the `currentUrl` object to be coerced into a number, which would result in `NaN`. This would cause the `urlMap.has()` method to fail, and the `urlMap.set()` method to be called with a different key, which would result in a different map being created.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url, currentUrl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because the `protocol` property of the `currentUrl` object would be used as the key for the `urlMap`, instead of the `url` property. This would cause the `urlMap.has()` method to fail, and the `urlMap.set()` method to be called with a different key, which would result in a different map being created.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url, currentUrl
