  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection, reason
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `rejection` variable, while the buggy code fragment is a reference to the `reason` variable. This would cause the `untrackRejection` function to be called with a different argument, which could potentially cause the test suite to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `rejection` variable, while the buggy code fragment is a reference to the `rejection` variable without the `reason` property. This would cause the `untrackRejection` function to be called with a different argument, which could potentially cause the test suite to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection.reason
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `rejection` variable, while the buggy code fragment is a reference
