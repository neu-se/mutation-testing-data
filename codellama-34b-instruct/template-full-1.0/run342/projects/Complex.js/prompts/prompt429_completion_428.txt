  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(10, places || 10)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code raises 10 to the power of the variable `places` or 0, while the mutated code raises 10 to the power of 10 or 0. This would cause the function to always return a value that is a multiple of 10, even if the original function was supposed to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(10, places * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code raises 10 to the power of the variable `places` or 0, while the mutated code raises 10 to the power of twice the value of `places` or 0. This would cause the function to return a value that is always twice as large as the original value, unless `places` is 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be
