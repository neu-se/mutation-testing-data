  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength()` returns the length of the current operation, while `peekType()` returns the type of the current operation. In the original code, the `if` statement checks the type of the current operation, so replacing it with `peekLength()` would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.nextType()
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextType()` returns the type of the next operation, while `peekType()` returns the type of the current operation. In the original code, the `if` statement checks the type of the current operation, so replacing it with `nextType()` would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength
