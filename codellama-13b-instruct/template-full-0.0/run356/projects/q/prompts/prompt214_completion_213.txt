  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseLike
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseLike` is a function that checks if an object is promise-like, whereas `isPromiseAlike` is a function that checks if an object is promise-like and has a `then` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromise` is a function that checks if an object is a promise, whereas `isPromiseAlike` is a function that checks if an object is promise-like and has a `then` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isThenable
```
This would result in different behavior because `isThenable` is a function that checks if an object is thenable, whereas `isPromiseAlike` is a function that checks if an object is promise-like and has a `then` method.

DONE.
