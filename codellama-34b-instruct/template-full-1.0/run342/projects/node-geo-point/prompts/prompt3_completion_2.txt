  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
longitude != -180 || longitude != 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using the logical AND operator (`&&`), which requires both conditions to be true, while the new code is using the logical OR operator (`||`), which only requires one condition to be true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
longitude < -180 && longitude > 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using the logical OR operator (`||`), which allows either condition to be true, while the new code is using the logical AND operator (`&&`), which requires both conditions to be true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
longitude > -180 || longitude < 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using the logical OR operator (`||`), which allows either condition to be true, while the new code is using the logical AND operator (`&&`), which requires both
