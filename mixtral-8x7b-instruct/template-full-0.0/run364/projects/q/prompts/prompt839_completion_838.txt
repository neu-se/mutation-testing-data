 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then()` method treats `null` as a function that does nothing, and the error handling behavior would change.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty function would be passed as the second argument to `then()`, which would change the error handling behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
