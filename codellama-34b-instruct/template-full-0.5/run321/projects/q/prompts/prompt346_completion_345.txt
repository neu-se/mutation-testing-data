  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.message
```
This would result in different behavior because `exception.message` is a string, while `exception` is an object, and the code expects an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because `new Error(exception)` creates a new error object with `exception` as the message, while the original code fragment simply returns the `exception` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because `exception.stack` is a string representing the stack trace at the time the exception was thrown, while the original code fragment simply returns the `exception` object.

DONE.
