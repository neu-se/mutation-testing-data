Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of `options` would cause the `request` function to receive a `null` value, potentially leading to a runtime error or unexpected behavior, as it may not handle `null` inputs properly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ ...options, url: 'http://example.com' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the `options` object by overriding the `url` property with a hardcoded value, which could lead to incorrect behavior if the original `url` was intended to be used.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest + 'extra/path'
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends a string to the `dest` property, which could lead to an invalid destination path being used in the `request` function, potentially causing file writing errors or incorrect file locations.

DONE.
