  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the complex number `z` was zero, while the new code fragment is checking if the function `z['isZero']` is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](z)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the complex number `z` was zero, while the new code fragment is checking if the function `z['isZero']` is zero, and passing `z` as an argument to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](a, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the complex number `z` was zero, while the new code fragment is checking if the function `z['isZero']` is zero, and passing `a` and `b` as arguments to the function.
