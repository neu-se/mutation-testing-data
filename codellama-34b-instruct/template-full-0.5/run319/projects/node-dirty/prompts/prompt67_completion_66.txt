  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(() => this._writeStream.destroy());
```
This would result in different behavior because the `destroy()` method is called on the write stream before it is closed, which could result in data loss or corruption.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(() => this._writeStream.destroy(new Error()));
```
This would result in different behavior because an error is passed to the `destroy()` method, which could cause the write stream to be closed with an error, rather than being closed normally.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(() => this._writeStream.destroy(this._data));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_data` object is passed to the `destroy()` method, which could cause the write stream to be closed with the `_data` object, rather than being closed normally.

DONE.
