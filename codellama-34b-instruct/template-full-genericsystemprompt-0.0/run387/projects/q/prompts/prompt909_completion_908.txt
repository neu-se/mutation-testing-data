  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would return the second element of the array, while the new code fragment would return the first element of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would return the second element of the array, while the new code fragment would return the third element of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
4
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would return the second element of the array, while the new code fragment would return the fourth element of the array.

DONE.
