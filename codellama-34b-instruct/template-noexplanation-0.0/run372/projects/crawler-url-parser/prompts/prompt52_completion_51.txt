  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.path
```
This change will cause the `URL.resolve` function to use the path of the parsed URL as the base URL, which may result in a different URL being resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.query
```
This change will cause the `URL.resolve` function to use the query string of the parsed URL as the base URL, which may result in a different URL being resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.hash
```
This change will cause the `URL.resolve` function to use the hash of the parsed URL as the base URL, which may result in a different URL being resolved.

DONE.
