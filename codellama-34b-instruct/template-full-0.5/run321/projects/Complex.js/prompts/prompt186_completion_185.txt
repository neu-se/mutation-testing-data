  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the values of `a` and `b`, whereas the original code fragment only used the value of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the values of `a` and `b`, whereas the original code fragment only used the value of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would divide the value of `a` by the value of `b`, whereas the original code fragment only used the value of `a`.

DONE.
