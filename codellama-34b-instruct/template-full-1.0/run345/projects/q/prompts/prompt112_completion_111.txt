  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(thisp, [value, index, self])
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` passes the arguments as an array instead of as separate parameters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind(thisp)(value, index, self)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` returns a new function with the specified `this` value and arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call(self, value, index, thisp)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` passes the function's `this` value as the first argument instead of the last.

DONE.
