  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index, 1, newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` parameter would be incremented by 1, which would cause the `splice` method to insert the new operation at the wrong position in the `ops` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index, 0, newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` parameter would be set to 0, which would cause the `splice` method to insert the new operation at the beginning of the `ops` array, rather than at the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index, -1, newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` parameter would be set to -1, which would cause the `splice` method to insert the new operation at the end of the `ops` array, rather than at the beginning.

DONE.
