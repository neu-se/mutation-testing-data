  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise", function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was calling the `definition` function, but the new code fragment is defining a new function that does nothing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise", null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was calling the `definition` function, but the new code fragment is passing `null` instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise", 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was calling the `definition` function, but the new code fragment is passing `0` instead.

DONE.
