  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, distance * 2, bearing
```
This would result in different behavior because the distance parameter is multiplied by 2, which would cause the destination point to be calculated twice as far away from the starting point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, distance, bearing + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing parameter is increased by 180 degrees, which would cause the destination point to be calculated in the opposite direction from the starting point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, distance, bearing * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing parameter is multiplied by 2, which would cause the destination point to be calculated in a direction that is twice as far from the starting point as the original bearing.

DONE.
