  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function ohNo() { throw new Error("Uh oh!"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `regardless` function was replaced with a function that throws an error, causing the promise chain to be rejected early.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `regardless` function was replaced with a null value, which would cause the promise chain to be fulfilled with a value of `null` instead of the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function alsoRegardless() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `regardless` function was replaced with a different function that behaves similarly but has a different implementation. This change could potentially introduce some differences in behavior, depending on how the functions are used in the surrounding code.

DONE.
