  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to return the first element of the array, rather than the next element as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to return the second element of the array, rather than the next element as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to return the third element of the array, rather than the next element as intended.

DONE.
