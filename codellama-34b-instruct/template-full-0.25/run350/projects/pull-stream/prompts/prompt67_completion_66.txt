  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || end !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has a lower precedence than the `&&` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(end || end) !== true`, which would always be true if `end` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && end !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator has a higher precedence than the `&&` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `end && (end !== false)`, which would always be true if `end` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && end !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator has a higher precedence than the `&&` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `end && (end !== null)`, which would always be true if `end` is truthy.

DONE.
