  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isGlob
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `isGlob` function, causing the `if` statement to be entered even if the `src` is not a glob.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',').length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method returns an array of substrings, and the `length` property of an array is the number of elements in the array. If the `src` is a glob, the `length` property will be greater than 1, causing the `if` statement to be entered.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.includes(',')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `includes` method checks if a string contains a specific substring. If the `src` is a glob, the `includes` method will return `true`, causing the `if` statement to be entered.
