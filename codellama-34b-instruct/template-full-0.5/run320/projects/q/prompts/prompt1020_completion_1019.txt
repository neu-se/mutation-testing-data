  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"send"
```
This would result in different behavior because `send` is a different method than `post`, and it may not be defined on the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because `get` is a different method than `post`, and it may not be defined on the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply"
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` is a different method than `post`, and it may not be defined on the object.

DONE.
