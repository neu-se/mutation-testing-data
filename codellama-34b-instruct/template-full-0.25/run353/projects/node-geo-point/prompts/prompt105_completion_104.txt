  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(coordinate.longitude + 180) / 360 * Math.pow(2, zoom - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the zoom level is reduced by one, causing the tile to be calculated at a lower resolution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(coordinate.longitude + 180) / 360 * Math.pow(2, zoom + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the zoom level is increased by one, causing the tile to be calculated at a higher resolution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(coordinate.longitude + 180) / 360 * Math.pow(2, zoom + 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the zoom level is increased by two, causing the tile to be calculated at an even higher resolution.

DONE.
