  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, val + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value stored in the database would be one greater than the original value, which could cause bugs in the code that relies on the correct value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, val + Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the value stored in the database would be a random value between the original value and one greater, which could cause bugs in the code that relies on the correct value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, val - Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the value stored in the database would be a random value between the original value and zero, which could cause bugs in the code that relies on the correct value.

DONE.
