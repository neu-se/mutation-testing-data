  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path + verb, ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator is used instead of the `,` operator, which would cause the `path` and `verb` variables to be concatenated instead of passed as separate arguments to the `query` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, ctx.path
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ctx.path` property is used instead of the `path` variable, which would cause the `query` method to be called with a different path than the one that was originally passed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, ctx.verb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ctx.verb` property is used instead of the `verb` variable, which would cause the `query` method to be called with a different verb than the one that was originally passed.

DONE.
