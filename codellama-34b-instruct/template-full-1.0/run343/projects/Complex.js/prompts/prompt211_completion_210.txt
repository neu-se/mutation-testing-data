  Option 1: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
a, a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment references the `b` variable twice, while the replaced code only references it once.

Option 2: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
b, b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment references the `a` variable twice, while the replaced code only references it once.

Option 3: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
a, b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment references the `b` variable twice, while the replaced code only references it once. In addition, the replaced code fragments refers to the `a` and `b` variables in the opposite order than the original code.

DONE.
