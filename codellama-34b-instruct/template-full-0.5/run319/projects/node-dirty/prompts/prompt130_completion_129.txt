  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, cbs] = this._data.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `for` loop to iterate over the value of the `key` property in the `_data` object, rather than the keys of the `_data` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, cbs] = this._data.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `for` loop to iterate over the keys of the `_data` object, rather than the values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, cbs] = this._data.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `for` loop to iterate over the values of the `_data` object, rather than the keys.

DONE.
