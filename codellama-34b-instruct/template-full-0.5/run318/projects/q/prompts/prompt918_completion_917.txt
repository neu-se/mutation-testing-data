  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` returns a function that takes a single argument, but `deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)` returns a function that takes no arguments, which would cause a runtime error if the function is called with an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` returns a function that takes a single argument, but `deferred.makeNodeResolver(undefined)` returns a function that takes no arguments, which would cause a runtime error if the function is called with an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(42)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` returns a function that takes a single argument, but `deferred.makeNodeResolver(42)` returns a
