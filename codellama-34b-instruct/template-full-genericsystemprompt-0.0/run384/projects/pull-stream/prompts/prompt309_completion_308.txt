  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function is expected to return a boolean value, but `test(data)` would return the result of the `test` function, which could be any type of value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the result of the `test` function, which could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data) && !test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would evaluate to `true` if both `test(data)` and `!test(data)` are `true`, which could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to a different value.

DONE.
