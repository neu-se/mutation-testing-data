  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `abortCb` function instead of the `cb` function, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the second argument to the `map` function, which could cause an error or unexpected behavior in the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `undefined` as the second argument to the `map` function, which could cause an error or unexpected behavior in the program.

DONE.
