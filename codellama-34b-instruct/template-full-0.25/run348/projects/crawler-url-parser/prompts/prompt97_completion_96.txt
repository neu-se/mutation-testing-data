  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl || currentUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would return `currentUrl` if it is truthy, and `currentUrl.url` if it is falsy. In the original code, the `&&` operator is used, which would return `currentUrl.url` if `currentUrl` is truthy, and `undefined` if it is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl ? currentUrl.url : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the ternary operator would return `currentUrl.url` if `currentUrl` is truthy, and `null` if it is falsy. In the original code, the `&&` operator is used, which would return `currentUrl.url` if `currentUrl` is truthy, and `undefined` if it is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url || null
