  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(<PLACEHOLDER> ? passed : failed).push(op);
```
This would result in different behavior because the ternary operator is used to push the `op` object to either the `passed` or `failed` array, depending on the value of `<PLACEHOLDER>`. In the original code, the `push` method is called on the `target` variable, which is assigned to either `passed` or `failed` based on the value of `<PLACEHOLDER>`.
