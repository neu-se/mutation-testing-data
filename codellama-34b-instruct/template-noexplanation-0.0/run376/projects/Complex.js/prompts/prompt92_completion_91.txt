  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + '0'
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it always adds the string "0" instead of "1". This change should not affect the behavior of the code, but it will cause the mutation testing to fail if the test suite is not robust enough to detect the difference.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + '2'
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it always adds the string "2" instead of "1". This change should not affect the behavior of the code, but it will cause the mutation testing to fail if the test suite is not robust enough to detect the difference.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This code fragment is similar to the original, but it always adds the string "a" instead of "1". This change should
