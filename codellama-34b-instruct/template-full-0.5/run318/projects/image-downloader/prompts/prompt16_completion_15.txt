  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `url` property instead of the `dest` property, which could cause the function to save the image to a different location or return an error if the `url` property is not a valid URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.replace(/\.[^/.]+$/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the file extension from the `dest` property, which could cause the function to save the image to a different file or return an error if the `dest` property is not a valid file path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would extract the last segment of the `dest` property, which could cause the function to save the image to a different directory or return an error if the `dest` property is not a valid file path.
