  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` creates a shallow copy of the array, which means that the `for...of` loop would iterate over the copied array instead of the original one. This could cause the loop to skip over some elements or iterate over them multiple times, leading to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.filter(policy => policy.name === name)
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter()` creates a new array with only the elements that match the provided condition. In this case, it would create a new array with only the policies that have the same name as the `name` parameter. This could cause the loop to iterate over a different set of policies than the original code, leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.map(policy => policy.name)
```
This would result in different behavior because `map()` creates a new array
