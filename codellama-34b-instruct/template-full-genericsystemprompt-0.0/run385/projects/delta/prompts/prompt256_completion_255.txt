  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isEqual(thisOp.insert, otherOp.insert) && thisOp.attributes === otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also compare the attributes of the two operations, which is not done in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isEqual(thisOp.insert, otherOp.insert) || thisOp.attributes === otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a logical OR operator instead of a logical AND operator, which would result in a different outcome when the attributes of the two operations are not equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isEqual(thisOp.insert, otherOp.insert) && thisOp.attributes !== otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a logical NOT operator instead of a logical AND operator, which would result in a different outcome when the attributes of the two operations are equal.

DONE.
