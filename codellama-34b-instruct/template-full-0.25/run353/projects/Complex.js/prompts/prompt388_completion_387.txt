  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return the double of the value of `a`, while the modified code fragment would return the double of `a` plus 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return the double of the value of `a`, while the modified code fragment would return the double of `a` minus 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return the double of the value of `a`, while the modified code fragment would return the square of the value of `a`.

DONE.
