  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x['im'] + x['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the real and imaginary parts of the complex number `x` together, which would give a different result than the original code fragment that used the imaginary part of `x` twice.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x['re'] - x['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the imaginary part of `x` from the real part, which would give a different result than the original code fragment that used the imaginary part of `x` twice.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x['im'] * x['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the real and imaginary parts of `x` together, which would give a different result than the original code fragment that used the imaginary part of `x` twice.

DONE.
