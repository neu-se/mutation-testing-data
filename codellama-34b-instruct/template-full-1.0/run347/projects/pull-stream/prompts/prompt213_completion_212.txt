  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `aborted` variable is undefined, and the code would not execute the `if(aborted)` block, even if the `read` function returned an aborted error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `aborted` variable is null, and the code would execute the `if(aborted)` block, even if the `read` function returned a non-aborted error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted.err
```
This would result in different behavior because the `aborted.err` variable is not defined, and the code would throw a reference error.

DONE.
