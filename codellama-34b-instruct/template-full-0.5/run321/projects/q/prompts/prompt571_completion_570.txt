  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` and `apply` are different methods that behave differently when called on a function. `call` calls the function with a specific `this` value and arguments provided individually, while `apply` calls the function with a specific `this` value and arguments provided as an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function that, when called, will have a specific `this` value and arguments provided individually, while `apply` calls the function with a specific `this` value and arguments provided as an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.arrow
```
This would result in different behavior because `arrow` is a syntax error and would cause the code to fail to parse.

DONE.
