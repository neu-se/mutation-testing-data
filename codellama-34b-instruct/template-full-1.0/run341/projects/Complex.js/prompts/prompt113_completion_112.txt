  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this === a && this === b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a` and `b` variables are not used in the original code, and the `this.isZero()` method is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a` and `b` variables are not used in the original code, and the `isZero()` method is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a` and `b` variables are not used in the original code, and the `isZero()` method is not defined.

DONE.
