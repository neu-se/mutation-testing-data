Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof options === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be true for any object, not just strings, potentially causing incorrect handling of options.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
options!== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be true for any non-null value, including objects, strings, numbers, etc., which could lead to incorrect assumptions about the type of options.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
options === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be true when options is undefined, which is the opposite of the original condition, potentially causing the function to behave incorrectly when no options are provided.

DONE.
