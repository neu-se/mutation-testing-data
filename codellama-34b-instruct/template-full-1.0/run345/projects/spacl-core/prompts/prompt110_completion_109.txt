  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (verb in verbs) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `for...in` loop to iterate over the `verbs` object instead of the `verbs` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const verb of verbs) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `for...of` loop to iterate over the `verbs` array instead of the `verbs` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (let i = 0; i < verbs.length; i++) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate over the `verbs` array using traditional `for` loop syntax.

DONE.
