  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(b, a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan2` takes two arguments, `y` and `x`, and returns the arctangent of `y` and `x`, whereas the original code fragment `Math.atan2` takes one argument, `c`, and returns the arctangent of `c`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan` takes one argument, `x`, and returns the arctangent of `x`, whereas the original code fragment `Math.atan2` takes two arguments, `y` and `x`, and returns the arctangent of `y` and `x`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan` takes one argument, `x`, and returns the arctangent
