Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return object[op](args);
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to call the method on the object directly with the arguments as a single array, which would lead to a runtime error if `op` is not a valid method on `object`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return object[op] || function() {};
```
This would result in different behavior because it will return a default empty function if `op` is not a valid property on `object`, potentially leading to silent failures instead of throwing an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return object[op].apply(null, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the context (`this`) to `null`, which may lead to unexpected results if `object[op]` relies on its context for execution.

DONE.
