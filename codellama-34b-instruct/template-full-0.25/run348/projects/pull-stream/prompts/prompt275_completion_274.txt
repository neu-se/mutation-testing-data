  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.pipe(process.stdout)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pipe the stream to the stdout, which is not the intended behavior of the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.pipe(process.stderr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pipe the stream to the stderr, which is not the intended behavior of the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.pipe(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pipe the stream to null, which is not the intended behavior of the original code fragment.

DONE.
