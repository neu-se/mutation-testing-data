  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the parentheses are required to call the `hasNext()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method returns the next element in the iterator, rather than checking if there is a next element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek()` method returns the next element in the iterator without advancing the iterator, rather than checking if there is a next element.

DONE.
