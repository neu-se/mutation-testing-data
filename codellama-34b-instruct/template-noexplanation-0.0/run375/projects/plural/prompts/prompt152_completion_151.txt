  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num + 1
```
This change will cause the `plural` function to always return the plural form of the word, regardless of the value of `num`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num - 1
```
This change will cause the `plural` function to always return the singular form of the word, regardless of the value of `num`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num * 2
```
This change will cause the `plural` function to always return the plural form of the word, but with the number of letters in the word doubled.

DONE.
