  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the `/index.` part of the URL, while this new code fragment would remove the `/index.` part and the following file extension.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the `/index.` part of the URL, while this new code fragment would remove the `/index.` part and replace it with a `/` character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, 'index'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the `/index.` part of the URL, while this new code fragment would remove the `/index.` part and replace it with the string `index`.

DONE.
