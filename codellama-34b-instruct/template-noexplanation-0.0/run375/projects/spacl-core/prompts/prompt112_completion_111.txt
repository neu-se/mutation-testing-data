This change will cause the `allow` method to iterate over the keys of the `verbs` object, rather than the values. This will result in the `allow` method not actually allowing any verbs, as the keys of the `verbs` object are not the same as the allowed verbs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
