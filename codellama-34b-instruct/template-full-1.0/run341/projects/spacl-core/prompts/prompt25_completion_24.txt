  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
final && !opt && min < 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the `min` variable always less than 1, even if it is not actually less than 1, which could cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
final && opt && min > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the `min` variable always greater than 1, even if it is not actually greater than 1, which could cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
final && !opt && min === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the `min` variable always equal to 1, even if it is not actually equal to 1, which could cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`.

DONE.
