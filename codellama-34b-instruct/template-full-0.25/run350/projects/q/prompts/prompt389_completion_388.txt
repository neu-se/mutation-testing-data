  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function is called instead of the `fulfilled` function, which could cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value is not a function, so it would throw an error when called. This could cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value is not a function, so it would throw an error when called. This could cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

DONE.
