  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|index|indices/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only matches "appendix" or "index", while the new code fragment also matches "indices".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|index|indices|indice/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only matches "appendix" or "index", while the new code fragment also matches "indices" and "indice".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|index|indices|indice|indexes/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only matches "appendix" or "index", while the new code fragment also matches "indices", "indice", and "indexes".

DONE.
