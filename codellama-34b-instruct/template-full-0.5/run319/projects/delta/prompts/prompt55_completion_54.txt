  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the result of the `Array.isArray` check, potentially causing the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function to throw an error when it should not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(a) || Array.isArray(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if either `a` or `b` is an array, potentially causing the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function to return a different result than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(a) && Array.isArray(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if both `a` and `b` are arrays, potentially causing the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function to return a different result than expected.

DONE.
