  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]o$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag is removed, causing the regular expression to match only lowercase "o" instead of both lowercase and uppercase "o".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]o$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag is added, causing the regular expression to match all occurrences of "o" instead of just the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]o$/m
```
This would result in different behavior because the `m` flag is added, causing the regular expression to match "o" only at the end of a line instead of just at the end of the string.

DONE.
