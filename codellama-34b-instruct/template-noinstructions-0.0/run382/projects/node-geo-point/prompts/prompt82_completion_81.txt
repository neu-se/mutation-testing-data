  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `sin` function to calculate the sine of the latitude, while this replacement code fragment uses the `sin` function to calculate the sine of the longitude.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `cos` function to calculate the cosine of the latitude, while this replacement code fragment uses the `cos` function to calculate the cosine of the longitude.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `tan` function to calculate the tangent of the latitude, while this replacement code fragment uses the `tan` function to calculate the tangent of the longitude.

DONE.
