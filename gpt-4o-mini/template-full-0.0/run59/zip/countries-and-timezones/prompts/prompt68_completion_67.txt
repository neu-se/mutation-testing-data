Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if `country` is explicitly `null`, while the original check (`!country`) also considers `undefined` and other falsy values, potentially allowing invalid countries to be memoized.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country.id === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it specifically checks if the `id` property of `country` is `undefined`, which would allow valid country objects with an `id` property to be memoized, even if the country itself is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `country` is strictly equal to `true`, which is not a valid state for a country object, thus bypassing the memoization logic entirely for any valid country object.

DONE.
