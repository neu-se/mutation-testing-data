  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = Q.stacktrace
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.onerror` is a function that handles errors, while `Q.stacktrace` is a function that generates stack traces.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = Q.stacktrace.cancel
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.onerror` is a function that handles errors, while `Q.stacktrace.cancel` is a function that cancels the generation of stack traces.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = Q.stacktrace.refresh
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.onerror` is a function that handles errors, while `Q.stacktrace.refresh` is a function that refreshes the stack traces.

DONE.
