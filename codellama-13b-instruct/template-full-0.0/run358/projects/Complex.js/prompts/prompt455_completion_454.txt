  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` method checks if the real and imaginary parts of the complex number are `NaN`, while the `isInfinite` method checks if the real and imaginary parts of the complex number are `Infinity`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` method checks if the real and imaginary parts of the complex number are `NaN`, while the `isZero` method checks if the real and imaginary parts of the complex number are both zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` method checks if the real and imaginary parts of the complex number are `NaN`, while the `isFinite` method checks if the real and imaginary parts of the complex number are both finite.

DONE.
