  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mice', 'mice'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a tuple of two elements, while the new code fragment is a tuple of one element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mice', 'mouse'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a tuple of two elements, while the new code fragment is a tuple of two elements with the same value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mice', 'mouses'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a tuple of two elements, while the new code fragment is a tuple of two elements with different values.

DONE.
