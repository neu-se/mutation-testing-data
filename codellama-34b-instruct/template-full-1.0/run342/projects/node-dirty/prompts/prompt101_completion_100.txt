  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val == undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the double equals sign `==` would check for both `null` and `undefined`, whereas the triple equals sign `===` checks for only `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the triple equals sign `===` checks for only `undefined`, whereas the exclamation mark `!==` checks for both `null` and `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!row.val
```
This would result in different behavior because the logical NOT operator `!` checks for both `null` and `undefined`, whereas the double equals sign `==` checks for only `undefined`.

DONE.
