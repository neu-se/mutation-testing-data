  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || !done
```
This would result in different behavior because `done` is negated, which means the callback will only be called if `done` is explicitly set to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && !done
```
This would result in different behavior because `abort` is negated, which means the callback will only be called if `abort` is explicitly set to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because `abort` is negated, which means the callback will only be called if `abort` is explicitly set to `true`.

DONE.
