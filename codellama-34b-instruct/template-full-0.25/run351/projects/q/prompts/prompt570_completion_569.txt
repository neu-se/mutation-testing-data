  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result, errback, callback
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, which could cause the function to behave differently if it relies on the order of the arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result, callback, errback
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is the same as the original code, so the function would behave the same way.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result, callback, errback, result
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument is added to the end of the argument list, which could cause the function to behave differently if it relies on the number of arguments passed to it.

DONE.
