  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the complex number is zero, while the buggy code fragment would always return false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the complex number is zero, while the buggy code fragment would always return false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the complex number is zero, while the buggy code fragment would always return false.

DONE.
