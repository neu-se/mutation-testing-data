Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `rest` method to return the operations starting from the next index instead of the current index, potentially skipping the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to slice the operations from the previous index, which could lead to an incorrect subset of operations being returned, especially if the index is already at the start.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the operations starting from the beginning of the list, regardless of the current index, which could lead to returning operations that have already been processed.

DONE.
