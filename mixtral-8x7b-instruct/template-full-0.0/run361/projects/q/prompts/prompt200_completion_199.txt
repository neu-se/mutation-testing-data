 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"<error object>'.stack"
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to access the `stack` property of a string, which would result in `undefined`, instead of an array from splitting the stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
e.stack.split("")
