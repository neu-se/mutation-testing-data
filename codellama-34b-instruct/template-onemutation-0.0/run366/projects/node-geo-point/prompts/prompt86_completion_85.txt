  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1) * cosδ + cosφ1 * sinδ * cosθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `sin` function to calculate the sine of the angular distance, but the replaced code fragment uses the `sin` function to calculate the sine of the latitude of the first point.

DONE.
