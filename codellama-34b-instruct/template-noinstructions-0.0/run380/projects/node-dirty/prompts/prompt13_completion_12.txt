  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would not be called, even if the key is not in the cache.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be called with `undefined` as the first argument, even if the key is not in the cache.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be called with an empty object as the first argument, even if the key is not in the cache.

DONE.
