  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the key to be incremented by 1, which would likely result in a different property being accessed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key * 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the key to be multiplied by 2, which would likely result in a different property being accessed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the key to be decremented by 1, which would likely result in a different property being accessed.

DONE.
