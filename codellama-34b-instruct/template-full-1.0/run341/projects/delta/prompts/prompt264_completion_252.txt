  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the `retain` attribute of `otherOp` to `thisOp`, instead of comparing the `attributes` attribute of both ops.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the `insert` attribute of `otherOp` to `thisOp`, instead of comparing the `attributes` attribute of both ops.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the `retain` attribute of `thisOp` to `thisOp`, instead of comparing the `attributes` attribute of both ops.

DONE.
