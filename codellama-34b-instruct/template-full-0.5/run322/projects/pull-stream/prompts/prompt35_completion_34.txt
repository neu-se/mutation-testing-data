  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always use the first argument as the source, rather than the second argument as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always use the third argument as the source, rather than the second argument as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always use the fourth argument as the source, rather than the second argument as intended.

DONE.
