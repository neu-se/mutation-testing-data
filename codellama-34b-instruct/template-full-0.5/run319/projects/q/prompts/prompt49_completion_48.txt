  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("This is a bug");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment did not throw an error, but the modified code fragment would throw an error unconditionally.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would continue executing the rest of the function, but the modified code fragment would return immediately without executing the rest of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return "This is a bug";
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return `undefined`, but the modified code fragment would return the string "This is a bug".

DONE.
