  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is case-sensitive, while the new code fragment is case-insensitive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for a specific path, while the new code fragment is checking for the length of the path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for a specific path, while the new code fragment is checking for the path segments.

DONE.
