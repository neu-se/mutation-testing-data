  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = lastOp.attributes
```
This change will cause the `newOp` object to have the same `attributes` property as the `lastOp` object, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = { ...lastOp.attributes }
```
This change will cause the `newOp` object to have a new `attributes` property that is a shallow copy of the `attributes` property of the `lastOp` object. This is not the intended behavior, as the `attributes` property should be a deep copy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = deepCopy(lastOp.attributes)
```
This change will cause the `newOp` object to have a new `attributes` property that is a deep copy of the `attributes` property of the `lastOp` object. This is the intended behavior, as the `attributes` property should be a deep copy.
