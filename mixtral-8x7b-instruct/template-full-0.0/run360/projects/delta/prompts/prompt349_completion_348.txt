 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.assign({}, AttributeMap.invert)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of the `invert` method, which would not have the correct context when called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.isArray(AttributeMap.invert) ? AttributeMap.invert : []
