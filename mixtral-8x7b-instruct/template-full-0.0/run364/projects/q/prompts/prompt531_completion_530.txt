 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method of the returned promise would now return `{ state: "fulfilled", value: null }` instead of an object with a `<PLACEHOLDER>` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method of the returned promise would now return `{ state: "fulfilled", value: {} }` instead of an object with a `<PLACEHOLDER>` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(){}
