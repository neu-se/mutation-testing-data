  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(obj, replacer, spaces)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the original `JSON.stringify` function instead of the custom `stringify` function, which could lead to different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(obj, replacer, spaces + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra space to the output, which could cause the tests to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(obj, replacer, spaces - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove a space from the output, which could cause the tests to fail.

DONE.
