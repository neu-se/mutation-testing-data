  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude and longitude values are swapped, meaning that the distance calculation would be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because a random value would be used for the latitude, leading to incorrect distance calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 -point2.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude value would be negated, leading to incorrect distance calculations.

DONE.
