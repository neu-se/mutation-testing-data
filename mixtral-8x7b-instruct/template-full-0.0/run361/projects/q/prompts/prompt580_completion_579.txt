 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `errback` function is redefined, causing the `continuer` function to always call the `callback` instead of handling exceptions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
continuer.bind(this, "next")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `errback` function will not be defined, and any errors thrown in the generator will not be caught and handled properly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
continuer.bind(window, "throw")
