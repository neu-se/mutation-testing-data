  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue even if there are no more operations to iterate over, leading to an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate over the length of the next operation, rather than the operation itself, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate over the next operation, rather than the current operation, leading to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
