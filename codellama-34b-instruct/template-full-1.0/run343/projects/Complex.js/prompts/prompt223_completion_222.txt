  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because when r is negative, the original code would calculate the complex square root of a negative number, while this modified code would calculate the complex square root of a positive number (r + 1).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * r
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the complex square root of a single number (r), while this modified code calculates the complex square root of twice that number (2 * r).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the complex square root of a single number (r), while this modified code calculates the complex square root of half that number (r / 2).

DONE.
