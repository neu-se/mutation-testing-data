  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `arguments` object to access the function arguments, while the new code fragment uses the `ref` array to access the function arguments. This could result in different behavior if the function is called with a different number of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3], ref[4])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only uses the first 4 arguments, while the new code fragment uses all 5 arguments. This could result in different behavior if the function is called with a different number of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3], ref[4], ref[5])
```
This would result in
