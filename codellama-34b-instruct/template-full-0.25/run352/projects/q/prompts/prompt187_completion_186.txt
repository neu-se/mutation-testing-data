  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split(" ").reverse().join(" ")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the words in the stack trace, which would make it difficult to read and understand.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the stack trace all uppercase, which would make it difficult to read and understand.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.replace("at", "from")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the word "at" with "from" in the stack trace, which would make it difficult to understand the context of the error.

DONE.
