  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb.toLowerCase()
```
This change will cause the `query` method to always return `null`, as the `verb` variable is not modified and will always be a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb.toUpperCase()
```
This change will cause the `query` method to always return `null`, as the `verb` variable is not modified and will always be a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This change will cause the `query` method to always return `null`, as the `verb` variable is not modified and will always be a string.

DONE.
