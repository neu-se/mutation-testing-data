  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const [key, val] of this._data.entries())
```
This would result in different behavior because `entries()` returns an iterator of key-value pairs, whereas the original code fragment uses `for...of` to iterate over the keys directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const key of this._data.keys())
```
This would result in different behavior because `keys()` returns an iterator of just the keys, whereas the original code fragment uses `for...of` to iterate over the key-value pairs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const val of this._data.values())
```
This would result in different behavior because `values()` returns an iterator of just the values, whereas the original code fragment uses `for...of` to iterate over the key-value pairs.

DONE.
