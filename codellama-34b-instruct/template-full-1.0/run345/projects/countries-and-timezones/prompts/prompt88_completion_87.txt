  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Hello World"

This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `tzName`, which was a string that represented a timezone name. Replacing it with `"Hello World"` would cause the `getTimezone()` function to return a different timezone, rather than the intended timezone with the name "Hello World".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1234
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `tzName`, which was a string that represented a timezone name. Replacing it with `1234` would cause the `getTimezone()` function to return a different timezone, rather than the intended timezone with the name "1234".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `tzName`, which was a string that represented a timezone name. Replacing it with `null` would cause the `getTimezone()` function to return
