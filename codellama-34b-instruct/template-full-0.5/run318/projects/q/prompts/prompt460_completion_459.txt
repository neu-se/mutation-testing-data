  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false`, even if the promise is rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true`, even if the promise is fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true`, even if the promise is rejected.

DONE.
