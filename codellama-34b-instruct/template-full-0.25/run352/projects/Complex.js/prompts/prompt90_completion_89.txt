  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + tokens[i + 1] + '1'

This would result in different behavior because the additional '1' would cause the result of the expression to always be a string, whereas the original code would result in a number if the expression was a valid number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + tokens[i + 1] + '0'
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional '0' would cause the result of the expression to always be a string, whereas the original code would result in a number if the expression was a valid number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + tokens[i + 1] + 'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional 'a' would cause the result of the expression to always be a string, whereas the original code would result in
