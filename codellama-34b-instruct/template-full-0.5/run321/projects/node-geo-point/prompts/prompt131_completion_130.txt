  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the value of `zoom`, which is used in the calculation of the tile coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increase the value of `zoom` by 1, which would affect the calculation of the tile coordinates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the value of `zoom`, which would affect the calculation of the tile coordinates.

DONE.
