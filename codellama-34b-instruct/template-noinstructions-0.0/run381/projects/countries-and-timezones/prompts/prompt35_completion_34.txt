  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(input)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor()` rounds down to the nearest integer, while `Math.abs()` returns the absolute value of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil(input)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil()` rounds up to the nearest integer, while `Math.abs()` returns the absolute value of a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round(input)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.round()` rounds to the nearest integer, while `Math.abs()` returns the absolute value of a number.

DONE.
