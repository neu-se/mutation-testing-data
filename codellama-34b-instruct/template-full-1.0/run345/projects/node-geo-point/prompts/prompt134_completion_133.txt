  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
input.toPrecision(precision)
```
This would result in different behavior because `.toFixed(n)` rounds a number to `n` decimal places, while `.toPrecision(n)` formats a number to `n` significant digits.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
input.toFixed(Math.abs(precision))
```
This would result in different behavior because `.toFixed(n)` rounds a number to `n` decimal places, while `.toFixed(Math.abs(n))` rounds a number to the absolute value of `n` decimal places.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
input.toFixed(precision + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `.toFixed(n)` rounds a number to `n` decimal places, while `.toFixed(n + 1)` rounds a number to one more decimal place than `n`.

DONE.
