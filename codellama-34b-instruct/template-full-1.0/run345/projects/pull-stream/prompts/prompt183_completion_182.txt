  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute if `i` is less than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i === array.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute one extra time if `i` is equal to `array.length + 1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i >= array.length && i % 2 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only execute if `i` is greater than or equal to `array.length` and `i` is even.

DONE.
