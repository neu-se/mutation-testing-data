  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `s` is a function, and `s + 1` would result in a different function that is not equivalent to the original.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `s` is a function, and `s * 2` would result in a different function that is not equivalent to the original.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `s` is a function, and `s - 1` would result in a different function that is not equivalent to the original.

DONE.
