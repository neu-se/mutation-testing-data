  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
untrackRejection(this);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the rejection to be tracked again, even if it had previously been untracked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackRejection(this);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the rejection to be tracked again, even if it had previously been untracked.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
untrackRejection(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the rejection to be untracked, even if it had previously been tracked.

DONE.
