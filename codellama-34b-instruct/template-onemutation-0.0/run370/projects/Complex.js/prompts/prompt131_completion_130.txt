  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `isInfinite` method, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when the value is not infinite, and `false` when it is infinite. This would cause the function to return `Complex['NAN']` when it should return `Complex['INFINITY']`, and vice versa.
