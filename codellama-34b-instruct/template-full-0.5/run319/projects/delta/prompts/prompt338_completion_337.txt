  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the base index by 1, which would cause the slice method to return a different slice of the base delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the base index by 1, which would cause the slice method to return a different slice of the base delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the base index, which would cause the slice method to return a different slice of the base delta.

DONE.
