  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first character of the captured group, which may not be intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the last character of the captured group, which may not be intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the captured group, which may not be intended.

DONE.
