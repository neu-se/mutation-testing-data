  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.attributes` is an object, and `op.attributes[0]` would return the first attribute of the object, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.attributes` is an object, and `op.attributes.length` would return the number of attributes in the object, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.attributes` is an object, and `op.attributes.keys()` would return an array of the keys in the object, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
