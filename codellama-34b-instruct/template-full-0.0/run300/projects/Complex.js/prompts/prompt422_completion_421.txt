  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isZero'](0)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the complex number is zero, while this new code fragment checks if the complex number is equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isZero'](1)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the complex number is zero, while this new code fragment checks if the complex number is equal to 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isZero'](-1)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the complex number is zero, while this new code fragment checks if the complex number is equal to -1.

DONE.
