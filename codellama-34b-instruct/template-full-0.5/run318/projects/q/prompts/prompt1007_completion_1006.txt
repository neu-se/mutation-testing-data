  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a reversed version of the `nodeArgs` array, which would likely cause the `nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver())` line to fail, as the `push` method would be called on a string instead of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return the length of the `nodeArgs` array, which would cause the `nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver())` line to fail, as the `push` method would be called on a number instead of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return the last element of the `nodeArgs` array, which would cause the `
