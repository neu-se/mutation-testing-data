  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `φ1` and `φ2` are the latitudes of the two points, and using `φ1` instead of `φ2` would result in calculating the bearing between the two points with the same latitude, which would always return a bearing of 0 degrees.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 + 90
```
This would result in different behavior because adding 90 degrees to `φ2` would change the bearing calculation to reference a point with a different latitude than the original point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2
```
This would result in different behavior because `λ2` is the longitude of the destination point, and using it in the bearing calculation would result in a different bearing than what is intended.

DONE.
