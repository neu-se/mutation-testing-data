  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `insert` property of the `op` object to be used instead of the `delete` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `attributes` property of the `op` object to be used instead of the `delete` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `delete` property of the `op` object to be set to `1` instead of the actual value of the `delete` property.

DONE.
