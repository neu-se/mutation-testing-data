  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('read_close');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits the 'read_close' event only when the read stream is closed, while the new code emits it immediately after the read stream is created.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('write_close');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits the 'write_close' event only when the write stream is closed, while the new code emits it immediately after the write stream is created.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('Invalid state'));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not emit an 'error' event with the message 'Invalid state', while the new code does.

DONE.
