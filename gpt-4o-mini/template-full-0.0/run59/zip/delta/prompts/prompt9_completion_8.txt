Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const key = 'nonExistentKey';
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to always skip the assignment to `attributes`, as `a[key]` would always be `undefined`, leading to potentially missing attributes from `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const key of Object.keys(a)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the iteration method, potentially leading to different keys being processed if `a` is not a simple object, as it would iterate over the keys of `a` rather than the properties directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const key in b) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate over the keys of `b` instead of `a`, which would lead to incorrect assignments to `attributes`, as it would ignore the values from `a` entirely.

DONE.
