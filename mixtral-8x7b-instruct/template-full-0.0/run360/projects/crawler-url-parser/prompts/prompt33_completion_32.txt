 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/).+/, 'http://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches any string that doesn't start with `http://` or `https://`, and then replaces the matched string with `http://`. This is different from the original code fragment, which only adds `http://` when the input string doesn't start with `http://`, `https://`, or `//`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
