  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!_read
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the truthiness of `_read`, potentially causing the `nextChunk()` function to be called when it should not be.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read && _read.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would only evaluate the right-hand side of the expression if `_read` is truthy, potentially causing the `nextStream()` function to be called when it should not be.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read || _read.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would only evaluate the right-hand side of the expression if `_read` is falsy, potentially causing the `nextChunk()` function to be called when it should not be.

DONE.
