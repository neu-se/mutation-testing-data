  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ms + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the timeout would be increased by 1 millisecond.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ms - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the timeout would be decreased by 1 millisecond.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ms * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the timeout would be doubled.

DONE.
