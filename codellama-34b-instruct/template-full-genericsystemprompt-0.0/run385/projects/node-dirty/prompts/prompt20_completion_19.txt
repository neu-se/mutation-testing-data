  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush(true);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the flush to happen immediately, even if the queue is not full.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush(false);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prevent the flush from happening, even if the queue is full.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush(this._queue.size > 100);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only flush the queue if it has more than 100 items, instead of flushing it when it reaches the maximum size.

DONE.
