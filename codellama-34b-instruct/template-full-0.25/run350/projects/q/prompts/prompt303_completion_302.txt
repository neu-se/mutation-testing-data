  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at 1 instead of 0, potentially skipping the first element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
len = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute, as the length of the array is now 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = len
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at the end of the array instead of the beginning, potentially causing the loop to never execute or to execute in reverse.

DONE.
