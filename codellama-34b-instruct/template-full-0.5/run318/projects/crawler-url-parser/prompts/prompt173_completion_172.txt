  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.error
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.error` is a different method than `console.log` and would produce a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.warn
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.warn` is a different method than `console.log` and would produce a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.info
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.info` is a different method than `console.log` and would produce a different output.

DONE.
