 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
arguments.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function would only be called if there are more than 1 arguments provided to the nodeback. The original code fragment `arguments.length > 2` checks if there are more than 2 arguments, ensuring that the `resolve` function is called with an array of arguments when there are more than 2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function would always be called with the value `0` as the first argument, instead of the actual value or error. This would cause the promise to always resolve with the value `0`, even if an error occurred.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.resolve(array_slice(arguments))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function would always be called with a promise that resolves to an array of all arguments
