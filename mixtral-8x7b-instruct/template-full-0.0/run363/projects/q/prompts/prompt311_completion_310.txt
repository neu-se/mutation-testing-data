 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve(answerPs[i])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve` will immediately resolve the promise, bypassing the original logic that checks for the settled state of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.when(answerPs[i])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when` wraps an object in a promise if it is not already a promise, which may not behave as expected if `answerPs[i]` is not a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.fcall(function() { return answerPs[i]; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fcall` creates a promise that is immediately resolved with the result of the given function, which may not behave as expected if `answerPs[i]` is not a promise.

DONE.
