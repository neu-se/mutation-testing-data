  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the array element being accessed is different. In the original code, the element at index 2 is accessed, but in the mutated code, the element at index 3 is accessed instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the array element being accessed is different. In the original code, the element at index 2 is accessed, but in the mutated code, the element at index 0 is accessed instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is accessing the length of the array instead of an element at a specific index. In the original code, the element at index 2 is accessed, but in the mutated code, the length of the array is accessed instead.

DONE.
