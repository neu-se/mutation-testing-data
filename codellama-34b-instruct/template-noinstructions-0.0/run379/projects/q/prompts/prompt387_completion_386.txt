  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called with `null` as the first argument, which would cause the promise to be resolved with `null` instead of the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called with `undefined` as the first argument, which would cause the promise to be resolved with `undefined` instead of the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("test")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called with an error object as the first argument, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the error instead of being resolved with the original value.

DONE.
