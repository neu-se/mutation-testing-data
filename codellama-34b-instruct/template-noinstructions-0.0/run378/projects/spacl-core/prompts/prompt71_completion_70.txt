  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"verb"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` method would always return `true` for any `verb`, regardless of whether the rule allows it or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"verb" + " "
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` method would always return `true` for any `verb` followed by a space, regardless of whether the rule allows it or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"verb" + " " + "*"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` method would always return `true` for any `verb` followed by a space and then any number of wildcard characters, regardless of whether the rule allows it or not.

DONE.
