 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject` creates a new rejected promise, while `reject` is a reference to the `Q.reject` function. This change would cause the code to always create a new rejected promise instead of using the provided `exception`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

deferred.reject
```

```javascript
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is called with the `exception` argument in the original code. Changing it to `deferred.resolve` would cause the error to be treated as a successful resolution instead of a rejection, which might
