  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.rejectAll
```
This would result in different behavior because deferred.rejectAll will reject all pending promises with the reject reason, whereas deferred.reject would only reject the promise returned by Q.denodeify.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.remove
```
This would result in different behavior because deferred.remove would remove the resolved value, whereas deferred.reject would keep it as a resolved value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.not
```
This would result in different behavior because deferred.not would negate the resolved value of deferred.reject, whereas deferred.reject would keep it as a resolved value.

DONE.
