  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` function would be called with a different argument, which could cause the function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` function would be called with a different argument, which could cause the function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` function would be called with a different argument, which could cause the function to return a different result.

DONE.
