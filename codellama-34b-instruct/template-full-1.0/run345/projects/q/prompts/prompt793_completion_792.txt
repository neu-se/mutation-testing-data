  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var progressed = Promise.resolve(arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve(arguments)` returns a promise that is already fulfilled, while `Q(object).then` returns a promise that may or may not be fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressed = Promise.reject(arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject(arguments)` returns a promise that is already rejected, while `Q(object).then` returns a promise that may or may not be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressed = Promise.race(arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.race(arguments)` returns a promise that resolves or rejects as soon as the value returned by the first argument is resolved or rejected, while `Q(object).then` returns a promise that may or may not be resolved or rejected.

DONE.
