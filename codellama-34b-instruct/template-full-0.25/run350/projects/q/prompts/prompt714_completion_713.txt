  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` would cause the `dispatch` method to return a rejected promise, whereas `Q` would return a resolved promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer` would create a new deferred object, whereas `Q` would return the existing deferred object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when` would return a promise that is resolved with the value of the promise passed to it, whereas `Q` would return the promise itself.

DONE.
