  Sure, here are three mutated code fragments with different behavior than the original code fragment, along with brief explanations of why they result in different behavior:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude + this.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses both the latitude and longitude values to create a new GeoPoint object, while the mutated code fragment only uses the latitude and longitude values separately, leading to a different set of resulting coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude - this.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses both the latitude and longitude values to create a new GeoPoint object, while the mutated code fragment only uses the longitude value minus the latitude value, leading to a different set of resulting coordinates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.tiles.getTile(this.latitude, this.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original
