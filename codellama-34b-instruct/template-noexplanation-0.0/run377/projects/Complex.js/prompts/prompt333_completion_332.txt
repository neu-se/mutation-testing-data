  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === -2
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` when `b` is equal to `-1`, which is the expected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== -1
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `b` is not equal to `-1`, which is the expected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === -1.0
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `b` is equal to `-1.0`, which is the expected behavior.

DONE.
