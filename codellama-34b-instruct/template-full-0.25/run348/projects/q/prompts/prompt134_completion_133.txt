  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for strict equality, while this replacement would check for equality with an offset of 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for strict equality, while this replacement would check for equality with a scaled value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for strict equality, while this replacement would check for equality with a negative offset.

DONE.
