  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete", [value]
```
This change will cause the `del` method to delete the value of the `value` variable instead of the `key` property, which may cause unexpected behavior in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete", [this.key]
```
This change will cause the `del` method to delete the `key` property of the current object instead of the `key` property of the `object` parameter, which may cause unexpected behavior in the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete", [object.key]
```
This change will cause the `del` method to delete the `key` property of the `object` parameter instead of the `key` property of the current object, which may cause unexpected behavior in the program.

DONE.
