  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => seg + acc + '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra '/' to the end of the path, which would cause the matcher to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => seg + acc + '.'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra '.' to the end of the path, which would cause the matcher to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => seg + acc + '*'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra '*' to the end of the path, which would cause the matcher to fail.

DONE.
