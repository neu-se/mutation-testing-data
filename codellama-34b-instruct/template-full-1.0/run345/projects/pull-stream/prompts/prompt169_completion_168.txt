  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, abort, onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because it is equivalent to the original code fragment, but with the order of the arguments changed. This would not catch any errors in the test suite, as the function would still behave the same way with the same inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, cb, onAbort
```
