  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw exception
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is catching the exception, but the modified code would throw it, causing the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("new exception message")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using the exception object as the reason for rejection, but the modified code would use a different exception object with a different message, causing the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.reject(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using the reject function to reject the promise, but the modified code would use the promise's reject method, which could potentially be overridden by the user, causing the test to fail.

DONE.
