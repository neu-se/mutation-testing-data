  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

src, true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `src, false` would only include files that match the glob pattern in the `src` directory, while the new code fragment `src, true` would include both files and directories.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src + "/*", false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `src, false` would only include files that match the glob pattern in the `src` directory, while the new code fragment `src + "/*", false` would include all files and directories in the `src` directory and its subdirectories.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"**/*", false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `src, false` would only include files that match the glob pattern in the `src` directory, while the new code fragment `"**/*", false` would include all files and directories in the current working directory and its
