  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The options.url is not required')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, which could cause the test to fail if it is expecting the specific error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The options.dest is not required')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, which could cause the test to fail if it is expecting the specific error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Invalid options')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, which could cause the test to fail if it is expecting the specific error message.

DONE.
