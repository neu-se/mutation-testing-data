  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function takes a single argument, but `φ1` is a variable that represents the latitude of a point on the Earth's surface.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function takes a single argument, but `φ1` is a variable that represents the latitude of a point on the Earth's surface.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tan` function takes a single argument, but `φ1` is a variable that represents the latitude of a point on the Earth's surface.

DONE.
