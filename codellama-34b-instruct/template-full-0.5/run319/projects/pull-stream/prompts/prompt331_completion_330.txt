  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `once` function with `null` as the argument, which would set `a` to `true` and call `onEnd` with `null` as the argument, even if the `read` function did not return an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `once` function with `true` as the argument, which would set `a` to `true` and call `onEnd` with `true` as the argument, even if the `read` function did not return an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `once` function with `false` as the argument, which would not set `a` to `true` and would not call `onEnd`.

DONE.
