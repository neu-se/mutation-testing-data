 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
channel.port1.onmessage = function () {};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flush` function will not be called when the message is received in `channel.port1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
flush();
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush` is called immediately, rather than being called as a callback when the message is received in `channel.port1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
requestTick();
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` is called immediately, rather than being called as a callback when the message is received in `channel.port1`. It would also cause an infinite loop as `requestTick` calls `flush` which then calls `requestTick` again.

DONE.
