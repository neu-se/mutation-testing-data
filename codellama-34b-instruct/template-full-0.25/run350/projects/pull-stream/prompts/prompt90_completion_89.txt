  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `test` function, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if the `test` function returns `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data) && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator short-circuits the evaluation of the `if` statement, causing it to always evaluate to `false` regardless of the result of the `test` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data) || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator short-circuits the evaluation of the `if` statement, causing it to always evaluate to `true` regardless of the result of the `test` function.

DONE.
