  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.fromCharCode(0x0000)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the Unicode code point U+0000, which is the null character, instead of the null character placeholder.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.fromCharCode(0x0001)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the Unicode code point U+0001, which is the start of heading character, instead of the null character placeholder.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.fromCharCode(0x0002)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the Unicode code point U+0002, which is the start of text character, instead of the null character placeholder.

DONE.
