  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezonesMap === null
```
This change will cause the `getTimezonesMap` function to always rebuild the timezones map, even if it has already been built. This could potentially cause performance issues or other bugs if the function is called frequently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezonesMap.length === 0
```
This change will cause the `getTimezonesMap` function to only rebuild the timezones map if it is empty. This could potentially cause bugs if the function is called with a non-empty timezones map, but the map is not properly updated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezonesMap.size === 0
```
This change will cause the `getTimezonesMap` function to only rebuild the timezones map if it is empty. This could potentially cause bugs if the function is called with a non-empty timezones map, but the map is not properly updated.
