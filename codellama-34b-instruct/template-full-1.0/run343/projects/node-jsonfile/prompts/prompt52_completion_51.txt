  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"${EOL}${obj}"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the EOL character and the obj variable in the result, while the original code would only include the obj variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"${obj}${EOF}"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the EOF character and the obj variable in the result, while the original code would only include the obj variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"${obj}"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only include the obj variable in the result, while the original code would also include the EOL and EOF characters.

DONE.
