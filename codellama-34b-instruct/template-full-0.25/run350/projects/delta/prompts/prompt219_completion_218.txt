  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops !== other.ops
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality, while this replacement checks for inequality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length === other.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality of the `ops` properties, while this replacement checks for equality of the lengths of the `ops` arrays.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length !== other.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality of the `ops` properties, while this replacement checks for inequality of the lengths of the `ops` arrays.

DONE.
