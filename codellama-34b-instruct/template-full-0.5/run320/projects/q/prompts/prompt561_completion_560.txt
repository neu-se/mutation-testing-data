  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.value
```
This would result in different behavior because `exception.value` would be `undefined` if the exception is not a `StopIteration` exception, while `exception` would be the actual exception object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.message
```
This would result in different behavior because `exception.message` would be the error message associated with the exception, while `exception` would be the actual exception object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because `exception.stack` would be the stack trace associated with the exception, while `exception` would be the actual exception object.

DONE.
