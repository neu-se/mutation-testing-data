  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `abort`, so if `abort` is `true`, the function would return `false`, and if `abort` is `false`, the function would return `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add 1 to the value of `abort`, so if `abort` is `true`, the function would return `2`, and if `abort` is `false`, the function would return `1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort ? null : undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `?` operator checks if `abort` is `true` or `false`, and if it is `true`, the function would return `null`, and if it is `false`, the function would return `undefined`.
