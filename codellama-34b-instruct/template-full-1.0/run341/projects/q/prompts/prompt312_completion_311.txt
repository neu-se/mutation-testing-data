  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
answerPs[i+1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always skip the first promise in the array, and instead use the second promise as the conditional for resolution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
answerPs[answerPs.length - i - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always use the last promise in the array, instead of the first one, to determine whether the promise should be resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(answerPs[i] + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always add 1 to the value of the current promise, and then pass that value to Q, instead of passing the actual promise object.

DONE.
