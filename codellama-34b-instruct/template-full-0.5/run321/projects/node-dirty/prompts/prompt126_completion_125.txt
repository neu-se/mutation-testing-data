  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different. The original code emits a `'write_close'` event, but this replacement would emit a `'close'` event instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'write_close'
```
This would result in the same behavior as the original code, as the event name remains the same.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'write_close'
```
This would also result in the same behavior as the original code, as the event name remains the same.

DONE.
