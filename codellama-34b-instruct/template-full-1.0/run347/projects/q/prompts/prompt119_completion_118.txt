  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`Object.keys()`
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys()` is a function that returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property names, in the same order as we get with a normal loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`Object.values()`
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values()` is a function that returns an array of a given object's own enumerable string-keyed property values, in the same order as we get with a normal loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`Object.entries()`
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries()` is a function that returns an array of a given object's own enumerable string-keyed property [key, value] pairs, in the same order as we get with a normal loop.

DONE.
