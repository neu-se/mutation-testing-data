Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return data * 2 }
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the mapping function to multiply the input data by 2, which alters the expected output and may lead to incorrect results if the original intention was to apply a different transformation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return data + '!' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the mapping function to concatenate a string to the input data, which could lead to type coercion issues and unexpected results if the input data is not a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return undefined }
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the mapping function to always return `undefined`, which would cause the output to be `null` when `end` is false, potentially leading to loss of data and incorrect handling of the read operation.

DONE.
