  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, while `peekLength() + 1` would return the length plus one, which could cause the `diff` method to skip over the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, while `peekLength() - 1` would return the length minus one, which could cause the `diff` method to include an extra operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, while `peekLength() * 2` would return the length
