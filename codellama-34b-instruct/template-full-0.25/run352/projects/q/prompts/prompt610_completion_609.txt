  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("get", [key + 1])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the property with the name `key + 1`, instead of the value of the property with the name `key`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("get", [key, value])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the property with the name `key`, but with the value `value` instead of the actual value of the property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("set", [key, value])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the property with the name `key` to `value`, instead of returning the value of the property.

DONE.
