  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 3 ? '-' : '') + c
```
This would result in different behavior because the modulo operator is now applied to 3 instead of 2, which would cause the code to produce different results for certain input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '+' : '') + c
```
This would result in different behavior because the minus sign is now flipped to a plus sign, which would cause the code to produce different results for certain input values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + (c * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the input value is now multiplied by 2, which would cause the code to produce different results for certain input values.

DONE.
