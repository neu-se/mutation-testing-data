  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.toLowerCase(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the word unchanged, while this replacement returns the word in lowercase.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + "es"; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment appends "s" to the end of the word, while this replacement appends "es" to the end of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.slice(0, -1); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the word unchanged, while this replacement returns the word without its final letter.

DONE.
