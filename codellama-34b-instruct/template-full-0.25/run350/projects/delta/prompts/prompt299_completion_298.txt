  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `line.length` would return the length of the `line` string, while `line` would return the string itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `line.toUpperCase()` would return the `line` string in uppercase, while `line` would return the string itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `line.split('')` would return an array of individual characters in the `line` string, while `line` would return the string itself.

DONE.
