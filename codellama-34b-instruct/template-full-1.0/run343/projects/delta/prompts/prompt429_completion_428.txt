  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return one less than the original `this.peekLength`, which could cause the iterator to miss the last element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return one less than the original `this.index`, which could cause the iterator to start at an incorrect position.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the length of the `ops` array, which could cause the iterator to iterate over the entire array, even if the `next` method has not been called.

DONE.
