  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `isInfinite()` method on the `this` object, which may not exist or may have a different implementation than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'] === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `isInfinite` property of the `this` object is strictly equal to the `true` value, which may not be the case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'] !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `isInfinite` property of the `this` object is not strictly equal to the `true` value, which may not be the case.

DONE.
