  DONE.

Here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is not followed by the line of code that pushes the node arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.splice(0, 1, deferred.makeNodeResolver())
```
This would result in different behavior because the splice method replaces the first element of the nodeArgs array with the result of the makeNodeResolver method, rather than adding it to the end of the array as in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver().call(null, nodeArgs)
```
This would result in different behavior because the call method is used to call the makeNodeResolver function with the nodeArgs array as its argument, rather than using the push method to add the result of the makeNodeResolver function to
