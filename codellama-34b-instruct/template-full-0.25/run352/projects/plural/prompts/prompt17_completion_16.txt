  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/x$|ch$|s$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is different, and the function is not the same.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/x$|ch$|s$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is the same, but the function is different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/x$|ch$|s$/i, function(w) { return w })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is the same, but the function is different and does not add any suffix to the word.

DONE.
