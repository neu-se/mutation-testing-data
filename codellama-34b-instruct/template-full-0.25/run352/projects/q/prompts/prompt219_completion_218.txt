  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, and the `if` statement would evaluate to `false`, causing the function to return `undefined` instead of a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, and the `if` statement would evaluate to `false`, causing the function to return `undefined` instead of a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a falsy value, and the `if` statement would evaluate to `false`, causing the function to return `undefined` instead of a promise.

DONE.
