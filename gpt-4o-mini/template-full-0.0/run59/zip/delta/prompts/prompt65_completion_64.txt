Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.push({ insert: NULL_CHARACTER });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert a NULL_CHARACTER instead of the intended new operation, potentially leading to incorrect state in the ops array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.push({ delete: 1 });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push a delete operation instead of the new operation, which could alter the intended sequence of operations and lead to data loss.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.push({ retain: 0 });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push a retain operation with a length of 0, which may not be meaningful and could lead to unexpected results in the processing of operations.

DONE.
