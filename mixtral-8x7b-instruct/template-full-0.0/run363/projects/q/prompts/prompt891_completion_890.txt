 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array would be passed as the last argument to `Q(callback).nfapply()`, which would cause the function to behave differently than with the original `args` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` would be passed as the last argument to `Q(callback).nfapply()`, which would cause the function to behave differently than with the original `args` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
123
```
This would result in different behavior because a number (in this case, `123`) would be passed as the last argument to `Q(callback).nfapply()`, which would cause the function to behave differently than with the original `args` variable.

DONE.
