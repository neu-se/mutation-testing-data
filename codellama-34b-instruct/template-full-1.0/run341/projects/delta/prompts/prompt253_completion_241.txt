  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the insert operation would be increased by one, which could cause the code to retain or delete extra characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the insert operation would be decreased by one, which could cause the code to retain or delete fewer characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length
```
This would result in different behavior because the length variable is not defined in the context of the code fragment, so the code would throw an error due to the undefined variable.

DONE.
