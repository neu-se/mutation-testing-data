  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `c`, which could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `c` is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c * 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply `c` by 0, which would always evaluate to `false` regardless of the value of `c`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the value of `c`, which could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `c` is not a number.

DONE.
