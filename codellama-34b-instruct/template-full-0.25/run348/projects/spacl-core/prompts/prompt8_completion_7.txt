  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` is a different method than `match`, and it would change the way the regular expression is applied to the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.replace
```
This would result in different behavior because `replace` is a different method than `match`, and it would change the way the regular expression is applied to the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split
```
This would result in different behavior because `split` is a different method than `match`, and it would change the way the regular expression is applied to the string.

DONE.
