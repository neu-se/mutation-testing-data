  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `null` instead of the next element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(array[i], null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the current element in the array instead of the next element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i++])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `null` instead of the current element in the array, and it would also increment `i` before returning.

DONE.
