  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function expects a string or cheerio object as the data parameter, and passing null would cause the function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because the function expects a string or cheerio object as the data parameter, and passing an empty string would cause the function to return an empty array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"<html><head></head><body></body></html>"
```
This would result in different behavior because the function expects a string or cheerio object as the data parameter, and passing a valid HTML string would cause the function to return an array of URLs found in the HTML document.

DONE.
