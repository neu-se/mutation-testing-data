  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because `res !== false` is always true when `res` is `null`, which is the initial value of `allow`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because `res !== true` is always true when `res` is `null`, which is the initial value of `allow`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allow === true
```
This would result in different behavior because `allow` is initially `null`, and `null` is not equal to `true`.

DONE.
