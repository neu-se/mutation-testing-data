  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr("href")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attr` method is used to get the value of an attribute, whereas the original code fragment uses the `attr` method to set the value of an attribute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).prop("href")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `prop` method is used to get the value of a property, whereas the original code fragment uses the `attr` method to set the value of an attribute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).data("href")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `data` method is used to get the value of a data attribute, whereas the original code fragment uses the `attr` method to set the value of an attribute.

DONE.
