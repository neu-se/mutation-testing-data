  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would change the value of `op`, which is used in the `dispatch` function to determine the property to access on the `object`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would change the value of `op`, which is used in the `dispatch` function to determine the property to access on the `object`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would change the value of `op`, which is used in the `dispatch` function to determine the property to access on the `object`.

DONE.
