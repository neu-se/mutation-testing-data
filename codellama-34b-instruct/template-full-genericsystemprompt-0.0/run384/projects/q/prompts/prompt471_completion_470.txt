  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled", unhandledReasons[at], unhandledRejections[at]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit the `rejectionHandled` event with the reason and the rejection, instead of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled", unhandledReasons[at], reportedUnhandledRejections[at]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit the `rejectionHandled` event with the reason and the reported unhandled rejection, instead of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled", unhandledReasons[at], unhandledReasons[at]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit the `rejectionHandled` event with the reason and the reason, instead of the promise.

DONE.
