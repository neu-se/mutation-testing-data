  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback(error, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only passes the error to the nodeback, while this modified code fragment passes both the error and null as arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback(null, error)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the error as the first argument to the nodeback, while this modified code fragment passes null as the first argument and the error as the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback(error, error)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only passes one argument to the nodeback, while this modified code fragment passes two identical arguments.

DONE.
