  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is expected to be a function, but `null` is not a function and will cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is expected to be a function, but `undefined` is not a function and will cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { throw new Error(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is expected to be a function that takes no arguments and returns a value, but the replacement code fragment is a function that takes no arguments and throws an error.

DONE.
