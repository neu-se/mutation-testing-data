  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `φ1` and `φ2` are different variables representing the latitude of two different points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `λ1` and `φ2` are different variables representing the longitude of two different points.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2
```
This would result in different behavior because `λ2` and `φ2` are different variables representing the longitude of two different points.

DONE.
