  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw Error('Something went wrong.');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would attempt to re-throw the error in the `isNodeJS` case, while the modified code would instead throw a new `Error` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would continue executing the function, while the modified code would return early.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log('Error:', e);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would re-throw the error, while the modified code would log the error message to the console.

DONE.
