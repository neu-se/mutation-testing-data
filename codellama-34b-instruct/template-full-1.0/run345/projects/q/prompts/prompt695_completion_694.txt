  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function() { return null; })();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is expected to return a value, while the replaced code fragment returns null, which could cause unexpected behavior in the surrounding code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function() { return Math.random(); })();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the same value every time it is called, while the replaced code fragment returns a random value each time it is called, which could cause non-deterministic behavior in the surrounding code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function() { throw new Error("Intentional error"); })();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not throw any errors, while the replaced code fragment throws an error, which could cause the surrounding code to handle errors in unexpected ways.

DONE.
