  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushes an operation to the delta, while the replaced code fragment pushes null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushes an operation to the delta, while the replaced code fragment pushes undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushes an operation to the delta, while the replaced code fragment pushes a new operation.

DONE.
