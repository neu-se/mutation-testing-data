 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
delta.push('');
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes an empty string into the delta instead of the 'otherOp' object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
delta.push(otherOp.delete);
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes the 'delete' property of 'otherOp' into the delta instead of the entire 'otherOp' object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
delta.push(otherOp.insert);
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes the 'insert' property of 'otherOp' into the delta instead of the entire 'otherOp' object.

DONE.
