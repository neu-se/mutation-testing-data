  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the truthiness of `data`, which would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` and the `cb` function to always be called with `end` set to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add 1 to the value of `data`, which would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false` and the `cb` function to never be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of `data` would always be 0, which would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false` and the `cb` function to never be called.

DONE.
