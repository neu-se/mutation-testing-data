  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1 + λ2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the longitude values of the two points instead of subtracting them, which would result in a different destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1 - λ2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the longitude values of the two points instead of adding them, which would result in a different destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1 * λ2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the longitude values of the two points instead of subtracting them, which would result in a different destination point.

DONE.
