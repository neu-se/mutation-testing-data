 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
predicate(line, {}, i) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attributes` object is not passed to the `predicate` function, which might cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
predicate(line, iter.peek().attributes || {}, i) === false
