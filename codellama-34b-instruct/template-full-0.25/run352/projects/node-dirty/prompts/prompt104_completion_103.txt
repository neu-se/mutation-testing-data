  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete(row.key);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` method would remove the key-value pair from the database, whereas the original code fragment would update the value associated with the key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(row.key, undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would update the value associated with the key to `undefined`, whereas the original code fragment would remove the key-value pair from the database.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(row.key, row.val);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would update the value associated with the key to `row.val`, whereas the original code fragment would remove the key-value pair from the database.

DONE.
