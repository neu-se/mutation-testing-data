  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the variable `a`, whereas the original code fragment only negates the imaginary part of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a+1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the variable `a`, whereas the original code fragment only negates the imaginary part of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the variable `b` instead of `a`, whereas the original code fragment only uses the imaginary part of the complex number.

DONE.
