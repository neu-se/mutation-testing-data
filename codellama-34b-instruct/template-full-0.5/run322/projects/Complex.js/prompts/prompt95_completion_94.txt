  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would be applied to the complex number `c` with the value `1`, resulting in a different complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator would be applied to the complex number `c` with the value `1`, resulting in a different complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would be applied to the complex number `c` with the value `2`, resulting in a different complex number.

DONE.
