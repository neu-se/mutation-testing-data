  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` method will return a shallow copy of a portion of the original array, whereas `reduce` method will return a single value derived from the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.filter()
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` method will return a new array with the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, whereas `reduce` method will return a single value derived from the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.forEach()
```
This would result in different behavior because `forEach` method will execute the provided function once for each element in the array, whereas `reduce` method will return a single value derived from the original array.

DONE.
