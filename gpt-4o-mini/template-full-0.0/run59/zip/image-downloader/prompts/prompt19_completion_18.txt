Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isAbsolute(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the code to proceed when `options.dest` is an absolute path, which is the opposite of the original intent to only resolve relative paths.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `options.dest` is an empty string, which would not account for other invalid path scenarios, potentially leading to unexpected behavior when a valid but non-empty relative path is provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!options.dest.startsWith('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `options.dest` does not start with a forward slash, which would incorrectly treat relative paths as absolute paths, leading to incorrect resolution of the destination.

DONE.
