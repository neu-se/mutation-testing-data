  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject, op, args
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method would be called instead of the `resolve` method, causing the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify, op, args
```
This would result in different behavior because the `notify` method would be called instead of the `resolve` method, causing the promise to be notified instead of resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolveWith, op, args
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolveWith` method would be called instead of the `resolve` method, causing the promise to be resolved with a different context instead of the original context.

DONE.
