  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring method would return a different string than `data`, which could cause the `JSON.parse` method to throw a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase` method would return a different string than `data`, which could cause the `JSON.parse` method to throw a syntax error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would concatenate the string `'foo'` to `data`, which could cause the `JSON.parse` method to throw a syntax error.

DONE.
