  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"!="
```
This would result in different behavior because the `search` property of the `parsedUrl` object would not be set to `null` when the `search` query parameter is not present in the URL, which could cause the `querycount` property to be calculated incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"%"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `search` property of the `parsedUrl` object would be set to the remainder of the URL after the `search` query parameter, which could cause the `querycount` property to be calculated incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"&"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `search` property of the `parsedUrl` object would be set to the concatenation of the `search` query parameter and the ampersand character, which could cause the `querycount` property to be calculated incorrectly.

DONE.
