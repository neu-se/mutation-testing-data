  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason.message
```
This would result in different behavior because `reason.message` is a string, whereas `reason` is an object with a `message` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because `reason.stack` is a string, whereas `reason` is an object with a `stack` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason.name
```
This would result in different behavior because `reason.name` is a string, whereas `reason` is an object with a `name` property.

DONE.
