  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite'](this['re'])
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['re']` is not the same as `this['im']`, which is what the original code fragment is checking.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite'](this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['im']` is not the same as `this['re']`, which is what the original code fragment is checking.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite'](this['re'] + this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['re'] + this['im']` is not the same as `this['re']`, which is what the original code fragment is checking.

DONE.
