  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the `newOp` object onto the `ops` array, which is not what the original code does. The original code returns a new `Delta` object with the `newOp` object pushed onto the `ops` array.
