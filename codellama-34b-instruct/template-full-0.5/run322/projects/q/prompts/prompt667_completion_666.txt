  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first argument and start from the second one, which could cause unexpected results if the function is not designed to handle this behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only take the first argument and ignore the rest, which could cause unexpected results if the function is not designed to handle this behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the number of arguments passed to the function, which could cause unexpected results if the function is not designed to handle this behavior.

DONE.
