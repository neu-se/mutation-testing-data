  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
latitude < -90 || latitude > 90 || latitude === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional condition `latitude === 0` would cause the constructor to throw an error for a valid input of `latitude = 0`, even though the original code fragment would not have thrown an error for this input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
latitude < -90 || latitude > 90 || latitude > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional condition `latitude > 0` would cause the constructor to throw an error for a valid input of `latitude = 0`, even though the original code fragment would not have thrown an error for this input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
latitude < -90 || latitude > 90 || latitude < -100
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional condition `latitude < -100` would cause the constructor
