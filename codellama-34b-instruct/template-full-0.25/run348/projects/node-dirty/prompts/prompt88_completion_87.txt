  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.pop(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `buffer.pop(<PLACEHOLDER>)` is using the `pop()` method to remove and return the last element of the `buffer` array, while the new code fragment `buffer.pop(1)` is using the `pop()` method to remove and return the first element of the `buffer` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.shift(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `buffer.pop(<PLACEHOLDER>)` is using the `pop()` method to remove and return the last element of the `buffer` array, while the new code fragment `buffer.shift(1)` is using the `shift()` method to remove and return the first element of the `buffer` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.splice(1, 1);
```
This would result in
