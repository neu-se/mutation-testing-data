  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'<a href="#">'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the hash symbol with an empty string, while this code fragment would replace it with a link to the current page.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'<script>alert("XSS")</script>'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not allow for the execution of JavaScript code, while this code fragment would execute the JavaScript code and display an alert box with the message "XSS".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'<img src="x" onerror="alert(1)">'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not allow for the execution of JavaScript code, while this code fragment would execute the JavaScript code in the onerror event handler and display an alert box with the message "1".

DONE.
