  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` and `apply` are different methods of the `Function` object, and they have different behaviors when it comes to the `this` context and the arguments passed to the function. In this case, `apply` is used to call the `callback` function with the `thisp` object as the `this` context and the `nodeArgs` array as the arguments, while `call` would call the `callback` function with the `thisp` object as the `this` context and the `nodeArgs` array elements as the arguments.

DONE.
