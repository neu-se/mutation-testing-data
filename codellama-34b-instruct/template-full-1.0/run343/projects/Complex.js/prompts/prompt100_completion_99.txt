  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '+' : '-') + c
```
This would result in different behavior because the operator used in the ternary expression is swapped from subtraction to addition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '*' : '/') + c
```
This would result in different behavior because the operator used in the ternary expression is swapped from subtraction to multiplication.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '**' : '//') + c
```
This would result in different behavior because the operator used in the ternary expression is swapped from subtraction to exponentiation.

DONE.
