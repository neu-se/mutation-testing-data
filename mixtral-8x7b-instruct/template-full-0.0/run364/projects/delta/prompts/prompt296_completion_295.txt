 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the line detection logic would be affected, potentially causing incorrect line handling in the `eachLine` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-index
```
This would result in different behavior because the line detection logic would be affected, potentially causing incorrect line handling in the `eachLine` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the type check for the `index` variable would fail, causing a runtime error in the `eachLine` method.

DONE.
