  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allResolved` function expects the input array to be in the same order as the original promises, but `reverse()` would change the order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allResolved` function expects the input array to contain all the promises, but `slice(1)` would remove the first promise from the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.concat(Q.reject())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allResolved` function expects the input array to contain only resolved or rejected promises, but `concat(Q.reject())` would add an additional rejected promise to the array.

DONE.
