  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the result of the `isNaN` method, causing the `isInfinite` method to return `true` when the number is not infinite, and `false` when the number is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite` method checks if the number is finite, whereas the `isInfinite` method checks if the number is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method checks if the number is infinite, whereas the `isFinite` method checks if the number is finite.

DONE.
