  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checks if `end` is false, while the new code checks if `end` is false or if `a` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `end` is false, while the new code checks if `a` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `end` is false, while the new code checks if `a` is truthy.

DONE.
