 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Function.prototype.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defineProperty` method is being replaced with `bind`, which is used to create a new function with the `this` value set to a specified object and partially applied arguments. In this case, it would not define any properties on the `Complex` object, and the `Complex` object would not have the expected properties such as `ZERO`, `ONE`, `I`, `PI`, `E`, `INFINITY`, `NAN`, and `EPSILON`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sqrt
