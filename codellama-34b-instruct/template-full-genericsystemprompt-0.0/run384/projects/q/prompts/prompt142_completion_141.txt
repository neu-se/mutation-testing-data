  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise; !p; p = p.source
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!p` operator would always return `true`, regardless of the value of `p`, causing the loop to run indefinitely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise; p.source; p = p.source
```
This would result in different behavior because the `p.source` property would always be `undefined`, causing the loop to run indefinitely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise; p.source; p = p.source.source
```
This would result in different behavior because the `p.source.source` property would always be `undefined`, causing the loop to run indefinitely.

DONE.
