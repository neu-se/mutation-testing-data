 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.exit()
```
This would result in different behavior because the process would be terminated immediately, not allowing the function to continue executing and possibly causing the test to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to start processing the next stream without checking if there's an error in the current stream. This might cause the function to skip processing some data or continue processing even if there's an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
while (true) {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an infinite loop, preventing the function from continuing its execution and causing the test to fail due to a timeout or resource exhaustion.

DONE.
