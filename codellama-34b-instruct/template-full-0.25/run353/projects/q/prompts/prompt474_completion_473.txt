  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would remove one element from the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, instead of the expected `atReport` element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would remove zero elements from the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, instead of the expected `atReport` element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would remove 10 elements from the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, instead of the expected `atReport` element.

DONE.
