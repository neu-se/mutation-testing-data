  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return a different array of strings, with the first element removed. This would cause the `compile` function to produce a different regular expression and list of properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(0, -1)
```
This would also result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return a different array of strings, with the last element removed. Again, this would cause the `compile` function to produce a different regular expression and list of properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').splice(-2, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would remove the last two elements from the array, rather than the first two. This would cause the `compile` function to produce a different regular expression and list of properties.

DONE.
