  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basename.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `basename` variable as is, while the modified code fragment uses the `toLowerCase()` method to convert the `basename` to lowercase. This could cause the `path.join()` method to produce a different output, which could in turn affect the behavior of the `request()` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename(pathname).toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `basename` variable as is, while the modified code fragment uses the `toUpperCase()` method to convert the `basename` to uppercase. This could cause the `path.join()` method to produce a different output, which could in turn affect the behavior of the `request()` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(pathname)
```
This would result in different behavior
