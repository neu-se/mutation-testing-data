  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^\//) === true
```
This change will cause the `Matcher` constructor to throw an error when the `spec` argument does not start with a forward slash, even if it is a valid path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^\//) === false
```
This change will cause the `Matcher` constructor to throw an error when the `spec` argument starts with a forward slash, even if it is a valid path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^\//) === null
```
This change will cause the `Matcher` constructor to throw an error when the `spec` argument does not start with a forward slash, even if it is a valid path.

DONE.
