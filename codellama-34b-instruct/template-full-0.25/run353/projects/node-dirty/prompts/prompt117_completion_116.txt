  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('read_close', 'extra argument');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits the 'read_close' event with no arguments, while this code emits the event with an extra argument, which may cause the event listener to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('write_close', 'extra argument');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits the 'write_close' event with no arguments, while this code emits the event with an extra argument, which may cause the event listener to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', 'extra argument');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits the 'drain' event with no arguments, while this code emits the event with an extra argument, which may cause the event listener to behave differently.

DONE.
