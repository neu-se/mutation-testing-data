  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(aborted)
```
This would result in different behavior because `abortCb` is a function that takes an `aborted` argument, but in the original code, it is not called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a special value that indicates the end of a sequence, but in the original code, it is not used in this context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a special value that indicates an uninitialized variable, but in the original code, it is not used in this context.

DONE.
