 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
(<any>this).get
```
This would result in different behavior because it bypasses TypeScript's type checking and allows any key to be used with the `get` method, potentially causing a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.get.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the value of `this` inside the `get` method, potentially causing unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
(name: any) => this.get(name)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new arrow function that ignores its arguments and always returns `this.get(name)`, potentially causing unexpected behavior or errors.

DONE.
