  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This change will cause the `map` function to iterate over the values of the `array` object, rather than its keys. This could potentially cause the `values` function to return a different set of values than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This change will cause the `map` function to iterate over the key-value pairs of the `array` object, rather than its keys. This could potentially cause the `values` function to return a different set of values than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys.length
```
This change will cause the `map` function to iterate over the length of the `array` object, rather than its keys. This could potentially cause the `values` function to return a different set of values than the original code.

DONE.
