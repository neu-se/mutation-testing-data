  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.promiseDispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `self.promiseDispatch` is a function that would be called with the current value of `op`, which could lead to a different execution path than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.promiseDispatch(resolve)
```
This would result in different behavior because `self.promiseDispatch` would be called with the current value of `resolve`, which could lead to a different execution path than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.promiseDispatch("when", [resolve])
```
This would result in different behavior because `self.promiseDispatch` would be called with the current value of `resolve` as an argument, which could lead to a different execution path than the original code.

DONE.
