  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if `process` is an object and then calling `toString` on it, while the new code fragment is calling `toString` on the result of `process.toString()`, which is a string and does not have a `toString` method.
