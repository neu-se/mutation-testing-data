 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
(<any>super)[Symbol.match]
```
This would result in different behavior because it bypasses TypeScript's type checking, allowing any property to be accessed on the super object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.getPrototypeOf(this)[Symbol.match]
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `Object.getPrototypeOf()` to access the prototype of the current object, which might not always reference the super object if the prototype chain is modified.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Reflect.getPrototypeOf(this)[Symbol.match]
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `Reflect.getPrototypeOf()` to access the prototype of the current object, which might not always reference the super object if the prototype chain is modified.

DONE.
