  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rest().concat
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `concat` method on the `rest` method return value, instead of the `next` method return value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rest().slice
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `slice` method on the `rest` method return value, instead of the `next` method return value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rest()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `rest` method return value directly, without calling any methods on it.

DONE.
