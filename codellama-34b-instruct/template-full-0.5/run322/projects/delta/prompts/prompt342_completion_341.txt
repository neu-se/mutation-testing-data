  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return {};
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return an empty object, rather than the expected embed type and data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return null, rather than the expected embed type and data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return 'foo';
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the string 'foo', rather than the expected embed type and data.

DONE.
