  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b >= 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `>=` operator has a different truth table than the `>` operator, which could cause the `if` statement to behave differently for certain inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator has a different result when the operands have the same sign than when they have different signs, which could cause the `if` statement to behave differently for certain inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a == b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `==` operator checks for equality, whereas the `<` operator checks for less than, which could cause the `if` statement to behave differently for certain inputs.

DONE.
