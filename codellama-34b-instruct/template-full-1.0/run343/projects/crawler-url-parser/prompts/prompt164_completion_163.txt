  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` checks whether `linkurl_path` contains `pageurl_path` as a substring, whereas `includes` checks whether `linkurl_path` contains `pageurl_path` as a comparison.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.match
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` performs a pattern match on `linkurl_path`, whereas `includes` performs a string comparison.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.slice(0, pageurl_path.length) === pageurl_path
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` extracts a substring of `linkurl_path` starting from index 0 with a length equal to `pageurl_path.length`, and then checks whether this substring is equal to `pageurl_path`.

DONE.
