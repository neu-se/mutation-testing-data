  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for 2 arguments, while this replacement checks for only 1 argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length === 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for 2 arguments, while this replacement checks for 3 arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.legnth === 4
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for 2 arguments, while this replacement checks for 4 arguments.

DONE.
