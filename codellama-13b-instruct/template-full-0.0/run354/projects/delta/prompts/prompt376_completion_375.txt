  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be inverted, causing the code to execute the `delta.push(otherIter.next());` line when the `otherIter` is not an insert operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be inverted, causing the code to execute the `delta.push(otherIter.next());` line when the `otherIter` is a delete operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be inverted, causing the code to execute the `delta.push(otherIter.next());` line when the `otherIter` is a retain operation.

DONE.
