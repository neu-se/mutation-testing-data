  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream || targetFilePath
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would cause the `targetFilePath` to be used as the output stream even if a custom write stream is provided in the `zipAFolderOptions`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream && !targetFilePath
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would cause the `targetFilePath` to be ignored even if it is provided in the `zipAFolderOptions`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream ?? targetFilePath
```
This would result in different behavior because the `??` operator would cause the `targetFilePath` to be used as the output stream if a custom write stream is not provided in the `zipAFolderOptions`.

DONE.
