  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r - a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has a typo, and the correct formula should be `2.0 * (r + a)`. The buggy code fragment would cause the `sqrt` method to return incorrect results for certain input values.

DONE.
