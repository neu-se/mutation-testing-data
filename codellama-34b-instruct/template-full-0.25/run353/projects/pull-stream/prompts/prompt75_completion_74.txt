  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done || function () { throw new Error('aborted') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would call the `done` callback with a value of `true` if the stream was aborted, while the new code fragment would throw an error instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done || function () { return null }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would call the `done` callback with a value of `true` if the stream was aborted, while the new code fragment would return `null` instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done || function () { return undefined }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would call the `done` callback with a value of `true` if the stream was aborted, while the new code fragment would return `undefined` instead.

DONE.
