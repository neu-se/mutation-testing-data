  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `self.length` would return the length of the array, whereas `self` would return the array itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `self[0]` would return the first element of the array, whereas `self` would return the array itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `self.pop()` would remove and return the last element of the array, whereas `self` would return the array itself.

DONE.
