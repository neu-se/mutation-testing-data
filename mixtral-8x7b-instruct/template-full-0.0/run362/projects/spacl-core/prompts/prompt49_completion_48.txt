 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'1'
```
This would result in different behavior because it always adds a literal '1' to the props array instead of extracting the captured group from the regex.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a random float number to the props array instead of extracting the captured group from the regex.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Date().getTime()
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the current timestamp as a number to the props array instead of extracting the captured group from the regex.

DONE.
