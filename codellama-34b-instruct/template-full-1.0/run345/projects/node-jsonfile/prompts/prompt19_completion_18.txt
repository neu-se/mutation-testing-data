  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the spread operator will return a new array with the same elements as the original array, but with the first element removed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` will remove and return the last element of the array, rather than the first element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift()` will remove and return the first element of the array, rather than the last element.

DONE.
