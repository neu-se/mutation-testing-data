  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value[name]()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is not called, which means that the function will not be invoked with the specified context and arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value[name].call
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method is not called, which means that the function will not be invoked with the specified context and arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value[name].bind
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method is not called, which means that the function will not be bound to the specified context and arguments.

DONE.
