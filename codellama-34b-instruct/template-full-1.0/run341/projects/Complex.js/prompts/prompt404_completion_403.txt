  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `x['im']` returns the imaginary part of the complex number, while the replaced code fragment `x['re']` returns the real part of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1*x['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `x['im']` returns the imaginary part of the complex number, while the replaced code fragment `-1*x['im']` returns the negative of the imaginary part of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x['re']*x['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `x['im']` returns the imaginary part of the complex number, while the replaced code fragment `x['re']*x['im']` returns the product of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number.
