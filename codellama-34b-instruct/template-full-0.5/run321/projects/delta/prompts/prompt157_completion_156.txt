  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the next operation is an insert, while this code checks if the next operation has a non-zero length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the next operation is an insert, while this code checks if the next operation has a zero length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the next operation is an insert, while this code checks if the next operation is a retain.

DONE.
