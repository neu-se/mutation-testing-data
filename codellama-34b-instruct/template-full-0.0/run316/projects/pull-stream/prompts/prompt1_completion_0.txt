  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only iterate once, since `k` would be initialized to 0 and never change.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k = sources.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate in reverse order, since `k` would be initialized to the last index of the `sources` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k = Math.floor(Math.random() * sources.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate in a random order, since `k` would be initialized to a random index of the `sources` array.

DONE.
