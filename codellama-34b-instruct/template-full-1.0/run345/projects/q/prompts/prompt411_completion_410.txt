  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `value` is an instance of `Promise`, while this modified code always returns `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `value` is an instance of `Promise`, while this modified code always returns `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof value === "number"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `value` is an instance of `Promise`, while this modified code checks if `value` is a number.

DONE.
