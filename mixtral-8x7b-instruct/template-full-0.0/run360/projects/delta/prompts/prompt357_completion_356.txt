 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `transformPosition` method would always start transforming at the beginning of the delta, regardless of the provided index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the `transformPosition` method would always skip the first operation when transforming, regardless of the provided index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `transformPosition` method would always transform the first deletion or insertion operation, even if the provided index is greater than the length of the delta.

DONE.
