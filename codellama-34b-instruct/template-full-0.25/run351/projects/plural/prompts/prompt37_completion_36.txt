  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/appendix|index/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'es' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `addRule` function to add a rule for words that end in "ices," but the modified code fragment uses the `addRule` function to add a rule for words that end in "es."

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/appendix|index/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ices' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `addRule` function to add a rule for words that end in "es," but the modified code fragment uses the `addRule` function to add a rule for words that end in "ices."
