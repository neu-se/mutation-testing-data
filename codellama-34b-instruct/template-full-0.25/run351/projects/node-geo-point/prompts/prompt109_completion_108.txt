  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(2, zoom) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.pow()` function to calculate the power of 2, but this code fragment adds 1 to the result, which would cause the calculation to be off by 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(2, zoom - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.pow()` function to calculate the power of 2, but this code fragment subtracts 1 from the zoom level before calculating the power, which would cause the calculation to be off by a factor of 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(2, zoom) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.pow()` function to calculate the power of 2, but this code fragment multiplies the result by 2, which
