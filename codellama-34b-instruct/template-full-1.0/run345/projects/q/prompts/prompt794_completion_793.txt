  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` function would never be called if the promise is fulfilled, whereas with the original implementation, the `progressed` function is called with `undefined` if the promise is fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` function would be called with `undefined` if the promise is fulfilled, whereas with the original implementation, the `progressed` function is not called if the promise is fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify` function would be called with `undefined` if the promise is fulfilled, whereas with the original implementation, the `progressed` function is not called if the promise is fulfilled.

DONE.
