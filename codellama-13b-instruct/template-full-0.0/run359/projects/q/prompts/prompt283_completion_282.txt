  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is now being accessed with an index of 2, which is out of bounds for the array. This would cause the code to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is now being accessed with an index of 0, which is the first element of the array. This would cause the code to return the first element of the array, rather than the second element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is now being accessed with an index of 3, which is out of bounds for the array. This would cause the code to throw an error.

DONE.
