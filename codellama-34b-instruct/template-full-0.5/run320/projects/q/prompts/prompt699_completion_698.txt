  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be called with the wrong number of arguments, which could cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be called with too many arguments, which could cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be called with a null value for the `this` context, which could cause an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
