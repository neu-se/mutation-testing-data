  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.indexOf("(module.js:") !== -1 ||
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the string "module.js:" is present in the line, which is not the same as checking if the line starts with "at ".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.indexOf("(node.js:") !== -1 ||
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the string "node.js:" is present in the line, which is not the same as checking if the line starts with "at ".
