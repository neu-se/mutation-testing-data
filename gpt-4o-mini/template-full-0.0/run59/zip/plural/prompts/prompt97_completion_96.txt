Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'i') }
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the vowel replacement from 'a' to 'i', which would incorrectly pluralize "woman" to "womin" instead of "women".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends 's' to the word instead of applying the correct pluralization rule, resulting in "woman" becoming "womans" instead of "women".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/man/, 'men') }
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly replaces "man" with "men" without considering the context of the word, which could lead to incorrect pluralization for words like "woman".

DONE.
