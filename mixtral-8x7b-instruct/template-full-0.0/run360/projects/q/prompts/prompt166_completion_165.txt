 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because it decrements the loop variable instead of incrementing it, which would change the order of iterating over the array and might not visit all elements or even cause an infinite loop in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it always increments the loop variable by 2, effectively skipping every other element in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it generates a random number instead of incrementing the loop variable, which would cause the loop to terminate prematurely or not at all, depending on the generated number.

DONE.
