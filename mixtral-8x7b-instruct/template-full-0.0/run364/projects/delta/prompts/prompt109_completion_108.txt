 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
index < start
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the current operation to the `passed` array even if the index is within the `start` and `end` range.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
index >= end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the current operation to the `failed` array even if the index is still within the `end` range.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
index === start
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the current operation to the `failed` array when the index is exactly equal to `start`, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
