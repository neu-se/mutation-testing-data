  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect !== void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` function would be called, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` function would not be called, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` function would not be called, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
