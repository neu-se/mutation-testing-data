  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that is not a function, so it would cause a runtime error when the promise is rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that is not a function, so it would cause a runtime error when the promise is rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `() => {}` is a function that returns `undefined`, so it would not cause a runtime error when the promise is rejected. However, it would also not provide any useful information about the rejection.

DONE.
