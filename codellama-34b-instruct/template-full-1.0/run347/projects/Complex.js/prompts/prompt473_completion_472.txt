  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'isNaN' and 'isInfinite' methods would no longer be checking the real part of the number, but instead the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'a' object could have a different real part than the current object, which would affect the outcome of the 'isNaN' and 'isInfinite' methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex['INFINITY']['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'INFINITY' constant has a different real part than the current object, which would affect the outcome of the 'isNaN' and 'isInfinite' methods.

DONE.
