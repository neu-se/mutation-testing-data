  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx++
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx++` increments the value of `ctx`, while `ctx` itself is a pass-by-value parameter and does not modify the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because `!ctx` negates the value of `ctx`, while `ctx` itself is a pass-by-value parameter and does not modify the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx + 1` adds 1 to the value of `ctx`, while `ctx` itself is a pass-by-value parameter and does not modify the original value.

DONE.
