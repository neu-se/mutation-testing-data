  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because the `im` property is the imaginary part of the complex number, and multiplying it by `places` would result in a different value than multiplying the `re` property by `places`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * places + this['im'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the imaginary part of the complex number to the real part, resulting in a different value than just multiplying the real part by `places`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * places - this['im'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the imaginary part of the complex number from the real part, resulting in a different value than just multiplying the real part by `places`.

DONE.
