  Sure, I can help you with that!

After reviewing the code, I have identified three potential mutants that could be used to test the test suite of the provided code. The mutants are highlighted in the code block below, along with a brief explanation of the expected behavior change for each mutant.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(value) {
  return reject(value);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would no longer return a resolved promise, but rather a rejected one with the same value as the original promise. This would change the outcome of any dependent promises, and the test suite should catch this behavior change.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(value) {
  throw new Error('Test error');
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would throw an error, causing the promise chain to fail. The test suite should catch this behavior change and ensure that the promise chain handles errors correctly.
