  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof StopIteration !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `StopIteration` is undefined, while this new code fragment checks if it is defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
StopIteration !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `StopIteration` is undefined, while this new code fragment checks if it is not equal to `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
StopIteration !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `StopIteration` is undefined, while this new code fragment checks if it is not equal to `null`.

DONE.
