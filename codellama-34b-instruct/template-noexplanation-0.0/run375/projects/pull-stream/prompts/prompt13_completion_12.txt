  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This change will cause the loop to decrement the value of `i` instead of incrementing it, which will result in an infinite loop if the length of `arguments` is greater than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This change will cause the loop to increment the value of `i` by 2 instead of 1, which will result in the loop skipping over every other element in the `arguments` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = length - 1
```
This change will cause the loop to start at the last element of the `arguments` array instead of the first element, which will result in the loop iterating over the elements in reverse order.

DONE.
