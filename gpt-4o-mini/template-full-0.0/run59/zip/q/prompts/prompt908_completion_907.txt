Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to ignore any arguments passed to it, resulting in an empty array being used instead of the actual arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would lead to the function attempting to concatenate `null` with the other arguments, which would not work as intended and could lead to unexpected results or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to use the context of the current object instead of the arguments passed, potentially leading to incorrect behavior if the function relies on the provided arguments.

DONE.
