  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo", [name, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` argument would be `"foo"` instead of `"post"`, which would likely cause the `dispatch` method to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get", [name, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` argument would be `"get"` instead of `"post"`, which would likely cause the `dispatch` method to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [name, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` argument would be `"set"` instead of `"post"`, which would likely cause the `dispatch` method to fail.

DONE.
