 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Function.prototype.bind.call(deferred.resolve, deferred)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately call `deferred.resolve` with the `nodeArgs` array as an argument, instead of waiting for the Node.js-style callback to be called and passing the result to `deferred.resolve`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always resolve the promise with the value `deferred.promise`, instead of waiting for the Node.js-style callback to be called and passing the result to `deferred.resolve`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always reject the promise with no reason, instead of waiting for the Node.js-style callback to be called and passing the result to `deferred.resolve` or `deferred.reject
