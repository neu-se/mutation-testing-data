  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with the `this` context set to `null`, which would cause the `test.test` function to be called with the wrong context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` calls the `test.test` function with the `this` context set to `null`, which would cause the function to be called with the wrong context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` calls the `test.test` function with the `this` context set to `null`, which would cause the function to be called with the wrong context.

DONE.
