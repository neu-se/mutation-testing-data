  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush(true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `true` argument passed to `_flush` would cause the method to always flush the queue, even if the queue is not full. This could lead to unnecessary writes to the database and potentially cause performance issues.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush(false);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` argument passed to `_flush` would cause the method to never flush the queue, even if the queue is full. This could lead to data loss if the queue is not emptied before the program exits.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush(this._queue.size > 100);
```
This would result in different behavior because the method would only flush the queue if the queue size is greater than 100. This could lead to data loss if the queue size is not properly maintained.

DONE.
