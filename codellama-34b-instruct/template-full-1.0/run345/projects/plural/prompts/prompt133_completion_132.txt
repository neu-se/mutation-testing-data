  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the test case would be checking the rule's replacement value, not the rule itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the test case would be checking the length of the rule, not the rule itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type(rule)
```
This would result in different behavior because the test case would be checking the rule's type, not the rule itself.

DONE.
