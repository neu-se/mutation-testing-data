  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would reject the promise when the original code fragment would have rejected it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw new Error()` would cause the promise to be rejected when the original code fragment would have resolved it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log()
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.log()` would not affect the promise at all, so it would be resolved in both cases.

DONE.
