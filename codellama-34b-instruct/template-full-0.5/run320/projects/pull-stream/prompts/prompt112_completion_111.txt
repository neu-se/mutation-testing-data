  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc + data
```
This would result in different behavior because `acc + data` would always return a new value, whereas `acc, data` would return the original `acc` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc * data
```
This would result in different behavior because `acc * data` would return a different value than `acc, data`, even if `data` is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc - data
```
This would result in different behavior because `acc - data` would return a different value than `acc, data`, even if `data` is zero.

DONE.
