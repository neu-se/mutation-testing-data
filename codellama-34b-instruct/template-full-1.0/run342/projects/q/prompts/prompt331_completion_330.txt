  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return resolve(resolved);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved twice, which is not allowed and would lead to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected, which would affect the behavior of the code that handles the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return void 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with no value, which would affect the behavior of the code that handles the promise.

DONE.
