  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of the values of the object's own properties, whereas `Object.keys` returns an array of the object's own property names.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries` returns an array of the object's own property name/value pairs, whereas `Object.keys` returns an array of the object's own property names.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.getOwnPropertyNames
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.getOwnPropertyNames` returns an array of the object's own property names, whereas `Object.keys` returns an array of the object's own property names that are enumerable.

DONE.
