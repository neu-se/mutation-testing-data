  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num !== 1 || num === false
```
This would result in different behavior because `num === undefined` would no longer be a valid condition for using the default pluralization algorithm.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num !== 1 || num !== 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `num === 1` would no longer be a valid condition for using the default pluralization algorithm.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num !== 1 || NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is not equal to any number, including `num === 1`, so the default pluralization algorithm would always be used.

DONE.
