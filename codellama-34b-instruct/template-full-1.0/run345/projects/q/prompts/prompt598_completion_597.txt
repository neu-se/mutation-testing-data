  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because now the operation is being performed on the next value in the sequence, instead of the current value. This could cause the code to behave unexpectedly, especially if the operation is not commutative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because now the operation is being performed on the previous value in the sequence, instead of the current value. This could cause the code to behave unexpectedly, especially if the operation is not commutative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * op
```
This would result in different behavior because now the operation is being performed on twice the current value, instead of just the current value. This could cause the code to behave unexpectedly, especially if the operation is not associative.

DONE.
