  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.slice.call(this, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `Array.prototype.slice` with the `this` context, which would not be the same as calling `Array.prototype.slice` directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.slice.call(this, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `Array.prototype.slice` with the `this` context and a different argument, which would result in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.slice.call(this, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `Array.prototype.slice` with the `this` context and a different argument, which would result in a different output.

DONE.
