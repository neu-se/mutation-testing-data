  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `window` is defined, while the replacement code fragment checks if it is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `window` is defined, while the replacement code fragment checks if `process` is defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof self !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `window` is defined, while the replacement code fragment checks if `self` is defined.

DONE.
