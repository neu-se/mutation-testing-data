  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `output` variable is a writable stream, and writing to a null stream would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `output` variable is a writable stream, and writing to an undefined stream would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.pipe(fs.createWriteStream(targetFilePath))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new writable stream for the `targetFilePath` and write the output to that stream, instead of writing to the existing `output` stream.

DONE.
