```
zipArchive.file
```
This would result in different behavior because `zipArchive.file` is used to add a file to the archive, whereas `zipArchive.directory` is used to add a directory to the archive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.directory(src, { name: 'new_name' })
```
This would result in different behavior because `zipArchive.directory` is used to add a directory to the archive with a new name, whereas `zipArchive.directory(src)` is used to add a directory to the archive with the same name as the source directory.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.directory(src, { ignoreBase: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because `zipArchive.directory` is used to add a directory to the archive, ignoring the base directory, whereas `zipArchive.directory(src)` is used to add a directory to the
