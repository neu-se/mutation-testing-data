  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("delete", [key]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` operation would be performed on the `object` instead of the `key`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("set", [key, value]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` operation would be performed on the `object` instead of the `key`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("get", [key]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` operation would be performed on the `object` instead of the `key`.

DONE.
