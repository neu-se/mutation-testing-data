Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the index by 1 after processing the last line, potentially causing the predicate to be called with an incorrect index value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the index value, which could lead to incorrect line indexing when the predicate is called, affecting the logic that relies on the index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reset the index to 0 every time the predicate is called, which would not reflect the actual number of lines processed and could lead to incorrect behavior in the predicate function.

DONE.
