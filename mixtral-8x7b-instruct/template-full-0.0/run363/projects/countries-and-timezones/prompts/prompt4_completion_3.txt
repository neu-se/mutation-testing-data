 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezonesMap === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezonesMap` function now checks for the exact value of `timezonesMap` being `undefined`, instead of checking if it's falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezonesMap?.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezonesMap` function now checks if `timezonesMap` is an array and has a length, which would cause the function to always return `undefined` since `timezonesMap` is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(timezonesMap).length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezonesMap` function now checks if `timezonesMap` is an empty object, which would cause the function to always return `undefined` since `timezonesMap` is initially `undefined`.
