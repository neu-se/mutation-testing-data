  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator would return "undefined" instead of "function" for the `resolver` variable, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` and throw a `TypeError` exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator would return "object" instead of "function" for the `resolver` variable, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` and throw a `TypeError` exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator would return "number" instead of "function" for the `resolver` variable, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` and throw a `TypeError` exception.

DONE.
