Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `unhandledRejections` array to contain `null` instead of the actual promise, leading to incorrect tracking of unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert `undefined` into the `unhandledRejections` array, which could lead to confusion and errors when trying to identify which promises are unhandled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"string"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a string to the `unhandledRejections` array instead of the promise object, which would break the logic that relies on the promise being an instance of the `Promise` class.

DONE.
