  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['im']` refers to the imaginary part of the complex number, while `b` refers to the absolute value of the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because `-this['im']` refers to the negative of the imaginary part of the complex number, while `b` refers to the absolute value of the imaginary part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['im'] + 1` refers to the sum of the imaginary part of the complex number and 1, while `b` refers to the absolute value of the imaginary part.

DONE.
