  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise; !!p; p = p.source
```
This would result in different behavior because the code fragment is a no-op, and the `promise` object is not modified.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise; p = p.source; !!p
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise` object is modified, and the `!!p` expression is evaluated after the `p = p.source` assignment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise; p = p.source; p = !!p
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise` object is modified, and the `p = !!p` assignment is evaluated after the `p = p.source` assignment.

DONE.
