  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NULL
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `b` variable is an object, but in the modified code, it is `null`, which could cause errors when trying to access its properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
UNDEFINED
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `b` is an object, but in the modified code, it is `undefined`, which could cause errors when trying to access its properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `b` is an object, but in the modified code, it is an empty object, which could cause errors when trying to access its properties.

DONE.
