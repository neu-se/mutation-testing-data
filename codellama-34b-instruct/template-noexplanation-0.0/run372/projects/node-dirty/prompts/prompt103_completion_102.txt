  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val
```
This change would cause the `delete` method to be called on the `row.val` property, which is not a function and would result in a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key + 1
```
This change would cause the `delete` method to be called on the `row.key + 1` property, which is not a valid property and would result in a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key.toUpperCase()
```
This change would cause the `delete` method to be called on the `row.key.toUpperCase()` property, which is not a valid property and would result in a runtime error.

DONE.
