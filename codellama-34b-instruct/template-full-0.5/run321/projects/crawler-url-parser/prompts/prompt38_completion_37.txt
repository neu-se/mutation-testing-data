  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr, false, false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse` function would not be called with the `parseQueryString` and `slashesDenoteHost` options set to `true`, which could cause the URL to be parsed incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr, true, false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse` function would be called with the `parseQueryString` option set to `true`, but the `slashesDenoteHost` option set to `false`, which could cause the URL to be parsed incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse` function would be called with the `slashesDenoteHost` option set to `true`, but the `parseQueryString` option set to `false`, which could cause the URL to be parsed incorrectly.
