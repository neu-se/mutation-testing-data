  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would be called with a different argument, which could cause the iterator to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would be called with a different argument, which could cause the iterator to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would be called with a different argument, which could cause the delta to be modified in a different way.

DONE.
