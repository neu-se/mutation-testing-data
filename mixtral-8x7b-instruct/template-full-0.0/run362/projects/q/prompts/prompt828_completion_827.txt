 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.onerror` function is not being called, and instead an empty function is being called. This would prevent any errors from being handled by the `Q` library.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.onerror` function is being replaced with `null`, which would throw a `TypeError` when the `onerror` property is accessed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
123
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.onerror` function is being replaced with an integer, which would also throw a `TypeError` when the `onerror` property is accessed.

DONE.
