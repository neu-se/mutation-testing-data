  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromCallback` is a function that takes a callback as its first argument, whereas `universalify.fromPromise` is a function that takes a promise as its first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromPromise` is a function that takes a promise as its first argument, whereas `universalify.fromCallback` is a function that takes a callback as its first argument.
