  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val
```
This would result in different behavior because `row.val` is a different property than `row.key`, and the code that uses the value of `row.key` would not be affected by the change.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `row.key + 1` would return a different value than `row.key`, and the code that uses the value of `row.key` would not be affected by the change.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `row.key.toUpperCase()` would return a different value than `row.key`, and the code that uses the value of `row.key` would not be affected by the change.

DONE.
