  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.sqrt` function returns the square root of a number, whereas the original code fragment returns the square root of a complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(a, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow` function returns the result of raising a number to a power, whereas the original code fragment returns the square root of a complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.log` function returns the natural logarithm of a number, whereas the original code fragment returns the square root of a complex number.

DONE.
