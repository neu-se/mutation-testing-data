  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done && !done
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has higher precedence than the `!` operator, so the expression would evaluate to `false` even if `done` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done || !done
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has higher precedence than the `!` operator, so the expression would evaluate to `true` even if `done` is `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!done && done
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator has higher precedence than the `&&` operator, so the expression would evaluate to `false` even if `done` is `true`.

DONE.
