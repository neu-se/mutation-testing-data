  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'i' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return the plural form of words that end in -us, while the new code fragment would return the plural form of words that end in -us or -ss.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'i' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return the plural form of words that end in -us, while the new code fragment would return the plural form of words that end in -i.
