  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
captureLine + 1
```
This will cause the `qEndingLine` variable to be set to the line number of the next line after the `captureLine` function call, rather than the line number of the `captureLine` function call itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
captureLine - 1
```
This will cause the `qEndingLine` variable to be set to the line number of the previous line before the `captureLine` function call, rather than the line number of the `captureLine` function call itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
captureLine * 2
```
This will cause the `qEndingLine` variable to be set to twice the line number of the `captureLine` function call, rather than the line number of the `captureLine` function call itself.

DONE.
