  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof linkurl == "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `linkurl` is a string, but the replaced code fragment checks if `linkurl` is an object. If `linkurl` is not a string, the original code fragment would return `false`, but the replaced code fragment would return `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl instanceof URL
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `linkurl` is a string, but the replaced code fragment checks if `linkurl` is an instance of the `URL` class. If `linkurl` is not a string, the original code fragment would return `false`, but the replaced code fragment would return `true` if `linkurl` is an instance of `URL`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.includes("://")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `linkurl
