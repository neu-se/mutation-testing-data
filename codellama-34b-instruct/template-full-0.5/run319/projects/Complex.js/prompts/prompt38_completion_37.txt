  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a < 2999 && _b < 2999
```
This would result in different behavior because the constant 3000 is replaced with 2999, which would cause the condition to evaluate to true even if `_a` and `_b` are slightly larger than 3000.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a < 3000 && _b < 2999
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition for `_b` is now checking if it is less than 2999 instead of 3000, which would cause the condition to evaluate to true even if `_b` is slightly larger than 3000.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a < 2999 || _b < 2999
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition is now using the logical OR operator instead of the logical AND operator
