Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek()` retrieves the next operation without advancing the iterator, potentially causing the same operation to be processed multiple times instead of moving forward in the sequence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because calling `next(1)` advances the iterator by one unit, which may not correspond to the actual length of the operation being processed, leading to incorrect handling of the operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because calling `next(0)` would effectively do nothing and return the current operation without advancing the iterator, which could lead to an infinite loop or repeated processing of the same operation.

DONE.
