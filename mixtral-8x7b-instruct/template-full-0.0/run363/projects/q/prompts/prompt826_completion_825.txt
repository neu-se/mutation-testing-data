 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function would not receive the error object as its argument, which could cause issues in error handling and reporting.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
error, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function would not receive the promise object as its argument, which could cause issues in handling timeouts and managing the state of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
42, promise
