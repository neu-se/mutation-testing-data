  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `/` operator to split the string into an array of substrings, while the new code fragment is using the `\\` operator to split the string into an array of substrings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"/"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `/` operator to split the string into an array of substrings, while the new code fragment is using the `/` operator to split the string into an array of substrings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `/` operator to split the string into an array of substrings, while the new code fragment is using the `\\` operator to split the string into an array of substrings.

DONE.
