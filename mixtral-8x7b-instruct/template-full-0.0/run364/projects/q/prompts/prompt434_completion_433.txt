 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trackRejection` function would always execute, even if unhandled rejection tracking has been stopped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trackRejection` function would always execute, and `trackUnhandledRejections` would be set to `null`, which would cause issues if the code attempts to set it to `false` later.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trackRejection` function would always execute, and `trackUnhandledRejections` would be set to `0`, which would cause issues if the code attempts to use it as a boolean later.

DONE.
