  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is called on the `Dirty` object, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.emit
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is called on the `WriteStream` object, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.emit
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is called on the `ReadStream` object, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
