  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was using array_slice(arguments, 1), which included the first argument, while this new code does not include the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was using array_slice(arguments, 1), which included the first argument, while this new code includes the first and second arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 4)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was using array_slice(arguments, 1), which included the first argument, while this new code includes the first, second, and third arguments.

DONE.
