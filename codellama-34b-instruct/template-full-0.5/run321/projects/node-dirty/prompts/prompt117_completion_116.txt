  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('read_close', this._readStream);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not pass any arguments to the `emit` function, while this code passes a reference to the `_readStream` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('read_close', 'readStream');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes a reference to the `_readStream` object, while this code passes the string `'readStream'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('read_close', null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes a reference to the `_readStream` object, while this code passes `null`.

DONE.
