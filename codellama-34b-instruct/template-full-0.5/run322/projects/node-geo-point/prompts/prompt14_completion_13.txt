  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the result of the `Array.isArray` check, so if the `point.coordinates` is an array, the check would return `false`, and if it is not an array, the check would return `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(point.coordinates) && point.coordinates.length === 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would check if both conditions are true, so if the `point.coordinates` is an array and has a length of 2, the check would return `true`, otherwise it would return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length === 2 && Array.isArray(point.coordinates)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would check if both conditions are true, so if
