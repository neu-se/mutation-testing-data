  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first character of the part string, which could change the resulting regex pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a substring of the part string starting from the second character, which could change the resulting regex pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.charAt(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first character of the part string, which could change the resulting regex pattern.

DONE.
