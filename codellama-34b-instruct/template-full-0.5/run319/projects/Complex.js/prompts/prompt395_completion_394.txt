  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` and `Math.cos` have different return values for the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin`, `Math.cos`, and `Math.tan` have different return values for the same input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.csc
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin`, `Math.cos`, `Math.tan`, and `Math.csc` have different return values for the same input.

DONE.
