 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Error('Buggy code fragment')
```
This would result in different behavior because a new error object is created instead of using the original exception. This could cause the error handling code to behave differently, especially if the original exception's type or properties are relied upon.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because null is being returned instead of propagating the exception. This could cause the error handling code to not execute, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because it refers to the current execution context, which might not be the expected object (the promise). This could cause issues in the error handling code, especially if the original exception is expected to be thrown or caught.

DONE.
