  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, options[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `options` is an object, and `options[0]` would be `undefined`, causing the `stringify` function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, options.foo
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.foo` is not a valid property of the `options` object, causing the `stringify` function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.encoding` is a different property than `options.reviver`, which is the one that is used in the original code. This would cause the `stringify` function to use a different encoding than the one that was intended.

DONE.
