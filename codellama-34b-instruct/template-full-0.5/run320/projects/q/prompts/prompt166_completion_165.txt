  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because `i` would be decremented instead of incremented, leading to a different outcome in the loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `i` would be incremented by 2 instead of 1, leading to a different outcome in the loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i *= 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `i` would be multiplied by 2 instead of being incremented, leading to a different outcome in the loop.

DONE.
