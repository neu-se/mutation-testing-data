  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(null, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is not the same as the `abortCb` function, which has a different signature. The `abortCb` function takes three arguments, while the `cb` function takes two.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(1, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function expects the first argument to be a function, but `1` is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(function() {}, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function expects the first argument to be a function that takes the same arguments as the `cb` function, but the anonymous function `function() {}` does not have the same signature as the `cb
