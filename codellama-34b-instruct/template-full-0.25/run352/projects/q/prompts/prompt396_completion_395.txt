  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return `undefined` instead of the expected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { throw new Error(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would throw an error instead of returning a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return null; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return `null` instead of the expected value.

DONE.
