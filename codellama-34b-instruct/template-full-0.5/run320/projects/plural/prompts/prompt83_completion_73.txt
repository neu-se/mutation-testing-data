  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mice'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for the plural form of the word "mouse," but the new code fragment is checking for the plural form of the word "mice."

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'monkey'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for the plural form of the word "mouse," but the new code fragment is checking for the plural form of the word "monkey."

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mouses'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for the plural form of the word "mouse," but the new code fragment is checking for the plural form of the word "mouses."

DONE.
