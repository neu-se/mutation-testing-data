  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting substring would be one character shorter than the original.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting substring would be one character longer than the original.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - Math.floor(Math.random() * w.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting substring would have a random length between 0 and the original length.

DONE.
