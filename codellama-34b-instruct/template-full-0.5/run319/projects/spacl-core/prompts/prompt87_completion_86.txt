  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method expects a `string` as its first argument, but `null` is not a valid `string`. The method would throw a `TypeError` when trying to access the `length` property of `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method expects a `string` as its first argument, but `undefined` is not a valid `string`. The method would throw a `TypeError` when trying to access the `length` property of `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method expects a `string` as its first argument, but `<PLACEHOLDER>` is not a valid `string`. The method would throw a `TypeError` when trying to
