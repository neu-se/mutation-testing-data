  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name + "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append the string "foo" to the name, which would cause the method to be called with a different name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the method with the name in uppercase, which could cause a different method to be called if the name is case-sensitive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the method with the length of the name as the argument, which could cause a different method to be called if the method expects a string as an argument.

DONE.
