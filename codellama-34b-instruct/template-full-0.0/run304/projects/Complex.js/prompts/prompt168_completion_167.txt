  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method is not defined for the `Complex` class, so the code would throw a `TypeError` if the placeholder is replaced with this code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method is not defined for the `Complex` class, so the code would throw a `TypeError` if the placeholder is replaced with this code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

DONE.
