 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new deferred object using the `Q.defer()` method instead of the original `defer()` method, which might have different behavior or properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve().defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new deferred object by calling `defer()` on a resolved promise, which might have different behavior or properties than the original `defer()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls `defer()` on the current object, which might not have the same behavior or properties as the global `defer()` method.

DONE.
