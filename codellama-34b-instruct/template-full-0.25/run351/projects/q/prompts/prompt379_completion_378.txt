  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + callback
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would cause the callback to be coerced into a number, which could result in an unexpected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would cause the callback to be coerced into a string, which could result in an unexpected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString` method would be called on the callback, which could result in an unexpected value.

DONE.
