  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromise` returns false for `undefined`, while it returns true for a promise object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromise` returns false for `NaN`, while it returns true for a promise object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromise` returns false for `null`, while it returns true for a promise object.

DONE.
