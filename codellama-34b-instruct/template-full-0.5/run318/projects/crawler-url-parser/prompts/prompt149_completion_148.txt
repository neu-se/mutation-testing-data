  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split("")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the page URL path by forward slashes, while this replacement splits it by individual characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split(" ").filter(Boolean)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the page URL path by forward slashes, while this replacement splits it by spaces and then filters out any empty strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split("/").filter(Boolean)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the page URL path by forward slashes and then filters out any empty strings, while this replacement splits it by forward slashes and then filters out any non-empty strings.

DONE.
