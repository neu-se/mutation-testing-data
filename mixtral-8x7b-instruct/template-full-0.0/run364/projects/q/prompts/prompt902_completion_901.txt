 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.fapply(nodeArgs, function(err) { deferred.reject(err); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `fapply` function with an additional callback function, which is not present in the original code. This could cause unexpected behavior or errors if the `fapply` function is not designed to accept a second argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly calls the `fail` method of the promise, bypassing the `fapply` method. This could cause the promise to reject immediately, even if the `fapply` method was intended to handle the rejection and perform additional actions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.fapply(nodeArgs).then(null, deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `then` method to handle
