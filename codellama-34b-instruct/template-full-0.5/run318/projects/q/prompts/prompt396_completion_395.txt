  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return null; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `thenResolve` method to always return `null`, regardless of the value of `value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return undefined; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `thenResolve` method to always return `undefined`, regardless of the value of `value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return value + 1; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `thenResolve` method to return a value that is one greater than the original value of `value`.

DONE.
