  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!done
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` variable is not defined in the original code, and the `!done` expression would always evaluate to `true`. This would cause the `deferred.notify` method to be called with the `newValue`, which would result in the promise being resolved with the `newValue` instead of the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` variable is not defined in the original code, and the `done` expression would always evaluate to `false`. This would cause the `deferred.notify` method to not be called, which would result in the promise being resolved with the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
threw
```
This would result in different behavior because the `threw` variable is not defined in the original code, and the `threw` expression would always evaluate to `false`. This would cause the `de
