Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'key'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a string literal instead of the actual key from the row object, causing the code to always delete the entry with the key 'key' instead of the intended dynamic key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to delete the value associated with the `val` property of the row object instead of the key, which would not correspond to any key in the `_data` map, leading to incorrect deletion behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to delete an entry with an undefined key, which would not match any existing keys in the `_data` map, effectively resulting in no deletion occurring at all.

DONE.
