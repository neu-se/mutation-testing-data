  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain === null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `retain` property is checked for null or undefined, but in this modified code, it is only checked for null. If the `retain` property is undefined, the code would behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `retain` property is checked for null or undefined, but in this modified code, it is only checked for non-null values. If the `retain` property is undefined, the code would behave differently.
