  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
concatedStacks.split("\n").reverse().join("\n")
```
This would result in different behavior because the stack trace would be reversed, which could make it difficult to understand the order of events leading up to the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
concatedStacks.replace(/\n/g, " ")
```
This would result in different behavior because the stack trace would be condensed into a single line, which could make it difficult to read and understand.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
concatedStacks.split("\n").slice(1).join("\n")
```
This would result in different behavior because the first line of the stack trace would be removed, which could make it difficult to understand the context of the error.

DONE.
