  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete an undefined property, which is a no-op, instead of deleting the property with the specified key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[""]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete a property with an empty string as its key, which is not the same as the specified key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[Math.random()]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete a property with a randomly generated key, which is not the same as the specified key.

DONE.
