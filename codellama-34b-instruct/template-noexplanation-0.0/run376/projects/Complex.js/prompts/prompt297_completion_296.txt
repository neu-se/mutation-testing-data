  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-sinh
```
This will negate the result of the `sinh` function, which will cause the `tan` function to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh
```
This will replace the `sinh` function with the `cosh` function, which will cause the `tan` function to return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sinh
```
This will replace the `sinh` function with the `Math.sinh` function, which will cause the `tan` function to return incorrect results.

DONE.
