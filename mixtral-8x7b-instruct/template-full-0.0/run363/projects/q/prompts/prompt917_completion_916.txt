 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Function.prototype.bind.call(deferred.resolve, deferred)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately call `deferred.resolve` with the `nodeArgs` array as an argument, instead of waiting for the Node.js-style callback to be called and passing its result to `deferred.resolve`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.promise.resolve
