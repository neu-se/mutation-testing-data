  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.path.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the lowercase version of the path, even if the path contains uppercase letters. This could cause the code to fail if it relies on the original case of the path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.path.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the last component of the path, rather than the entire path. This could cause the code to fail if it relies on the full path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.path.replace(/\//g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove all forward slashes from the path, even if they are not at the beginning or end of the path. This could cause the code to fail if it relies on the forward slashes to separate the path components.

DONE.
