  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled", unhandledReasons[at], unhandledRejections[at]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the wrong reason to the "rejectionHandled" event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled", reason, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the wrong reason to the "rejectionHandled" event.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled", unhandledReasons[at], reportedUnhandledRejections[at]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the wrong reason to the "rejectionHandled" event.

DONE.
