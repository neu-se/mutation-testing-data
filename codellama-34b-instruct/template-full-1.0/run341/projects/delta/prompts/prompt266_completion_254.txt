  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `opLength` variable is used to determine the length of the current operation, and by adding one, the length would be increased by one, potentially causing the algorithm to skip over the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `opLength` variable is used to determine the length of the current operation, and by subtracting one, the length would be decreased by one, potentially causing the algorithm to include an additional operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `opLength` variable is used to determine the length of the current operation, and by multiplying by two, the length would be doubled, potentially causing the algorithm to include twice as many operations.

DONE.
