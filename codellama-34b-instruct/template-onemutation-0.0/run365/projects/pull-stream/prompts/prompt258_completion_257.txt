  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err == false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `err` is strictly equal to `true`, while the new code fragment checks if `err` is loosely equal to `false`. This means that if `err` is any other value than `false`, the original code would enter the `if` block and abort the current stream, while the new code would not enter the `if` block and continue to the next chunk.

DONE.
