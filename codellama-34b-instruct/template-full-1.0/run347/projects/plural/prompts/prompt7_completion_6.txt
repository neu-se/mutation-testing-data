  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rules.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `rules.push` adds the rule to the end of the array, while `rules.unshift` adds it to the beginning.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rules.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `rules.shift` removes the first rule from the array, while `rules.unshift` adds it to the beginning.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rules.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `rules.pop` removes the last rule from the array, while `rules.unshift` adds it to the beginning.

DONE.
