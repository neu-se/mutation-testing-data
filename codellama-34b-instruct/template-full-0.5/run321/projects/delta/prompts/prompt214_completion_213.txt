  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would refer to the second operation in the `other` delta, instead of the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops[0].insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would refer to the `insert` property of the first operation in the `other` delta, instead of the operation itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops[0] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the first operation in the `other` delta, instead of using it as-is.

DONE.
