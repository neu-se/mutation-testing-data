  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('PLACEHOLDER'));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits an error with a specific message, while the replaced code emits a generic error with the message "PLACEHOLDER".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error(key));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits an error with a specific message, while the replaced code emits an error with the key as the message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error(val));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits an error with a specific message, while the replaced code emits an error with the value as the message.

DONE.
