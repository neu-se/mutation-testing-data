  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.d + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `tz.d` returns the value of the `d` property of the `tz` object, while the modified code fragment `tz.d + 1` returns the value of the `d` property plus 1. This change would cause the `dstOffset` variable to be initialized with a different value, potentially leading to different behavior in the `buildTimezone` function.

DONE.
