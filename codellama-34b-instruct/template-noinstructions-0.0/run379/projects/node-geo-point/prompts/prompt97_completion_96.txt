  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This would result in different behavior because `x` is a different variable than `y`, and it is not clear what the intended behavior of the code is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `y`, which could cause the calculation of `λ2` to be off by a small amount.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the value of `y`, which could cause the calculation of `λ2` to be off by a large amount.

DONE.
