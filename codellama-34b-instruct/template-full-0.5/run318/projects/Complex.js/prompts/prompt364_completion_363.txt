  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the unary minus operator will negate the value of `b`, which is not the same as simply using `b` as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 to `b` will change the value of the expression, which is not the same as simply using `b` as in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication of `b` by 2 will change the value of the expression, which is not the same as simply using `b` as in the original code.

DONE.
