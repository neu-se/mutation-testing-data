Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiou]y$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly matches words that end with a vowel followed by 'y', such as "play" or "day", which should not be transformed into their plural forms.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]y$|qu$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches words that end with 'qu' instead of 'quy', which would incorrectly exclude words like "soliloquy" from being transformed into their plural forms.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]y$|quy|[^aeiou]y$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it redundantly matches the same pattern twice, which could lead to unexpected results or inefficiencies in the pluralization logic.

DONE.
