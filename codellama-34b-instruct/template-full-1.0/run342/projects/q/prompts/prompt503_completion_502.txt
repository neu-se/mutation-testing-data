  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).apply(thisp, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(value).apply()` will return a new promise, and the `args` variable may contain a value that is different from the one passed to the original `value.apply()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise(value.apply(thisp, args));
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise()` will create a new promise, and the `args` variable may contain a value that is different from the one passed to the original `value.apply()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer().invoke(value, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer().invoke()` will create a new promise and invoke the `value` method with the given `args`, which may be different from the ones passed to the original `Promise()` constructor.

DONE.
