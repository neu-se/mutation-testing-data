  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ1
```
This change will cause the `calculateDestination` method to always return the same point, regardless of the input coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosφ1
```
This change will cause the `calculateDestination` method to always return a point with a latitude of 0, regardless of the input coordinates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ2 * cosφ1
```
This change will cause the `calculateDestination` method to always return a point with a latitude of 0, regardless of the input coordinates.

DONE.
