  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This change will cause the `toTile` method to return incorrect tile coordinates, which will result in errors when trying to access the tile data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This change will cause the `toTile` method to return incorrect tile coordinates, which will result in errors when trying to access the tile data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan
```
This change will cause the `toTile` method to return incorrect tile coordinates, which will result in errors when trying to access the tile data.

DONE.
