  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op, index) => !predicate(op, index)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `predicate` function to filter the `ops` array, while the modified code fragment uses the negation of the `predicate` function to filter the `ops` array. This means that the modified code fragment will include all elements that the original code fragment would exclude, and vice versa.
