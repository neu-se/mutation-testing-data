  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
head = tail;
```
This would result in an infinite loop because the `runSingle` function is never called, causing the `head` variable to never be updated to the next task in the queue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flushing = true;
```
This would result in an infinite loop because the `runSingle` function is never called, causing the `flushing` variable to never be updated to `false` when the queue is empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.push(task);
```
This would result in the task being added to the `laterQueue` instead of the normal queue, causing it to be executed at a later time and potentially causing a delay in the processing of other tasks.

DONE.
