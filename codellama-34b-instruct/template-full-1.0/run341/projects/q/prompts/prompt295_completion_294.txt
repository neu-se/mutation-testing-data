  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always resolve the promise with a value of `null`, regardless of the reason for the rejection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason + " WHY this is bad"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append the string " WHY this is bad" to the reason for the rejection, which would change the error message that would be logged.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw a new error with the reason for the rejection as the message, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the new error instead of being resolved with a value of `null`.

DONE.
