  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start + index
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the minus operator, which subtracts the index from the start, while this replacement code fragment uses the plus operator, which adds the index to the start. This would cause the code to behave differently when the index is a negative number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start * index
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the minus operator, which subtracts the index from the start, while this replacement code fragment uses the multiplication operator, which multiplies the index by the start. This would cause the code to behave differently when the index is a non-zero number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start / index
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the minus operator, which subtracts the index from the start, while this replacement code fragment uses the division operator, which divides the start by the index. This would cause the code to behave differently
