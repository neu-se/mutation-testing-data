  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the result of `this['isInfinite']`, causing the `return Complex['INFINITY']` statement to be executed even if `this['isInfinite']` is false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'] && z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would require both `this['isInfinite']` and `z['isInfinite']` to be true in order to execute the `return Complex['INFINITY']` statement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'] || z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would require either `this['isInfinite']` or `z['isInfinite']` to be true in order to execute the `return Complex['INF
