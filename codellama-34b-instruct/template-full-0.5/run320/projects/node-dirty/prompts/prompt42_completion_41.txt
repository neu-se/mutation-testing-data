  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key
```
This would result in different behavior because `key` is a string, and `val` is a JSON object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val.key
```
This would result in different behavior because `val` is a JSON object, and `val.key` would return the value of the `key` property of the object, which may be different from the `key` string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(val)
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify(val)` would return a JSON string representation of the `val` object, which may be different from the `key` string.

DONE.
