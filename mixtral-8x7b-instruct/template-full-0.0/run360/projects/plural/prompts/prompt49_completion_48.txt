 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
addRule.bind(null, /[^aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `Function.bind` to partially apply the first argument of `addRule`, creating a function that ignores the first argument (the `this` value) when called. This could cause issues if the mutated code relies on the `this` value being set to the correct object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(function() { addRule(/[^aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' }) })()
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps the call to `addRule` in an immediately-invoked function expression (IIFE). This could cause issues if the mutated code relies on variables or functions in the outer scope, as they would not be accessible inside the IIFE.

Option 3: The
