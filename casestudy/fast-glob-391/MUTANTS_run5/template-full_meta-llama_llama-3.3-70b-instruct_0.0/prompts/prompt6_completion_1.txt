Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._settings.negative
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a potentially undefined property of the settings object instead of the actual negative patterns array, potentially leading to incorrect filtering.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses an empty array instead of the actual negative patterns array, effectively disabling negative pattern filtering.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
positive
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the positive patterns array instead of the actual negative patterns array, potentially leading to incorrect filtering by matching against the wrong set of patterns.

DONE.
