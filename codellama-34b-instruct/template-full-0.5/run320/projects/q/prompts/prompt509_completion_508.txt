  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid `this` value, and would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid `this` value, and would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty object is not a valid `this` value, and would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

DONE.
