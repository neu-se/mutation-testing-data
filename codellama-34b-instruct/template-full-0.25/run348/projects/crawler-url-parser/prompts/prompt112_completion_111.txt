  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `currentUrl` variable would be initialized to `null`, which would cause the `if (currentUrl && currentUrl.url)` condition to fail, even if `currentUrl.url` is a valid URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `currentUrl` variable would be initialized to `undefined`, which would cause the `if (currentUrl && currentUrl.url)` condition to fail, even if `currentUrl.url` is a valid URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl = "http://example.com";
```
This would result in different behavior because the `currentUrl` variable would be initialized to a hardcoded URL, which would cause the `if (currentUrl && currentUrl.url)` condition to pass, even if `currentUrl.url` is not a valid URL.
