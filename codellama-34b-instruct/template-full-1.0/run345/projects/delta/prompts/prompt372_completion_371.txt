  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `Op.length` returns the length of an operation, whereas `Op.retain` returns the retained length of an operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `Op.length` returns the length of an operation, whereas `Op.delete` returns the deleted length of an operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `Op.length` returns the length of an operation, whereas `Op.insert` returns the inserted length of an operation.

DONE.
