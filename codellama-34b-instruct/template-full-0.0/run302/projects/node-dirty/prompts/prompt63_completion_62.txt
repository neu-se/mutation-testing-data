  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because `end()` would close the write stream immediately, without waiting for the buffer to be flushed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy()
```
This would result in different behavior because `destroy()` would close the write stream immediately, without waiting for the buffer to be flushed, and would also cause any pending writes to be discarded.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(() => this._writeStream.destroy())
```
This would result in different behavior because `end()` would close the write stream immediately, without waiting for the buffer to be flushed, and `destroy()` would be called after the stream is closed, which would cause any pending writes to be discarded.

DONE.
