  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id
```
This would result in different behavior because the abbreviation `id` is a built-in JavaScript function that returns a string identifying an object's type, whereas the original code fragment `id, options` is a comma-delimited list of two parameters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id, options['deprecated']
```
This would result in different behavior because `options['deprecated']` is a Boolean value indicating whether the `options` object includes the key 'deprecated', whereas the original code fragment `id, options` is a comma-delimited list of two parameters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id, options()
```
This would result in different behavior because `options()` is a function call that involves a side effect, whereas the original code fragment `id, options` is a comma-delimited list of two parameters.

DONE.
