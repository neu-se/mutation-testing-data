  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|index|quiz/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the new fragment includes the word "quiz," which was not present in the original fragment. This would cause the test to fail if the word "quiz" is passed to the `plural` function, as it would not match any of the existing rules and would therefore return the original word with "s" appended, rather than the expected "quizzes."

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|index|[a-z]+/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the new fragment includes a character class that matches any letter, rather than the specific words "appendix" and "index." This would cause the test to fail if any other word is passed to the `plural` function, as it would match the new fragment and return the original word with "s" appended, rather than the expected plural form.
