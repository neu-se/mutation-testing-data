  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the order of the objects in the `reduce` method, potentially causing the resulting `AttributeMap` to have different keys and values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the values of the `a` object with the keys of the `b` object, rather than the values of the `b` object with the keys of the `a` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the values of the `b` object with the keys of the `a` object, rather than the values of the `a` object with the keys of the `b` object.

DONE.
