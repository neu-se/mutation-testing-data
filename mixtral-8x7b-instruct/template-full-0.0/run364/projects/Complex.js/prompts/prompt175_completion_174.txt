 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c.valueOf() < d.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because it compares the numeric primitive values of `c` and `d`, instead of their absolute values. This could lead to incorrect results when the signs of `c` and `d` are different but their absolute values are equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(c) < Math.abs(d.valueOf())
```
This would result in different behavior because it compares the absolute value of `c` with the absolute value of the numeric primitive value of `d`. This could lead to incorrect results when the sign of `d` is different from its original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c < d && Math.abs(c) > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `c` is less than `d` and if the absolute value of `c` is greater than 0.
