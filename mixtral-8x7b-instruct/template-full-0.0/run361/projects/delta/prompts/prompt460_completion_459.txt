 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rest()` method would skip an operation after the current one, instead of starting from the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rest()` method would refer to the previous operation instead of the current one, potentially causing out-of-bounds errors or incorrect behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Math.floor(Math.random() * this.ops.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rest()` method would return a random set of operations from the list instead of the expected continuation of the sequence, making the iterator's behavior unpredictable and inconsistent.

By introducing these changes, we can expose potential weaknesses in the test suite, as the tests should fail due to the altered behavior of the `rest()
