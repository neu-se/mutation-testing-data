  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isGlob(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because a negated glob expression would match a file instead of skip it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',').forEach(() => {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function is empty, so the glob expressions would not be processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split('').forEach((globPart) => {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the glob expressions would be split at every character, so only single-character glob expressions would be matched.

DONE.
