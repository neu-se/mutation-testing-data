  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.attributes.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` is an attribute of `elem` that may not be intended to be accessed directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.attributes?.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the `?.` syntax is a way to safely access properties of an object without raising errors, but it may cause the code to behave differently if `elem.attributes` is `null` or `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.attributes!.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!.` syntax is a way to force access to an object property, but it may cause the code to behave differently if `elem.attributes` is `null` or `undefined`.

DONE.
