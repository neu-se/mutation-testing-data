  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_create(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_create(null)` creates a new object with a null prototype, while `object_create` creates a new object with a default prototype based on the constructor function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.create(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.create(null)` creates a new object with a null prototype, while `object_create` creates a new object with a default prototype based on the constructor function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.create(Object.prototype)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.create(Object.prototype)` creates a new object with the `Object.prototype` as its prototype, while `object_create` creates a new object with a default prototype based on the constructor function.

DONE.
