  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromCallback` is a different function than `universalify.fromPromise`, and it has a different signature.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFile)
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromCallback` expects a function as its first argument, but `fs.readFile` is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFile, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromCallback` expects a function as its first argument, but `fs.readFile` is not a function. Additionally, `options` is not a valid argument for `universalify.fromCallback`.

DONE.
