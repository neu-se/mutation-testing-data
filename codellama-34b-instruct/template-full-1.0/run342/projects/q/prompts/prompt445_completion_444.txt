  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"uncaughtException", reason, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because "uncaughtException" is a different event than "unhandledRejection", and it would not capture the same type of errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection", reason, reason
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the reason to the promise as the second argument, instead of the actual promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection", reason, new Error(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new Error object with the reason as the message, instead of passing the reason directly.

DONE.
