  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
totalTimezones !== memoizedTimezones + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `memoizedTimezones` variable is incremented every time a new timezone is memoized, so the condition would never be true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
totalTimezones !== Object.keys(timezones).length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `timezones` object is mutated every time a new timezone is memoized, so the length of the object would be different from the `totalTimezones` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
totalTimezones !== data.timezones.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `data.timezones` array is not mutated when a new timezone is memoized, so the length of the array would be the same as the `totalTimezones` variable.

DONE.
