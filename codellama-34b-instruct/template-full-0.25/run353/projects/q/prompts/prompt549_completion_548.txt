  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.value` is always `undefined` for a promise, whereas `result.done` is a boolean indicating whether the promise is resolved or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.rejected` is always `undefined` for a promise, whereas `result.done` is a boolean indicating whether the promise is resolved or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.pending
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.pending` is always `undefined` for a promise, whereas `result.done` is a boolean indicating whether the promise is resolved or not.

DONE.
