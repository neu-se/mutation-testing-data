  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, which could cause the promise to be rejected instead of fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because both arguments are the same, which could cause the promise to be fulfilled twice.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because both arguments are the same, which could cause the promise to be rejected twice.

DONE.
