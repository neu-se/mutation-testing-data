Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops.push(...other.ops);
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the original `delta.ops` array by adding elements to it, rather than creating a new array that concatenates the two, which could lead to unintended side effects if `delta` is used elsewhere.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops = other.ops.slice();
```
This would result in different behavior because it completely replaces `delta.ops` with `other.ops`, losing any existing operations in `delta`, rather than appending `other.ops` to it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops = delta.ops.concat(other.ops.reverse());
```
This would result in different behavior because it concatenates the reversed `other.ops` to `delta.ops`, changing the order of operations and potentially altering the outcome of subsequent operations.

DONE.
