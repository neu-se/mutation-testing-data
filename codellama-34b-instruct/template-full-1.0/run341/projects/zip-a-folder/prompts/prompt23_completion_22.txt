  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiver.finish
```
This would result in different behavior because `finish` is a different method from `archiver` that creates a finalize stream for the archive, and using it would cause the `compress` method to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiver.drain
```
This would result in different behavior because `drain` is a different method from `archiver` that finishes the archive when all files are streamed in, and using it would cause the `compress` method to finish the archive too early.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiver.finalize
```
This would result in different behavior because `finalize` is a different method from `archiver` that finalizes the archive and pipes it to the output stream, and using it would cause the `compress` method to pipe the archive to the output stream too early.

DONE.
