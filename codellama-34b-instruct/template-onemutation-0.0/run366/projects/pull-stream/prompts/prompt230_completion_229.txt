  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `test` function, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if the `test` function returns `true`. This would cause the `next` function to always return `undefined`, even if the `read` function returns a value.

DONE.
