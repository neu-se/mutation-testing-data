  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` returns a promise that is resolved when the function is called, but `Q.defer().reject` returns a promise that is rejected when the function is called, which would cause the `put` method to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer().resolve(null)` returns a promise that is resolved with a value of `null`, which would cause the `put` method to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().reject(new Error("error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer().reject(new Error("error"))` returns a promise that is rejected with an error, which would cause the `put` method to fail.

DONE.
