  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `abort`, which would cause the `sink.abort()` method to be called with the `abort` variable as an argument. Replacing it with `null` would cause the `sink.abort()` method to be called with a `null` argument instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `abort`, which would cause the `sink.abort()` method to be called with the `abort` variable as an argument. Replacing it with `undefined` would cause the `sink.abort()` method to be called with an `undefined` argument instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
