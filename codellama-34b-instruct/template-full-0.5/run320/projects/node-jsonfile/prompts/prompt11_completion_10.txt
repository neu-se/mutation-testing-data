  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a string, but null is not a string and would cause a type error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a string, but undefined is not a string and would cause a type error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a string, but an empty string is not a valid JSON string and would cause a parse error.

DONE.
