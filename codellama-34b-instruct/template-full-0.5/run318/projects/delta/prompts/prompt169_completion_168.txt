  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next` is a different iterator than `thisIter.next`, and it would change the order of the operations being composed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only advance the iterator by one step, instead of the full length of the operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only advance the other iterator by one step, instead of the full length of the operation.

DONE.
