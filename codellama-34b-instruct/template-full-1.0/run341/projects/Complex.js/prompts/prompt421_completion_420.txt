  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate to true only if the real and imaginary parts of the complex number are equal, whereas the original code would evaluate to true if the real part is equal to zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] !== this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate to false only if the real and imaginary parts of the complex number are not equal, whereas the original code would evaluate to false if the real part is not equal to zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate to true only if the real part is equal to zero, whereas the original code would evaluate to true if the real and imaginary parts of the complex number are equal.

DONE.
