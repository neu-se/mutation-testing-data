  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, str, options, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `null` argument would cause the `fs.writeFile` function to throw an error, which would be caught by the `universalify.fromCallback` function and returned as a rejected promise. This would cause the `writeFile` function to return a rejected promise, which would be caught by the `writeFileSync` function and returned as `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, str, options, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `undefined` argument would cause the `fs.writeFile` function to throw an error, which would be caught by the `universalify.fromCallback` function and returned as a rejected promise. This would cause the `writeFile` function to return a rejected promise, which would be caught by the `writeFileSync` function and returned as `null`.
