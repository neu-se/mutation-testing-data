 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns the length of the `ops` array, instead of the index provided to the `chop` method. This could lead to incorrect behavior when manipulating the delta operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns 0, instead of the index provided to the `chop` method. This could lead to incorrect behavior when manipulating the delta operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
inverted.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the length of the `ops` array of the `inverted` delta, instead of the index provided to the `chop` method. This could lead to incorrect behavior when manipulating the delta operations.

DONE.
