  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.set
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.set` method is not defined in the original code fragment, and therefore would cause a runtime error if used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.del
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.del` method is not defined in the original code fragment, and therefore would cause a runtime error if used.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.all` method is not defined in the original code fragment, and therefore would cause a runtime error if used.

DONE.
