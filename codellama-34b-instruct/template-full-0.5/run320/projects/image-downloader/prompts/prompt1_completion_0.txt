  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!options.url` check only checks if the `url` property is falsy, while `options.url === undefined` checks if the `url` property is strictly equal to `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url !== ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!options.url` check only checks if the `url` property is falsy, while `options.url !== ''` checks if the `url` property is not an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!options.url.startsWith('http')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!options.url` check only checks if the `url` property is falsy, while `!options.url.startsWith('http')` checks if the `url` property does not start with the string `'http'`.

DONE.
