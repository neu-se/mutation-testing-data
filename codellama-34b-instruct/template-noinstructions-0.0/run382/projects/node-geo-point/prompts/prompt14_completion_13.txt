  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(point.coordinates) && point.coordinates.length === 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `coordinates` property is an array and has a length of 2, which is not the same as checking if the `coordinates` property is an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length === 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `coordinates` property has a length of 2, which is not the same as checking if the `coordinates` property is an array.

DONE.
