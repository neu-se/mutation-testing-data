 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 'NAN' when the imaginary part of the first complex number is not equal to the imaginary part of the second complex number, even if both numbers are not infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 'INFINITY' when the first complex number is infinite, regardless of the second complex number's value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re'] * z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly calculate the result when both complex numbers have non-zero imaginary parts.

DONE.
