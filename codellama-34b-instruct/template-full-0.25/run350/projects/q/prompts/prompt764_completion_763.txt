  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(promise, onFulfilled, onRejected, onProgress);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `when` function is not defined in the provided code snippet, and it is not clear what its purpose is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(onFulfilled, onRejected, onProgress);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is not defined in the provided code snippet, and it is not clear what its purpose is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().then(onFulfilled, onRejected, onProgress);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method is not defined in the provided code snippet, and it is not clear what its purpose is.

DONE.
