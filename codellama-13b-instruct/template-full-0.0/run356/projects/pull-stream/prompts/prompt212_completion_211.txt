  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb = cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` variable would be assigned the `cb` function, which would cause the `abortCb` function to be called instead of the `cb` function when the `abort` parameter is passed to the `next` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` variable would be set to `null`, which would cause the `abortCb` function to not be called when the `abort` parameter is passed to the `next` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb = function (err) { console.log(err) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` variable would be assigned a new function that logs the `err` parameter to the console, which would cause the `abort
