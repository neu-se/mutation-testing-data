  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the same element on each iteration, instead of advancing to the next element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i+1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the element at the next index in the array, instead of the current element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i*2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the element at the double index in the array, instead of the current element.

DONE.
