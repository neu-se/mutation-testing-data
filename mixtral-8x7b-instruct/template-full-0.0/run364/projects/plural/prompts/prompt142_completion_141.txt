 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
rule[0] instanceof String && rule[0] === word
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for an instance of the String object instead of checking if the string is a primitive string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof rule[0] === 'string' && rule[0] === word
