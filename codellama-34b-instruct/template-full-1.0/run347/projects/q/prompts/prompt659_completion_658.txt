  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `arguments, 3`. This would result in different behavior because the replacement code fragment would pass 3 instead of 2 as the second argument to `array_slice()`, which would result in a different set of arguments being passed to the `post` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `arguments.slice(2)`. This would result in different behavior because the replacement code fragment would use the `slice` method to extract the third and subsequent arguments, rather than the `arguments` object itself, which would result in a different set of arguments being passed to the `post` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `args.slice(2)`. This would result in different behavior because the replacement code fragment would use the `slice` method to extract the third and subsequent arguments from the `args` array, rather than the `arguments` object, which would result in a different set of arguments being passed to the `post` method.

DONE.
