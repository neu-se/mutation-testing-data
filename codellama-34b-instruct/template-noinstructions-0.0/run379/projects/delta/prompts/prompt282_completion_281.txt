  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const thisData = thisOp.retain;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `thisData` variable to be assigned the value of `thisOp.retain`, which is an object, rather than the value of `thisOp.insert`, which is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const thisData = thisOp.insert;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `thisData` variable to be assigned the value of `thisOp.insert`, which is a string, rather than the value of `thisOp.retain`, which is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const thisData = thisOp.delete;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `thisData` variable to be assigned the value of `thisOp.delete`, which is a number, rather than the value of `thisOp.retain`, which is an object.
