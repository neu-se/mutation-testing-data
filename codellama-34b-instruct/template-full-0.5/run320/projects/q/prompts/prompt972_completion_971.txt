  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name, args.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` creates a shallow copy of the `args` array, which would cause the `nmapply` method to pass a different value to the `post` method, potentially leading to a different execution path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name, args.concat([])
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` creates a new array by concatenating `args` with an empty array, which would cause the `nmapply` method to pass a different value to the `post` method, potentially leading to a different execution path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name, args.filter(Boolean)
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` creates a new array by removing any falsy values from `args`, which would cause the `nmapply` method to pass a different value to the `post` method, potentially leading to a different execution path
