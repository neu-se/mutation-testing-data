  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the queue is empty, while this new code fragment checks if the queue is not empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the queue is not empty, while this new code fragment checks if the queue is empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size > 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the queue is not empty, while this new code fragment checks if the queue has more than 10 items.

DONE.
