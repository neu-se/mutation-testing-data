  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isObject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the result of `isObject`, making the code fragment always return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isArray
```
This would result in different behavior because `isArray` checks if the value is an array, not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFunction
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFunction` checks if the value is a function, not an object.

DONE.
