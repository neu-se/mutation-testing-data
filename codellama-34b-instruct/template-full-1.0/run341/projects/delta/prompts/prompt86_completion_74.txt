  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here are three possible places to replace the PLACEHOLDER with different code fragments:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `lastOp.attributes` property would be null, and the `isEqual()` function would return true only if the two null values are compared directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `lastOp.attributes` property would be undefined, and the `isEqual()` function would return true only if the two undefined values are compared directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `lastOp.attributes` property would be an empty object, and the `isEqual()` function would return true only if the two empty objects are compared directly.

DONE.
