  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!prop
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!prop` expression would be evaluated to `false` if `prop` is truthy, which would cause the `if` statement to be skipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `prop + 1` expression would produce a different value than `prop`, which could cause the `if` statement to be evaluated differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `prop.length` expression would be evaluated to the length of the `prop` array, which could cause the `if` statement to be evaluated differently.

DONE.
