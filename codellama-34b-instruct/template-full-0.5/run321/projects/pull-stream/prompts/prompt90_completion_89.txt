  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `test` function, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when the original code would have evaluated to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function is being called with two arguments instead of one, which may cause it to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data, {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function is being called with a different object as the second argument, which may cause it to behave differently.

DONE.
