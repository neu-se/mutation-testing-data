  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the result would be negated, which could cause a bug in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the sine function would be used instead of the cosine function, which could cause a bug in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because a random number would be used instead of the cosine function, which could cause a bug in the code.

DONE.
