Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bootstrap("promise", definition);
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly passes the string "promise" as the first argument to `bootstrap`, which may lead to unexpected results if `bootstrap` expects a different type or format of input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bootstrap(definition);
```
This would result in different behavior because it omits the first argument, which may cause the `bootstrap` function to behave incorrectly or throw an error if it relies on that argument being present.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bootstraps("promise", definition);
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a typo by using `bootstraps` instead of `bootstrap`, which would lead to a reference error since `bootstraps` is not defined.

DONE.
