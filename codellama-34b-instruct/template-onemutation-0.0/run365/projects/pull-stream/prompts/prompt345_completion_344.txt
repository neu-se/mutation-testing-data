  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === false ? null : abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `abort` is `true`, but this new code fragment checks if `abort` is `false`. If `abort` is `true`, the new code fragment would return `null`, while the original code fragment would return `abort`.

DONE.
