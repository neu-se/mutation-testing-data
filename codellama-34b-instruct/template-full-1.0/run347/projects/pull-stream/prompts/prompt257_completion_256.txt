  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!err
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the boolean value of `err`, so if `err` is `true`, it would become `false`, and if it's `false`, it would become `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `err` is strictly equal to `true`, so it would be `false` if `err` is `false` or any other value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `err` is not strictly equal to `true`, so it would be `true` if `err` is `false` or any other value.

DONE.
