  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` variable is not defined in the original code, and it would cause a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `arguments` object, which is a special object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function. Replacing it with an empty array would cause the function to receive no arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `arguments` object, which is a special object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function. Replacing it with null would cause the function to receive no arguments.

DONE.
