  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, so it would throw an error when trying to call it with the `nodeify` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, so it would throw an error when trying to call it with the `nodeify` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would not have the same behavior as the original `Q` function, which is a promise library.

DONE.
