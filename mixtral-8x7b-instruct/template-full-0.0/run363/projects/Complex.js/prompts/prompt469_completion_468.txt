 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the imaginary part of the current object instead of the input `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b.valueOf() < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the input `b` to a number before comparing, which might not be desired.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Math.abs(b) < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the absolute value of `b` before comparing, which would always return `false`.

DONE.
