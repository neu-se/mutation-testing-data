  I understand, I'm ready to apply mutation testing to the code you provided.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (nextType === 'delete' || nextType === 'retain')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checked for 'delete' operations, but the modified code also checks for 'retain' operations. This would cause the transformation to be applied to more operations, resulting in a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if ( nextType === 'insert' )
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checked for 'delete' operations, but the modified code checks for 'insert' operations. This would cause the transformation to be applied to different operations, resulting in a different output.
