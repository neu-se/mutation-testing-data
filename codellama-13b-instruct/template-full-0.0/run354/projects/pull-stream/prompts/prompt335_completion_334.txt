  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` function would not be called with the `data` argument, which could cause the stream to produce unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` function would not be called with the `data` argument, which could cause the stream to produce unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` function would be called with the `data` argument, which could cause the stream to produce unexpected results.

DONE.
