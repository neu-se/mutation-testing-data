  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'abs' in a || 'arg' in a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would cause the expression to evaluate to `true` if either `'abs'` or `'arg'` is a property of `a`, whereas the original code fragment uses the `&&` operator, which requires both properties to be present.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'abs' in a && 'arg' in b
```
This would result in different behavior because the second operand of the `&&` operator is now `b` instead of `a`, which would cause the expression to evaluate to `false` if `'arg'` is not a property of `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'abs' in a && 'arg' in a && a['arg'] > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional check `a['arg'] > 0` would cause the expression to evaluate to `false` if the value of
