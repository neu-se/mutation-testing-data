  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is a keyword that throws an exception, whereas `reject` is a function that creates a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `return resolve` would return a resolved promise, whereas `reject` creates a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because `return reject(new Error())` would return a rejected promise with a new error, whereas `reject` creates a rejected promise with the original error.

DONE.
