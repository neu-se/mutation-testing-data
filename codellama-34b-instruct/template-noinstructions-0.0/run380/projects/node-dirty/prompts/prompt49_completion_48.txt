  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater(this.get(key))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `updater` function with the current value of the key, rather than the new value that is being set.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater(this.get(key), this.get(key))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `updater` function with the current value of the key, rather than the new value that is being set. Additionally, it would pass the current value of the key as both arguments to the `updater` function, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater(this.get(key), val)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `updater` function with the current value of the key, rather than the new value that is being set. Additionally, it would pass the new value
