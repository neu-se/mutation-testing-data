  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(exception.value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` will create a rejected promise, whereas `Q(exception.value)` will create a resolved promise with the exception value as its fulfillment value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(exception.value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` will create a resolved promise, whereas `Q(exception.value)` will create a rejected promise with the exception value as its rejection reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.throw(exception.value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.throw` will throw an exception, whereas `Q(exception.value)` will create a rejected promise with the exception value as its rejection reason.

DONE.
