  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the URL parsing function would not be called, and the resulting `parsedUrl` object would be `null`, leading to errors in the subsequent code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the URL parsing function would be called with an undefined parameter, leading to errors in the subsequent code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the URL parsing function would be called with a null parameter, leading to errors in the subsequent code.

DONE.
