  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the other iterator instead of the length of the this iterator, which could lead to incorrect results in the diff function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the maximum of the two lengths instead of the minimum, which could lead to incorrect results in the diff function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() * otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the product of the two lengths instead of the minimum, which could lead to incorrect results in the diff function.

DONE.
