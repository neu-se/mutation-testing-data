  Option 1: The `sinh` function in the formula for the `tanh` function can be replaced with `cosh`, which would produce a different result because `cosh` returns the hyperbolic cosine of the argument, whereas `sinh` returns the hyperbolic sine.
```
return new Complex(
    cosh(a) * Math.cos(b),
    sinh(a) * Math.sin(b));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tanh` function relies on the distinction between `sinh` and `cosh` to calculate the ratio of the two functions at a given point.
