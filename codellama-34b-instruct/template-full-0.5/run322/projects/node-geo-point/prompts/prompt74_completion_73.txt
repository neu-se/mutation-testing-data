  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() * 360
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce randomness into the calculation of the bearing, which could cause the method to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the method to always return a bearing of 90 degrees, regardless of the actual bearing between the two points.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the method to always return a bearing of 360 degrees, regardless of the actual bearing between the two points.

DONE.
