Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log` computes the natural logarithm of a number, while `Math.exp` computes the exponential function, leading to fundamentally different results in the calculation of the complex exponent.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the imaginary part of the complex number instead of the real part, which would yield incorrect results for the complex exponent calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(this['re'] + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the real part before exponentiation, effectively scaling the result by a factor of `e`, which alters the expected output of the complex exponent function.

DONE.
