  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is a reference to the variable `b`, but `b + 1` is an arithmetic expression that adds 1 to the value of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is a reference to the variable `b`, but `b * 2` is an arithmetic expression that multiplies the value of `b` by 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is a reference to the variable `b`, but `b - 1` is an arithmetic expression that subtracts 1 from the value of `b`.

DONE.
