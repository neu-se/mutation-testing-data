Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would trigger the return statement when `b` is not zero, which is the opposite of the original condition, potentially leading to incorrect results for complex numbers where `b` is non-zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `a` is equal to 1 instead of checking if `b` is zero, which would change the logic of the function and could lead to unexpected results for complex numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is zero, which is a different condition than checking if `b` is zero, potentially leading to incorrect handling of complex numbers where the real and imaginary parts are not independently evaluated.

DONE.
