  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(thisIter.next().retain)
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` is a property of the `Op` object, but it is not a function and cannot be called like one. This would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(thisIter.next().insert)
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` is a property of the `Op` object, but it is not a function and cannot be called like one. This would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(thisIter.next().delete)
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a property of the `Op` object, but it is not a function and cannot be called like one. This would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
