  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER> + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Number` is a constructor function that returns an object representing a number value, while the modified code fragment `<PLACEHOLDER> + 1` is an expression that adds 1 to the value of the variable `PLACEHOLDER`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER> - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Number` is a constructor function that returns an object representing a number value, while the modified code fragment `<PLACEHOLDER> - 1` is an expression that subtracts 1 from the value of the variable `PLACEHOLDER`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER> * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Number` is a constructor function that returns an object representing a number
