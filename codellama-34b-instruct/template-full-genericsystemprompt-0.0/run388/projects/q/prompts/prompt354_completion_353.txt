  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `reject` would cause the promise to be resolved with a rejection reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` would cause the promise to be resolved with a value, whereas `reject` would cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected with a rejection reason, whereas `reject` would cause the promise to be resolved with a rejection reason.

DONE.
