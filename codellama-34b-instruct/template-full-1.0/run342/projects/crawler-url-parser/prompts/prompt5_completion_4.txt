_has_illegal_chars(parsedUrl.href)

This would result in different behavior because the `_has_illegal_chars` function expects a string as its input, but `parsedUrl.href` is an object. This would cause the function to return undefined, which would cause the if statement to evaluate to false and the code inside the if statement to be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.search.includes(baseUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because `parsedUrl.search` is a string and `base
