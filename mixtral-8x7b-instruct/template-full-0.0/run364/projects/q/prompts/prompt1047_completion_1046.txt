 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return `null` instead of throwing an error when the queue is closed. This could cause unexpected behavior in the code that consumes the queue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return an empty object instead of throwing an error when the queue is closed. This could cause unexpected behavior in the code that consumes the queue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return a resolved promise instead of throwing an error when the queue is closed. This could cause unexpected behavior in the code that consumes the queue, especially if it is expecting an error to be thrown.

DONE.
