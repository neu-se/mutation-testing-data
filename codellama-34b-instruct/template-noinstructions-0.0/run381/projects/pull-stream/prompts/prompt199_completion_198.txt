  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` would cause the `read` function to be called with an error, while the new code fragment `null` would cause the `read` function to be called with no error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` would cause the `read` function to be called with an error, while the new code fragment `undefined` would cause the `read` function to be called with no error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('abort')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` would cause the `read` function to be called with an error, while the new code fragment `new Error('abort')` would cause the `read` function to be called with a different error.

DONE.
