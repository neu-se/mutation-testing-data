  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the presence of the `aborted` property, while this change checks for the presence of a non-null value. This could potentially cause the tested code to behave differently in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var aborted = <please insert buggy code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the presence of the `aborted` property, while this change defines a new variable with the same name but a different value. This could potentially cause the tested code to behave differently in some cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the presence of the `aborted` property, while this change tries to convert the value of `aborted` to a string using the `toString()` method. Depending on the type of the `aborted` property, this
