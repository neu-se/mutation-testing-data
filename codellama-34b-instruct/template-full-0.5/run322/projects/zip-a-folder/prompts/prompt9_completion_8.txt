  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isGlob` function returns `true` if the input is a glob pattern, and `false` otherwise. Using `isGlob(src)` would cause the code to enter the `if` block if `src` is a glob pattern, which is the opposite of the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.includes('*')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `includes` method checks if the input string contains a certain substring. In this case, it would check if `src` contains an asterisk, which is not the same as checking if it is a glob pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.indexOf('*') !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `indexOf` method returns the index of the first occurrence of the input string in the search string. If `src` contains an asterisk, it
