  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` to create a callback that is passed to `setTimeout`, which is then used to reject the promise with the error. In contrast, the modified code fragment would reject the promise with the error immediately, without waiting for the timeout to expire.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` to create a callback that is passed to `setTimeout`, which is then used to resolve the promise with the error. In contrast, the modified code fragment would resolve the promise with the error immediately, without waiting for the timeout to expire.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` to create
