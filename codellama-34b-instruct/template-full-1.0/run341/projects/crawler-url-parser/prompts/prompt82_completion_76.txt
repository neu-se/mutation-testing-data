  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it will return the href attribute of the anchor element, which is the original behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).children().attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it will return the href attribute of the first child element of the anchor element, which may not be the same as the original behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).parent().attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it will return the href attribute of the parent element of the anchor element, which may not be the same as the original behavior of the code.

DONE.
