  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is an object, and `!==` checks for strict equality, so the condition would evaluate to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a == 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is an object, and `==` checks for loose equality, so the condition would evaluate to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.constructor === Object
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is an object, and `constructor` is a property of the `Object` prototype, so the condition would evaluate to `true`.

DONE.
