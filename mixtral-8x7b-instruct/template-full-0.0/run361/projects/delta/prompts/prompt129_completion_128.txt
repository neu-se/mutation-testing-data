 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
iter.next || function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a falsy value (a no-op function) that would bypass the conditional check and insert a `<PLACEHOLDER>` object instead of the actual operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
iter.skip
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reference a non-existent `skip` method, causing a runtime error and breaking the execution flow.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
iter.next.bind(iter)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a bound function, changing the context of the `next` method. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the `next` method relies on the correct context (`this` value) to function properly.

DONE.
