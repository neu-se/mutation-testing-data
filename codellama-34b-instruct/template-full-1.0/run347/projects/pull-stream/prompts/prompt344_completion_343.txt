  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```diff
- onAbort
+ !onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort` is a boolean value and `!onAbort` is the negation of that value. If `onAbort` is `true`, then `!onAbort` would be `false`, and if `onAbort` is `false`, then `!onAbort` would be `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```diff
- onAbort
+ abort
```
This would result in different behavior because `abort` is a completely different variable than `onAbort`. Even if `abort` and `onAbort` have the same initial value, they are not guaranteed to have the same value in the future.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```diff
- onAbort
+ onAbort()
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort()` is a function call that has a side effect (such
