  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method is only called when the promise is rejected, so the `onUnhandledError` function would not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progress
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method is only called when the promise is fulfilled or rejected, so the `onUnhandledError` function would not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method is only called when the promise is fulfilled or rejected, so the `onUnhandledError` function would not be called.

DONE.
