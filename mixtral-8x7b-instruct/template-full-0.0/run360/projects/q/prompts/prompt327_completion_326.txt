 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the fallback function would receive an empty array as the second argument instead of the actual `<PLACEHOLDER>`. This could cause the fallback function to behave differently, especially if it relies on the arguments passed to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the fallback function would receive `null` as the second argument instead of the actual `<PLACEHOLDER>`. This could cause the fallback function to behave differently, especially if it checks for the presence or type of the arguments passed to it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{op: 'some_random_op'}
```
This would result in different behavior because the fallback function would receive an object with a random `op` property instead of the actual `<PLACEHOLDER>`. This could cause the fallback function to behave differently,
