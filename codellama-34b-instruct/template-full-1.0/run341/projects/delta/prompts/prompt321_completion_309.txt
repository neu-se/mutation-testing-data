  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would evaluate to `true` for any `op` that has a `retain` property that is an object or non-null value, whereas the modified code would only evaluate to `true` if `retain` is `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete === 'not_a_delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would evaluate to `true` for any `op` that has a `delete` property with a truthy value, whereas the modified code would only evaluate to `true` if `delete` is the string `'not_a_delete'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain !== '123'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would evaluate to `true` for any `op` that has a `retain` property that is not the number 1
