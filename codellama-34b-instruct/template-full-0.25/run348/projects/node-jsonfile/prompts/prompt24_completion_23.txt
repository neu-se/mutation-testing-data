  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(content, options.reviver || null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` function is not being passed to `JSON.parse` in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(content, options.reviver || (key, value) => value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` function is not being passed to `JSON.parse` in the original code, and the default `reviver` function is not being used.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(content, options.reviver || (key, value) => value + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` function is not being passed to `JSON.parse` in the original code, and the default `reviver` function is not being used. Additionally, the `reviver` function is
