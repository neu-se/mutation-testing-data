  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chiles'
```
This would result in different behavior because the correct plural form of "chili" is "chilies", not "chiles".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cilia'
```
This would result in different behavior because the correct plural form of "chili" is "chilies", not "cilia".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chili'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be adding the rule for the plural form of "chili" to be the same as the singular form, which is not correct.

DONE.
