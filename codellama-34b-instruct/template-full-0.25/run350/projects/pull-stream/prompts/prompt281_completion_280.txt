  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!mapper
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT, which would negate the value of `mapper`, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` regardless of the value of `mapper`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator is an addition operator, which would add 1 to the value of `mapper`, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` regardless of the value of `mapper`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator is a multiplication operator, which would multiply the value of `mapper` by 2, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` regardless of the value of `mapper`.

DONE.
