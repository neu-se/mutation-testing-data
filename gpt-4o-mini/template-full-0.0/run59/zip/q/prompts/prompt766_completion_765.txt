Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Promise rejected");
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of silently ignoring the promise's rejection, it would throw an error, causing the entire operation to fail immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return promise.value;
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to access a `value` property on the promise, which may not exist, leading to an undefined value being returned instead of the intended behavior of handling the promise correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return promise.then(null, noop);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the handling of the promise's rejection by passing `null` as the fulfillment handler, which could lead to unhandled promise rejections if the promise is fulfilled, while still calling `noop` on rejection.

DONE.
