  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is called instead of `fulfill`, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfill(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is passed as the fulfillment value instead of `value`, which could cause issues if the promise is expected to fulfill with a specific value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfill(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is passed as the fulfillment value instead of `value`, which could cause issues if the promise is expected to fulfill with a specific value.

DONE.
