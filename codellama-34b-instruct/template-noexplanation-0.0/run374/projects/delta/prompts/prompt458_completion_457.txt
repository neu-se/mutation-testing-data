  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset = 1;
```
This change will cause the `rest()` method to return a different result than the original code, as it will start from the second element of the `ops` array instead of the first.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index = this.ops.length - 1;
```
This change will cause the `rest()` method to return a different result than the original code, as it will start from the last element of the `ops` array instead of the first.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset = -1;
```
This change will cause the `rest()` method to return a different result than the original code, as it will start from the last element of the `ops` array instead of the first.

DONE.
