  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` is a property of `op.attributes`, not `op.attributes` itself, and it is not a valid argument for the `invert` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` is a property of `op.attributes`, not `op.attributes` itself, and it is not a valid argument for the `invert` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a property of `op.attributes`, not `op.attributes` itself, and it is not a valid argument for the `invert` method.

DONE.
