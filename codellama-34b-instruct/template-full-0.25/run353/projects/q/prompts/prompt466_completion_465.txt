  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for inequality, while `===` checks for equality. In this case, the code would check if `atReport` is equal to -1, rather than checking if it is not equal to -1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `>` operator checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand, while `!==` checks for inequality. In this case, the code would check if `atReport` is greater than -1, rather than checking if it is not equal to -1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport < -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<` operator checks if the left operand is less than the right operand, while `!==` checks for inequality. In this case, the code would check if `atReport
