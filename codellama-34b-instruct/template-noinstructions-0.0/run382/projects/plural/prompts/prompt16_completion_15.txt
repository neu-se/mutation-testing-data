  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `0, w.length - 1` would return the substring from the beginning of the word to the second-to-last letter, while the new code fragment `w.length - 2` would return the substring from the beginning of the word to the third-to-last letter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `0, w.length - 1` would return the substring from the beginning of the word to the second-to-last letter, while the new code fragment `w.length - 3` would return the substring from the beginning of the word to the fourth-to-last letter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 4
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `0, w.length - 1
