  DONE.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Op.length` method is used to determine the length of an `Op` object, whereas `0` is a constant value that would always return 0, regardless of the length of the `Op` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because `Infinity` is a special value in JavaScript that represents infinity, whereas `Op.length` is a method that returns the length of an `Op` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because `-1` is a constant value that would always return -1, regardless of the length of the `Op` object.
