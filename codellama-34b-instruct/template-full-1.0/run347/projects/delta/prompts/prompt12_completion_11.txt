  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
a[key] == undefined && b[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `==` operator checks for equality after coercing the types of the operands, whereas the `!==` operator checks for equality without coercing the types. In this case, it's possible that the value stored in `a[key]` is not the same type as the value stored in `b[key]`, which would result in different behavior when using the `==` operator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
a[key] === undefined || b[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if either `a[key]` or `b[key]` is undefined, whereas the original code fragment only checks if `a[key]` is undefined and `b[key]` is not undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!(a[key] !== undefined && b[key] === undefined
