  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because the protocol property is different from the original URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.hostname
```
This would result in different behavior because the hostname property is different from the original URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because the pathname property is different from the original URL.

DONE.
