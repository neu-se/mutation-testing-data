  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the sine of the argument instead of the cosine, which is used in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.PI * Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra multiplication by `Math.PI` to the argument, which would affect the final result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cos(2 * Math.asin(arg))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra step to the calculation, which would cause the result to be different from the original code.

DONE.
