 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.verbs.hasOwnProperty(verb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the existence of the verb key in the verbs object using the `hasOwnProperty` method, instead of checking if the verb key is not in the verbs object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(this.verbs).includes(verb)
