  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "undefined" || typeof self !== "undefined" || typeof global !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an additional check for the presence of the `global` variable, which may not be defined in all environments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "undefined" || typeof self !== "undefined" || typeof this !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an additional check for the presence of the `this` variable, which may not be defined in all environments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "undefined" || typeof self !== "undefined" || typeof process !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an additional check for the presence of the `process` variable, which may not be defined in all environments.

DONE.
