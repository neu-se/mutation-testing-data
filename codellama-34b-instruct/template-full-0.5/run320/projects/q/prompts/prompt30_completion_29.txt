  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift()` removes the first element from the array, whereas `pop()` removes the last element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `length` is a property that returns the number of elements in the array, whereas `pop()` removes the last element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.slice(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a shallow copy of a portion of the array, whereas `pop()` removes the last element.

DONE.
