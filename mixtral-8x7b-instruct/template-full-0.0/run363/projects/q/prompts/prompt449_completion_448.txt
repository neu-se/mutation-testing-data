 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unhandledRejections` array would end up containing `null` values, which could cause issues when processing unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unhandledRejections` array would end up containing empty objects, which could cause issues when processing unhandled rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unhandledRejections` array would end up containing resolved promises, which could cause issues when processing unhandled rejections.

DONE.
