  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc + data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would concatenate the values of `acc` and `data` instead of reducing them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc - data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator would subtract the value of `data` from `acc` instead of reducing them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc * data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would multiply the values of `acc` and `data` instead of reducing them.

DONE.
