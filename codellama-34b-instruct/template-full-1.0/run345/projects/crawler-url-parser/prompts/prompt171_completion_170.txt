  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_subdomain_len > pageurl_subdomain_len
```
This would result in different behavior because the operator ">" checks if the length of the subdomain of the link URL is greater than the length of the subdomain of the page URL, which is not the same as checking if the length of the subdomain of the link URL is less than the length of the subdomain of the page URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_subdomain_len != pageurl_subdomain_len
```
This would result in different behavior because the operator "!=" checks if the length of the subdomain of the link URL is not equal to the length of the subdomain of the page URL, which is not the same as checking if the length of the subdomain of the link URL is less than the length of the subdomain of the page URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_subdomain_len === pageurl_subdomain_len
