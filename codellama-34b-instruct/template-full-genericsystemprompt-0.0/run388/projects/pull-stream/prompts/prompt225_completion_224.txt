  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filterNot
```
This would result in different behavior because `filterNot` is a different function than `filter`, and it would return a negated version of the test result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester
```
This would result in different behavior because `tester` is a different function than `filter`, and it would return a different result based on the input data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data => !test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the result of the `test` function, which is different from the original code that simply returns the result of the `test` function.

DONE.
