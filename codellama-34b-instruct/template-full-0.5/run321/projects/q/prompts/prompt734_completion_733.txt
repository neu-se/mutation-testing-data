  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` expects an array of promises, but `[]` is an empty array, which would cause the function to return a promise that is already resolved with an empty array, instead of waiting for the promises to settle.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` expects an array of promises, but `null` is not an array, which would cause the function to throw an error when trying to iterate over the non-array value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` expects an array of promises, but `undefined` is not an array, which would cause the function to throw an error when trying to iterate over the non-array value.

DONE.
