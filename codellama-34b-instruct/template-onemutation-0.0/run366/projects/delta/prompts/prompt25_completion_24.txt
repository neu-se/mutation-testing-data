  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `===` operator, which checks for both value and type equality, while the new code fragment uses the `!==` operator, which checks for value inequality only. This means that the new code fragment would return `true` for values that are not equal, but have the same type, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the `diff` function.

DONE.
