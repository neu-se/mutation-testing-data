  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect().state
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.inspect().state` would return the state of the promise, which is not the same as `this.inspect()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect().fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.inspect().fulfilled` would return the fulfilled value of the promise, which is not the same as `this.inspect()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect().rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.inspect().rejected` would return the rejected reason of the promise, which is not the same as `this.inspect()`.

DONE.
