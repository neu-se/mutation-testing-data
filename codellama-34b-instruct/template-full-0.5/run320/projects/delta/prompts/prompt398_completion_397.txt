  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.retain` is a different object than `otherOp`, and the code expects `otherOp` to be an object with a `retain` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.delete` is a different object than `otherOp`, and the code expects `otherOp` to be an object with a `delete` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.insert` is a different object than `otherOp`, and the code expects `otherOp` to be an object with an `insert` property.

DONE.
