  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3].slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that returns a slice of an array, while `[1, 2, 3].slice()` is a method that creates a new array containing a section of the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"array_slice"
```
This would result in different behavior because "array_slice" is a string, not a function, and it would return the string itself, not a slice of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(123)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that returns a slice of an array, while `Math.sin(123)` is a mathematical function that returns the sine of 123, which is a number.

DONE.
