  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws an error if the queue is closed, while the new code fragment would return `null` instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws an error if the queue is closed, while the new code fragment would return `undefined` instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("Queue is closed"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws an error if the queue is closed, while the new code fragment would return a rejected promise with a custom error message instead.

DONE.
