  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `destroy()` method is used to immediately destroy the stream, whereas the original code uses the `end()` method to end the stream gracefully. This could cause the stream to be destroyed before all data has been written to it, resulting in data loss.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.close()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close()` method is used to close the stream, whereas the original code uses the `end()` method to end the stream gracefully. This could cause the stream to be closed before all data has been written to it, resulting in data loss.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroySoon()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `destroySoon()` method is used to destroy the stream as soon as possible, whereas the original code uses the `end()` method to end the stream gracefully.
