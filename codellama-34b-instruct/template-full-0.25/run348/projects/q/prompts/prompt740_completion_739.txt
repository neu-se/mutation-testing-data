  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer(null)` creates a new deferred object with a null promise, whereas `Q.defer` creates a new deferred object with a promise that is not resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer(undefined)` creates a new deferred object with an undefined promise, whereas `Q.defer` creates a new deferred object with a promise that is not resolved or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer(Q.reject())
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer(Q.reject())` creates a new deferred object with a rejected promise, whereas `Q.defer` creates a new deferred object with a promise that is not resolved or rejected.

DONE.
