  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(ops)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` for `ops` that are not arrays, even if they have an `ops` property that is an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops instanceof Array
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` for `ops` that are not arrays, even if they have an `ops` property that is an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.ops instanceof Array
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` for `ops` that do not have an `ops` property that is an array, even if they are arrays themselves.

DONE.
