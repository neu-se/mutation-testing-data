  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
untrackRejection(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `untrackRejection(rejection)` line would be called with the current promise object (`this`), which is not what the developer intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackRejection(this, reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `untrackRejection(rejection)` line would not be called, which would cause the unhandled rejection to remain untracked.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
untrackRejection(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `untrackRejection(rejection)` line would be called with a different argument (`promise`) than the developer intended.

DONE.
