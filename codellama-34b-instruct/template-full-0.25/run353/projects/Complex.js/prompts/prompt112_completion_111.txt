  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `add` method to always return the real part of the complex number, rather than the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `add` method to always return a complex number with a real part of 0 and an imaginary part that is 1 greater than the original complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `add` method to always return a complex number with a real part of 0 and an imaginary part that is twice the original complex number.

DONE.
