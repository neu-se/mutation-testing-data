  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray(array)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isArray` checks if the argument is an array, while `!Array.isArray` checks if the argument is not an array. This change would cause the function to return a different value for arrays and non-arrays.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isArray` checks if the argument is an array, while `array.length === 0` checks if the array is empty. This change would cause the function to return a different value for empty arrays and non-empty arrays.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.some(function(element) { return element === undefined; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isArray` checks if the argument is an array, while `array.some` checks if any element in the array satisfies the provided condition.
