  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `array` is an array, and `array.length` returns the number of elements in the array. However, `array.length - 1` would return the number of elements minus one, which could cause the loop to skip the last element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `array` is an array, and `array.length` returns the number of elements in the array. However, `array.length + 1` would return the number of elements plus one, which could cause the loop to iterate one extra time and potentially access an element that does not exist.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `array` is an array, and `array.length` returns the
