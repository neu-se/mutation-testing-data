Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
longitude < -360 || longitude > 360
```
This would result in different behavior because it allows longitudes outside the valid range of -180 to 180, potentially accepting invalid longitude values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
longitude <= -180 || longitude >= 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it allows longitudes that are exactly -180 or 180, which are typically considered valid in some contexts, but not in this implementation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
latitude < -180 || latitude > 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly checks the latitude variable instead of the longitude variable, leading to erroneous validation of the longitude value.

DONE.
