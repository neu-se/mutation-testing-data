  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be a negation of the original value, which would result in a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be using a different trigonometric function, which would produce a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cbrt
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be using a different mathematical function, which would produce a different output.

DONE.
