 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'persons'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns 'person' for the input 'person', while this change would return 'persons'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w + 'e' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would add an 'e' instead of the correct plural form 'people'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'en' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would incorrectly change the last letter to 'n' instead of adding 'e' or 's' based on the word.

DONE.
