Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `AttributeMap.invert` function to receive `null` instead of the actual attributes, potentially leading to incorrect attribute handling or errors during the inversion process.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would default to an empty object if `op.attributes` is `undefined`, which may change the logic of how attributes are processed and could lead to unintended retention of attributes that should have been inverted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ ...op.attributes }
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of the attributes object, which may lead to unexpected results if the original attributes object is modified later in the code, as the inversion logic would be working with a copy rather than the original reference.

DONE.
