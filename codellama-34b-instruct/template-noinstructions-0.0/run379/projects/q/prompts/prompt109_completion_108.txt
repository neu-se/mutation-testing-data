  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1; i <= this.length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at 1 instead of 0, potentially skipping the first element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i < this.length - 1; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would stop at the second-to-last element in the array instead of the last element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i < this.length / 2; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only iterate over half of the elements in the array.

DONE.
