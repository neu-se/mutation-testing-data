  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host != null || baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because the logical OR operator `||` is used instead of the logical AND operator `&&`, which would change the condition for the `if` statement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host != null && baseUrlStr == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition checks if the `baseUrlStr` is `null` instead of not `null`, which would change the logic of the `if` statement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition checks the length of `baseUrlStr` instead of its value, which would change the logic of the `if` statement.

DONE.
