  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is case-sensitive, while the new code fragment is not. This could cause the policy to allow actions that it should not, or deny actions that it should.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking the entire path, while the new code fragment is only checking the last segment of the path. This could cause the policy to allow actions that it should not, or deny actions that it should.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.replace(/[^\w]/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking the entire path, while the new code fragment is only checking the path after removing all non-word characters. This could cause the policy to allow actions that it should not, or deny actions that it should.
