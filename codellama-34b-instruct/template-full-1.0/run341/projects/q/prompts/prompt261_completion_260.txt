  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation operator would return true if `resolvedPromise` is falsey, and false if it is truthy. The original code fragment would only reject the promise if `resolvedPromise` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise == false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `==` operator would check if `resolvedPromise` is equal to `false`, whereas the original code fragment would only check if `resolvedPromise` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.contains(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.contains()` method checks if the array or string contains the specified value, whereas the original code fragment would only check if `resolvedPromise` is truthy.

DONE.
