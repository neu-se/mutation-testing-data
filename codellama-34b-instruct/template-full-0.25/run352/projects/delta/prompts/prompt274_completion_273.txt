  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next operation is an insertion, while this replacement checks if it is a retention.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType() !== 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next operation is an insertion or a retention, while this replacement checks if it is not a deletion.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType() === 'insert' && iter.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next operation is an insertion, while this replacement checks if it is an insertion with a non-zero length.

DONE.
