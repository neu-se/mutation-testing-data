  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err === false ? null : err, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `null` if `err` is equal to `false`, instead of returning `null` if `err` is equal to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err !== null ? err : null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `err` if it is not equal to `null`, instead of returning `null` if `err` is equal to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err == null ? null : err
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `null` if `err` is equal to `null`, instead of returning `null` if `err` is equal to `true`.

DONE.
