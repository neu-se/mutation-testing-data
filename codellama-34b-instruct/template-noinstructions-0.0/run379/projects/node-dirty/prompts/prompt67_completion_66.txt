  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(() => this._writeStream.destroy(new Error('Intentional error')));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `destroy` method is called with an error, which would cause the write stream to be destroyed with an error, rather than being destroyed without an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(() => this._writeStream.destroy(null));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `destroy` method is called with `null` instead of an error, which would cause the write stream to be destroyed without an error, rather than being destroyed with an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(() => this._writeStream.destroy());
```
This would result in different behavior because the `destroy` method is called without any arguments, which would cause the write stream to be destroyed without an error, rather than being destroyed with an error.

DONE.
