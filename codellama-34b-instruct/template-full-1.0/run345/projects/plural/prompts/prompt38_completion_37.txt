  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix$|index/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match "appendix" only at the end of the string, rather than anywhere in the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/index$|appendix/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match "index" only at the end of the string, rather than anywhere in the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|index/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match "appendix" or "index" anywhere in the string, regardless of case.

DONE.
