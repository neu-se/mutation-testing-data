  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the function checks whether `this['im']` is equal to 0, while replacing it with `a === 0` would check whether `a` is equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the function checks whether `this['isZero']()` is true, while replacing it with `z['isInfinite']` would check whether `z` is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the function checks whether `this['im']` is equal to 0, while replacing it with `z['im'] === 0` would check whether `z['im']` is equal to 0.

DONE.
