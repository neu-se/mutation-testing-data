  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.merge
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.merge` is not a valid JavaScript method, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.assign({}, prev, { [id]: getCountry(id, options) });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new object using the `Object.assign` method, which is not the same as the original code that uses the `Object.assign` method without passing any arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev[id] = getCountry(id, options);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the result of `getCountry(id, options)` directly to the `prev` object, without creating a new object using the `Object.assign` method.

DONE.
