  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(2).attributes || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip over the first character of the line and consider the second character instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(1).attributes || iter.next(1).attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider the attributes of the second character instead of the first.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(1).attributes || iter.next(2).attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider the attributes of the second character if the first character did not have any attributes.

DONE.
