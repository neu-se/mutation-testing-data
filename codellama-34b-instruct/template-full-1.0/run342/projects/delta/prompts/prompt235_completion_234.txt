  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(opLength + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to move to the next position before comparing the `thisOp` and `otherOp`, which could lead to incorrect results in the `diff` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter. skipto(opLength)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to skip over the next `opLength` positions before comparing the `thisOp` and `otherOp`, which could lead to incorrect results in the `diff` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.copytodelta(opLength)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to copy the next `opLength` positions to a new `Delta` object before comparing the `thisOp` and `otherOp`, which could lead to incorrect results in the `diff` function.
