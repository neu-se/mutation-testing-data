  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\s*(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of the `\s*` at the start would allow for leading whitespace, leading to different matching behavior for some inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)|^\s+\^*/
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of `|^\s+\^*` at the end would also match if the string starts with whitespace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)|^\s*?/
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of `?` at the end would make the leading whitespace optional, leading to different matching behavior for some inputs.

DONE.
