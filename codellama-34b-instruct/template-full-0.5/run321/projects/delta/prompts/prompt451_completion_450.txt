  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index < this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasNext()` method is checking if there are any more ops in the iterator, while the replacement code is checking if the current index is less than the length of the ops array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index >= this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasNext()` method is checking if there are any more ops in the iterator, while the replacement code is checking if the current index is greater than or equal to the length of the ops array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index == this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasNext()` method is checking if there are any more ops in the iterator, while the replacement code is checking if the current index is equal to the length of the ops array.

DONE.
