  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the status code is never expected to be -1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode !== 404
```
This would result in different behavior because the status code is expected to be 404 for a "not found" response.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!res.ok
```
This would result in different behavior because the res.ok property is true if the status code is 200.

DONE.
