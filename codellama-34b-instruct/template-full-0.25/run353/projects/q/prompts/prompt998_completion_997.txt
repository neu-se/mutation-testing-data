  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(null));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed a function as an argument to `makeNodeResolver`, while this new code fragment passes `null`. This would cause the `makeNodeResolver` function to return a different value, which would then be used as the last argument to `dispatch`, leading to different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(undefined));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed a function as an argument to `makeNodeResolver`, while this new code fragment passes `undefined`. This would cause the `makeNodeResolver` function to return a different value, which would then be used as the last argument to `dispatch`, leading to different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(function() {}));
```
This would result in different
