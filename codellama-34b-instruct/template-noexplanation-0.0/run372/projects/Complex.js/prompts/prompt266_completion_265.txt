  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a, b
```
This change swaps the order of the arguments, which could potentially cause issues if the function is not designed to handle this case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This change adds the two arguments together, which could also potentially cause issues if the function is not designed to handle this case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This change multiplies the two arguments together, which could also potentially cause issues if the function is not designed to handle this case.

DONE.
