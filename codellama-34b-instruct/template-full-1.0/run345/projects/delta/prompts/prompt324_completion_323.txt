  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - length
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the slice would be negative, which would cause the slice to return an empty delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex << 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the shift operator would return a value that is twice the original base index, which would cause the slice to start from a different position in the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(baseIndex)
```
This would result in different behavior because the absolute value of the base index would be returned, which would cause the slice to start from a different position in the delta if the base index is negative.

DONE.
