  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.warn !== console.log
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.warn` and `console.log` are different methods on the `console` object, and replacing them with each other would change the behavior of the `deprecate` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof console.warn === "function" && console.warn("Hello, world!")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `console.warn` method with the argument `"Hello, world!"`, which would cause a different warning message to be printed to the console.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.warn === "function" && console.warn("Goodbye, world!")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `console.warn` method with the argument `"Goodbye, world!"`, which would cause a different warning message to be printed to the console.

DONE.
