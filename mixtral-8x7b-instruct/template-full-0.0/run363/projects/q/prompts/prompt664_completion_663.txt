 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object cannot be sliced using `array_slice`, and using `null` would cause an error in the `<PLACEHOLDER>(arguments, 1)` call.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { return 42; }
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of passing the remaining arguments to the `dispatch` method, it would pass the result of the function (which is always `42`), leading to incorrect invocation of the `post` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.keys(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys(arguments)` returns an array of the enumerable property names of the arguments object, not the actual arguments. This would cause the `post` method to be called with an incorrect set of arguments, leading to unexpected behavior.
