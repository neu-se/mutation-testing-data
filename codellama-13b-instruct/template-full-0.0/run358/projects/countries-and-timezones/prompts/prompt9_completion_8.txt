  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `countries` array is now being compared to the length of the array, rather than the array itself. This could potentially cause the `forEach` loop to not execute, which could result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!countries.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `countries` array is now being negated, which could result in the `forEach` loop not executing. This could potentially cause different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `countries` array is now being compared to a positive number, rather than the array itself. This could potentially cause the `forEach` loop to execute, which could result in different behavior.

DONE.
