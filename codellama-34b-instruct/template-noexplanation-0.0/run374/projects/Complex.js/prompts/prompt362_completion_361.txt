  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This change will cause the `sinh` function to return a different value than the original code, which could potentially cause issues in the `tanh` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This change will cause the `sinh` function to return a different value than the original code, which could potentially cause issues in the `tanh` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This change will cause the `sinh` function to return a different value than the original code, which could potentially cause issues in the `tanh` function.

DONE.
