  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the index would be initialized with a value of 1 instead of 0, which would result in a different execution path for the loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = ctx.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the index would be initialized with a value that is not 0, which would result in a different execution path for the loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index: number
```
This would result in different behavior because the index would be initialized with a value that is not 0, which would result in a different execution path for the loop.

DONE.
