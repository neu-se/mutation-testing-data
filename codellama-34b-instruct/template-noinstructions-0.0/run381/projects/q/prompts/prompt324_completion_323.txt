  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("PLACEHOLDER");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to reject with the error "PLACEHOLDER", whereas the original code would have called the `fallback` function with the `op` and `args` arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(new Error("PLACEHOLDER"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to reject with the error "PLACEHOLDER", whereas the original code would have called the `fallback` function with the `op` and `args` arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return resolve(new Error("PLACEHOLDER"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to resolve with the error "PLACEHOLDER", whereas the original code would have called the `fallback` function with the `op` and `args` arguments.
