  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.ops.push(newOp)` is a different operation than `ops`, which is the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.concat(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because `ops.concat(newOp)` concatenates the `ops` array with `newOp`, while the original code fragment pushes `newOp` onto the `ops` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.splice(ops.length, 0, newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because `ops.splice(ops.length, 0, newOp)` inserts `newOp` at the end of the `ops` array, while the original code fragment pushes `newOp` onto the `ops` array.

DONE.
