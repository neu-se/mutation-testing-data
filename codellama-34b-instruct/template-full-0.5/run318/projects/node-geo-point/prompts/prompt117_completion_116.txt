  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDestination` method expects a `GeoPoint` object as its first argument, but `null` is not a valid `GeoPoint` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new GeoPoint(0, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDestination` method expects a `GeoPoint` object with non-zero latitude and longitude values, but `new GeoPoint(0, 0)` creates a `GeoPoint` object with zero latitude and longitude values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDestination` method expects a `GeoPoint` object as its first argument, but `this` refers to the current `GeoPoint` object, which is not a valid argument for the method.

DONE.
