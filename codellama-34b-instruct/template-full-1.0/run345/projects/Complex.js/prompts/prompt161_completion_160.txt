  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```python
z['isZero']() || z['isInfinite']()) {
  return Complex['ZERO'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked `z['isZero']() && z['isInfinite']())`, which is a more specific condition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```python
z['isZero']() && z['isInfinite']()) {
  return Complex['ONE'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked `z['isZero']() || z['isInfinite']())`, which is a less specific condition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```python
z['isZero']() && z['isInfinite']()) {
  return Complex['NAN'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment did not include a check for the special case where `z['isZero']() && z['isInfinite']()`.

DONE
