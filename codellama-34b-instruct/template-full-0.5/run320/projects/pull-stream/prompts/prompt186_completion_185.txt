  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would call the `cb` function with the value `true`, while the modified code fragment would call it with the value `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(array[i++])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would call the `cb` function with the value `array[i++]`, while the modified code fragment would call it with the value `array[i++]` and then increment `i` by 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(array[i + 1])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would call the `cb` function with the value `array[i++]`, while the modified code fragment would call it with the value `array[i + 1]`.

DONE.
