 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$('body')
```
This would result in different behavior because it selects the `<body>` element instead of the current `<a>` element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$(this).parent()
```
This would result in different behavior because it selects the parent element of the current `<a>` element instead of the text inside the `<a>` element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'some text'
```
This would result in different behavior because it always sets the `text` variable to the string 'some text' instead of the actual text inside the `<a>` element.

DONE.
