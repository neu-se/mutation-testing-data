  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-cosh
```
This will negate the result of the `cosh` function, which will cause the `cos` function to return the wrong value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh
```
This will replace the `cosh` function with the `sinh` function, which will cause the `cos` function to return the wrong value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tanh
```
This will replace the `cosh` function with the `tanh` function, which will cause the `cos` function to return the wrong value.

DONE.
