  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field, false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed `true` as the second argument to the `unique` function, which means that the function would return the item only if it was unique. Replacing `true` with `false` would cause the function to return the item regardless of whether it was unique or not, which would result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field, field
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed `true` as the second argument to the `unique` function, which means that the function would return the item only if it was unique. Replacing `true` with `field` would cause the function to return the item only if it was unique, but it would also cause the function to return the item regardless of whether it was the same as the previous item or not, which would result in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field, !field
```
