  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` method to return a `null` value, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior in the surrounding code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` method to return an `undefined` value, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior in the surrounding code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` method to return a function that does nothing, which would likely cause the surrounding code to behave differently.

DONE.
