  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` performs a search for a substring within a string, rather than returning a match object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
regex.exec(path)
```
This would result in different behavior because `exec` performs a regular expression match, rather than checking for a match and returning a match object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.replace(regex, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because `replace` replaces the matched substring with an empty string, rather than returning a match object.

DONE.
