  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan` function would return a zero value, which is not the intended behavior of the `atan` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan` function would return `Infinity` for all inputs, which is not correct.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan` function would return `NaN` for all inputs, which is not correct.

DONE.
