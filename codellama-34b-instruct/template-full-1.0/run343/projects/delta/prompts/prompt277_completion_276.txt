  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.next()` advances the iterator and returns the next element, whereas `iter.peek()` only returns the next element without advancing the iterator. The surrounding code uses the returned value to concatenate the delta, so if the iterator is advanced, the resulting delta would be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek(length * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.peek(length * 2)` returns the next `length * 2` elements without advancing the iterator. The surrounding code uses the returned value to concatenate the delta, so if a different number of elements is returned, the resulting delta would be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next()` advances the other iterator and returns the next element, whereas `iter.peek()` only returns the
