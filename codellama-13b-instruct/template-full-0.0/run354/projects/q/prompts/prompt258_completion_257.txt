  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment resolves the promise with the value, while the new code fragment rejects the promise with the value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment resolves the promise with the value, while the new code fragment resolves the promise with a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment resolves the promise with the value, while the new code fragment resolves the promise with a rejected promise.

DONE.
