  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb
```
This would result in different behavior because `abortCb` is a function that takes two arguments, while `cb` is a function that takes one argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(aborted)
```
This would result in different behavior because `abortCb(aborted)` is a function call that passes the `aborted` argument to the `abortCb` function, while `cb` is a function that takes one argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(aborted, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because `abortCb(aborted, cb)` is a function call that passes the `aborted` and `cb` arguments to the `abortCb` function, while `cb` is a function that takes one argument.

DONE.
