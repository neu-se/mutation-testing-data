  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.acos` function returns the arc cosine of a number, whereas the original code fragment `acos` is a variable that is not defined in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.asin
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.asin` function returns the arc sine of a number, whereas the original code fragment `acos` is a variable that is not defined in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.atan` function returns the arc tangent of a number, whereas the original code fragment `acos` is a variable that is not defined in the code.

DONE.
