  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number(bearing) + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 180` would change the output of the `Number` function, potentially leading to a different bearing calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would change the output of the `bearing` variable, potentially leading to a different bearing calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number(bearing) * 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 360` would change the output of the `Number` function, potentially leading to a different bearing calculation.

DONE.
