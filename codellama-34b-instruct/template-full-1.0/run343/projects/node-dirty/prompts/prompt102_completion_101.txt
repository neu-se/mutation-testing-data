  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(row.key, [])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value associated with the given key to an empty array, rather than deleting the key-value pair.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.clear()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would clear the entire data structure, rather than just deleting the key-value pair for the given key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(row.key, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value associated with the given key to `undefined`, rather than deleting the key-value pair.

DONE.
