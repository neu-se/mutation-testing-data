  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick.bind(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` returns a new function that, when called, will have its `this` set to the first argument passed to `bind` (in this case, `undefined`). However, the original code does not pass any arguments to `bind`, so the returned function will still have `this` set to the global object (or `undefined` in strict mode).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick.apply(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` calls the function with a specified `this` value (in this case, `undefined`) and an array of arguments. However, the original code does not pass any arguments to `apply`, so the returned function will still have `this` set to the global object (or `undefined` in strict mode).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick.call(undefined)
```
This would result in different
