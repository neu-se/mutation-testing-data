Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.slice(0, inverted.length);
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` creates a shallow copy of the `inverted` object, which may not remove any unnecessary elements, unlike `chop`, which is likely intended to clean up or finalize the `Delta` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.retain(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because calling `retain(0)` would effectively do nothing to the `inverted` object, potentially leaving it in an incomplete state, whereas `chop` is expected to finalize the operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.push(new Delta());
```
This would result in different behavior because adding a new `Delta` object to `inverted` would change its contents, potentially introducing an empty operation, while `chop` is meant to finalize the current operations without adding new ones.

DONE.
