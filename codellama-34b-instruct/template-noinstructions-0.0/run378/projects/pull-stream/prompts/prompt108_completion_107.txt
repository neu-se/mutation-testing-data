  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `cb` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `cb` is strictly equal to `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof cb === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `cb` is truthy, while this new code fragment checks if `cb` is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb && typeof cb === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `cb` is truthy and a function, while this new code fragment checks if `cb` is a function and truthy.

DONE.
