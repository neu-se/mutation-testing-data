  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, acc)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is called with the arguments in reverse order, which could cause an error if the function is not designed to handle this case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is called with the arguments in a different order, which could cause an error if the function is not designed to handle this case.

DONE.
