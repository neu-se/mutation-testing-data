  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror(new Error("test error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Q.onerror` function to be called with a new error object, which would trigger the error handling logic in the `Q` library.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Q.onerror` function to be called with a null value, which would not trigger the error handling logic in the `Q` library.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Q.onerror` function to be called with an undefined value, which would not trigger the error handling logic in the `Q` library.

DONE.
