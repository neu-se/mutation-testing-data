  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref.pop` returns the last element of the array, while `ref.unshift` returns the first element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref.shift` returns the first element of the array, while `ref.unshift` returns the last element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref.slice(1)` returns a new array containing all elements except the first, while `ref.unshift` returns the first element.

DONE.
