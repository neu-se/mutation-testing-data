  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` would refer to the `Promise.prototype` object instead of `void 0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` would be passed as the `this` context to the `Q.denodeify.apply` method, instead of `void 0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty object would be passed as the `this` context to the `Q.denodeify.apply` method, instead of `void 0`.

DONE.
