 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always consider the `aborted` value as true, even if it hasn't been set, causing the function to terminate prematurely or behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the existence of an `aborted` property within the `data` object, rather than checking the `aborted` variable. This could lead to unexpected behavior or false negatives if the `data` object doesn't have the `aborted` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map.aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the `aborted` property of the `map` function, rather than the `aborted` variable. This could lead to unexpected behavior or false negatives if the `map` function doesn't have the `aborted` property.
