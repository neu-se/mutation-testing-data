Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the method being called from "post" to "get", which may not exist on the object and would lead to a different operation or an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, []]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the arguments passed to the method from `nodeArgs` (which contains the actual arguments) to an empty array, potentially causing the method to execute without the necessary parameters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, nodeArgs, "extraArg"]
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an additional argument "extraArg" to the method call, which may alter the expected behavior of the method being invoked.

DONE.
