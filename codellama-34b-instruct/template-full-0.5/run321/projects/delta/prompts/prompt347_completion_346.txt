  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOpData.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseOpData.length` is a number, whereas `baseOpData` is an object. This would cause the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function to throw an error, which would result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOpData[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseOpData[0]` is a string, whereas `baseOpData` is an object. This would cause the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function to return a different value, which would result in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOpData.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseOpData.slice(0, 1)` is an array, whereas `baseOpData` is an object. This would cause the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function to return a different value, which
