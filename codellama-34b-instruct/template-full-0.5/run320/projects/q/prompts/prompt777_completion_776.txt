  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect.foo
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.inspect` is an object, and accessing the `foo` property on it would return `undefined`, which would be a different value than what `promise.inspect` returns.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.inspect` is an object, and adding 1 to it would coerce it to a number, which would be a different value than what `promise.inspect` returns.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.inspect` is an object, and calling `toString()` on it would return a string representation of the object, which would be a different value than what `promise.inspect` returns.

DONE.
