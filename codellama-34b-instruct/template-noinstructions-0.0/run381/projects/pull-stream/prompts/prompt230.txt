Your task is to apply mutation testing to the following code:
```
'use strict'

var tester = require('../util/tester')

module.exports = function filter (test) {
  //regexp
  test = tester(<PLACEHOLDER>)
  return function (read) {
    return function next (end, cb) {
      var sync, loop = true
      while(loop) {
        loop = false
        sync = true
        read(end, function (end, data) {
          if(!end && !test(data))
            return sync ? loop = true : next(end, cb)
          cb(end, data)
        })
        sync = false
      }
    }
  }
}


```

by replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different
behavior than the original code fragment, which was:
```
test
```  

Provide three answers as fenced code blocks containing a single line of code,
using the following template:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Please conclude your response with "DONE."
