  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size && !this._waitForDrain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the `!this._waitForDrain` expression would be evaluated first. If `this._waitForDrain` is true, the entire expression would evaluate to false, even if `this._queue.size` is true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this._queue.size && this._waitForDrain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the `this._waitForDrain` expression would be evaluated first. If `this._waitForDrain` is false, the entire expression would evaluate to false, even if `this._queue.size` is true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size > 0 || this._waitForDrain
