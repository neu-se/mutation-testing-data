Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of `options` would cause the `fs.writeFileSync` method to not receive the intended options, potentially leading to unexpected file writing behavior or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` instead of `options` would also mean that the `fs.writeFileSync` method does not receive the intended options, which could lead to default behavior being applied instead of the specified options.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ encoding: 'utf8' }
```
This would result in different behavior because providing a hardcoded options object with a specific encoding would override any user-defined options, potentially leading to incorrect file encoding when writing the file.

DONE.
