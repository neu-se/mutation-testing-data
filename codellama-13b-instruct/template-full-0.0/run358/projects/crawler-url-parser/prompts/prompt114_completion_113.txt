  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl of urlMap.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys()` method returns an array of the keys in the Map object, whereas the `values()` method returns an array of the values in the Map object. In this case, the `keys()` method would return an array of URLs, whereas the `values()` method would return an array of objects with URL information.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl of urlMap.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `values()` method returns an array of the values in the Map object, whereas the `keys()` method returns an array of the keys in the Map object. In this case, the `values()` method would return an array of objects with URL information, whereas the `keys()` method would return an array of URLs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl of urlMap.entries()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `entries()`
