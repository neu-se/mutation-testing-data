 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'me'
```
This would result in different behavior because the rule added for the string 'memo' is replaced with a rule for the string 'me', which would incorrectly pluralize words like 'community' to 'communities'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/me$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/me$/i` would match words that end with 'me', but not the string 'memo', resulting in no rule being added for 'memo'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w + 'a' }
