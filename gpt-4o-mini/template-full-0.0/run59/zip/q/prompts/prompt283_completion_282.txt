Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass no arguments to the `self.resolve` function instead of the second argument, potentially causing the promise to resolve with `undefined` instead of the intended value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[1] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the second argument incremented by one to the `self.resolve` function, which could lead to unexpected values being resolved in the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the third argument to the `self.resolve` function, which would change the expected behavior when the number of arguments is greater than two, potentially leading to incorrect promise resolution.

DONE.
