  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(accum, curr, index) => accum + curr
```
This would result in different behavior because the accumulator would be initialized to `0` instead of `Infinity`, which would cause the reduce function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(accum, curr, index) => accum + curr.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the accumulator would be initialized to `0` instead of `Infinity`, which would cause the reduce function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(accum, curr, index) => accum + curr.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the accumulator would be initialized to `0` instead of `Infinity`, which would cause the reduce function to return a different value.

DONE.
