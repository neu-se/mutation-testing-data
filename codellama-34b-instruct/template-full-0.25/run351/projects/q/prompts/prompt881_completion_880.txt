  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` to create a callback function that would be called with the error as an argument, while this replacement would simply reject the promise with the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` to create a callback function that would be called with the error as an argument, while this replacement would simply resolve the promise with the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` to create a callback function that would be called with the error as an argument, while this replacement would simply notify the promise with the error.

DONE.
