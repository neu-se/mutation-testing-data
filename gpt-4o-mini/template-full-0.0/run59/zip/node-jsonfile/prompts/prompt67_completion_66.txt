Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a space character at the beginning of the string instead of removing the BOM, which could lead to incorrect parsing or formatting of the JSON content.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `null` instead of an empty string would change the type of the output, potentially causing issues when the result is used in further processing or when expected to be a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because returning the string `'undefined'` instead of an empty string would alter the content of the output, leading to incorrect data representation and possible errors in downstream processing.

DONE.
