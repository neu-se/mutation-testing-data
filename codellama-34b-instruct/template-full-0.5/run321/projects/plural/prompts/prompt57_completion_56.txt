  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
regex, 'ves'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `replace` method to replace the entire string with the value of the `regex` variable, rather than just the part of the string that matches the regular expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
regex.test(w), 'ves'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `replace` method to replace the entire string with the value of the `regex.test(w)` expression, rather than just the part of the string that matches the regular expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.match(regex), 'ves'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `replace` method to replace the entire string with the value of the `w.match(regex)` expression, rather than just the part of the string that matches the regular expression.

DONE.
