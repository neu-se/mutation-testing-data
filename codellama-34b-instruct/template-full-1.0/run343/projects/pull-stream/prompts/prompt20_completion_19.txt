  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `ref[1]` instead of `ref[0]` as the second argument to `pull`, which could potentially cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read + ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the sum of `read` and `ref[0]` as the second argument to `pull`, which could potentially cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read * ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the product of `read` and `ref[0]` as the second argument to `pull`, which could potentially cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
