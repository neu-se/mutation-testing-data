  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = !end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the value of `end`, which could cause the function to terminate prematurely or continue running indefinitely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = end && !test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only set `ended` to `true` if `end` is `true` and `test(data)` is `false`, which could cause the function to terminate prematurely or continue running indefinitely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = end || !test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set `ended` to `true` if `end` is `true` or `test(data)` is `false`, which could cause the function to terminate prematurely or continue running indefinitely.

DONE.
