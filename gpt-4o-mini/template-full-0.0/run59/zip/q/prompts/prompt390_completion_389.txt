Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return null; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `when` function to always resolve with `null` instead of calling the `rejected` callback, potentially leading to unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected.bind(null, "error");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always pass the string "error" to the `rejected` function, regardless of the actual exception that occurred, which could lead to misleading error handling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected.call(this, exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the context (`this`) in which the `rejected` function is called, potentially altering its behavior if it relies on the context of the original promise.

DONE.
