  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `e.stack.length` would return the length of the entire stack trace, whereas `e.stack.indexOf("\n") + 1` returns the length of the first line of the stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.split("\n").length
```
This would result in different behavior because `e.stack.split("\n").length` would return the number of lines in the stack trace, whereas `e.stack.indexOf("\n") + 1` returns the length of the first line of the stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.split("\n")[0].length
```
This would result in different behavior because `e.stack.split("\n")[0].length` would return the length of the first line of the stack trace, whereas `e.stack.indexOf("\n") + 1` returns the length
