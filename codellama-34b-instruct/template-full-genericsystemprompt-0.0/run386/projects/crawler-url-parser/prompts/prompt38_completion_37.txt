  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr, false, false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would not be called with the `resolve` and `parseQueryString` options set to `true`, which could cause the function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr, true, false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would be called with the `resolve` option set to `true`, but the `parseQueryString` option set to `false`, which could cause the function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr, false, true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would be called with the `parseQueryString` option set to `true`, but the `resolve` option set to `false`, which could cause the function to return a different result.

DONE.
