  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `hypot` function to return a different value, potentially leading to incorrect calculations for the `abs` and `arg` methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] - this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `hypot` function to return a different value, potentially leading to incorrect calculations for the `abs` and `arg` methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] - this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `hypot` function to return a different value, potentially leading to incorrect calculations for the `abs` and `arg` methods.

DONE.
