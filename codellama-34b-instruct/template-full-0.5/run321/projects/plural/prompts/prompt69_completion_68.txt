  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memo', 'memo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the `addRule` function is a function that returns the plural form of a word, but in this case, it would return the same word, resulting in an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memo', function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the `addRule` function is a function that returns the plural form of a word, but in this case, it would return the same word with an extra 's' appended to it, resulting in an incorrect plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memo', function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the `addRule` function is a function that returns the plural form of a word, but in this case
