  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, since `object.inspect().state` is always "fulfilled".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state !== "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, since `object.inspect().state` is always "fulfilled".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, since `object.inspect().state` is always "fulfilled".

DONE.
