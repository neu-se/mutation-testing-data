  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain - firstLeft < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter.next()` method to be called with a negative argument, which would result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain - firstLeft === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter.next()` method to be called with an argument of 0, which would result in the `otherIter` object not being advanced.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain - firstLeft > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter.next()` method to be called with an argument greater than 1, which would result in the `otherIter` object being advanced by more than one element.

DONE.
