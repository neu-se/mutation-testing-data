  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `pull.call` is a different method than `pull.apply`, and it has a different way of handling the `this` context and the arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `pull.bind` returns a new function with a bound `this` context and the arguments, while `pull.apply` calls the function with the given arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull.apply(null, ref)
```
This would result in different behavior because `pull.apply(null, ref)` would call the `pull` function with the `this` context set to `null` and the arguments set to the elements of the `ref` array, while `pull.apply(null, ref)` would call the `pull` function with the `this` context set to `null` and the arguments set to the elements of the `ref`
