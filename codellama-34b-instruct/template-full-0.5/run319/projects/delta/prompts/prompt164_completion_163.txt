  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when the next operation in the iterator is an insertion, rather than a deletion.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when the next operation in the iterator is a retain operation, rather than a deletion.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'delete' && thisIter.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when the next operation in the iterator is a delete operation with a non-zero length, rather than a deletion with a zero length.

DONE.
