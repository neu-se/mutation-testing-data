  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the `data` variable, while `data + 1` is a mathematical operation that adds 1 to the value of `data`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the `data` variable, while `data * 2` is a mathematical operation that multiplies the value of `data` by 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the `data` variable, while `data.length` is a reference to the `length` property of the `data` object.

DONE.
