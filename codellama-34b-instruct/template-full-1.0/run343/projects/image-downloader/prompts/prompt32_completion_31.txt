  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(res.statusCode === 200)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the inequality operator (!=) to check if the status code was not equal to 200. Changing the operator to !(res.statusCode === 200) would invert the logic and check if the status code is not equal to 200, but the code would still reject the promise with an error message containing the status code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode % 2 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked if the status code was not equal to 200, but this change would check if the status code is even. If the status code is even, the code would reject the promise with an error message containing the status code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode < 200 || res.statusCode >= 300
