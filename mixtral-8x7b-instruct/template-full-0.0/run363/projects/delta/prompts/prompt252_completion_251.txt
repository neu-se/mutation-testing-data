 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.peek()` returns the next operation without advancing the iterator, while `thisIter.next()` returns and advances the iterator. This could cause an infinite loop in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.previous()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.previous()` returns the previous operation, which might not exist, causing the code to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.hasNext() ? thisIter.next() : null
```
This would result in different behavior because if `thisIter.hasNext()` returns false, it will return `null` instead of throwing an error. This could cause unexpected behavior in the rest of the code, as it might not be prepared to handle `null` values.

DONE.
