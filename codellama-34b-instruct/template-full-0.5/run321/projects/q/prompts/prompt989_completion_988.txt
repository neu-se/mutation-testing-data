  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.reverse()` would return a reversed version of the array, whereas `array_slice` would return a shallow copy of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.concat([1])
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.concat([1])` would return a new array that is the result of concatenating the original array with the additional element `1`, whereas `array_slice` would return a shallow copy of the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.filter(function(x) { return x !== 1; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.filter(function(x) { return x !== 1; })` would return a new array that contains only the elements of the original array that are not equal to `1`, whereas `array_slice
