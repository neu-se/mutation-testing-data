  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.parse` returns an object with the parsed components of the URL, while `URL.format` returns a formatted URL string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.resolve` resolves a relative URL to an absolute URL, while `URL.format` simply formats a URL string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.toString
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.toString` returns a string representation of the URL object, while `URL.format` returns a formatted URL string.

DONE.
