  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]o$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the negated character class `[^aeiou]` would match any character that is not `a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, or `u`, whereas the original code fragment only matches `o`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiou]y$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the character class `[aeiou]` matches any of the vowels, whereas the original code fragment matches any vowel followed by `y`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiou]?$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `?` makes the `e` quantifier optional, whereas the original code fragment requires `e` to be present.

DONE.
