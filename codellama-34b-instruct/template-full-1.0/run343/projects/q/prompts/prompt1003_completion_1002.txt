  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.concat([name])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `array_slice(arguments, 2)` only extracts the arguments from the array, starting from index 2, and the new code fragment `nodeArgs.concat([name])` would also add the `name` property to the `nodeArgs` array, which may not be desirable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `array_slice(arguments, 2)` assumes that the first argument is the `name` property, whereas the new code fragment `nodeArgs.reverse()` would make the last argument the `name` property, which may not be desirable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.ninvoke(nodeArgs.concat([name]))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `array_slice(arguments, 2)` only extract
