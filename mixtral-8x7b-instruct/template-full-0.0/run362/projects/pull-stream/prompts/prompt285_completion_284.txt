 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments `end` and `data` are passed to the callback `cb` immediately, instead of waiting for the inner `read` function to call it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb.apply(null, [end, data])
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` is used instead of invoking the function directly, potentially causing issues with the `this` context within the callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback `cb` is not called at all, and the values of `end` and `data` are logged to the console instead.

DONE.
