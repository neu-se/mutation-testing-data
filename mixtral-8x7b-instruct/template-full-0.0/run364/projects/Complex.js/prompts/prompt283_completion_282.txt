 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the reciprocal of the cosine is used instead of the cosine itself. This change may cause issues when the cosine of the input is zero, leading to division by zero errors or unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the sine function is used instead of the cosine. This change may cause the function to produce incorrect results, as the sine and cosine of a complex number have different properties and outputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.acos
```
This would result in different behavior because the arc cosine function is used instead of the cosine. This change may cause the function to produce incorrect results, as the arc cosine and cosine of a complex number have different properties and outputs.

DONE.
