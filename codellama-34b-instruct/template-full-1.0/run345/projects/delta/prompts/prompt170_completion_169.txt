  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return thisIter.next(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called with a different argument, which may cause the iterator to return a different value or to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return otherIter.next(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called on a different iterator, which may cause the returned value to be different or to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Math.max(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength());
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method is called on both iterators, which may cause the returned value to be different or to throw an error.

DONE.
