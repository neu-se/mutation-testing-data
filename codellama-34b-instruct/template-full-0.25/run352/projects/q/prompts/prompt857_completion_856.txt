  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clearInterval
```
This would result in different behavior because `clearInterval` is a different function from `clearTimeout`, and it would not clear the timeout as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` is a function that sets a timeout, rather than clearing one. It would cause the timeout to be set again, which would not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clearTimeout(timeoutId + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would clear a different timeout than the one that was intended to be cleared. It would clear the timeout with ID `timeoutId + 1`, rather than the timeout with ID `timeoutId`.

DONE.
