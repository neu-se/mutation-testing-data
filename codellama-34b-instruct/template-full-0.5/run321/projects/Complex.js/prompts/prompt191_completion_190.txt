  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` is not the same as `Math.pow`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` is not the same as `Math.pow`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan` is not the same as `Math.pow`.

DONE.
