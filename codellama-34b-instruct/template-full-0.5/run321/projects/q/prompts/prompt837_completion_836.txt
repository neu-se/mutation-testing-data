  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError(error, promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise` parameter is not being used in the original code, and its presence would cause the code to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError(error, Q.resolve(promise))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.resolve(promise)` would cause the `onUnhandledError` function to be called with a resolved promise, which would not be the case in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError(error, Q.reject(promise))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.reject(promise)` would cause the `onUnhandledError` function to be called with a rejected promise, which would not be the case in the original code.

DONE.
