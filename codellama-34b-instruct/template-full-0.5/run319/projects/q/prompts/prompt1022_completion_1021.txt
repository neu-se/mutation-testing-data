  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"send", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method is not defined in the `Promise.prototype`, while `send` is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"dispatch", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because `dispatch` is not a method of `Promise.prototype`, while `post` is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` is not a method of `Promise.prototype`, while `post` is.

DONE.
