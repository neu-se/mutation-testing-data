  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => seg - acc
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the segments to be concatenated in reverse order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => acc - seg
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the segments to be concatenated in reverse order, with negative numbers indicating the presence of a segment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => seg * acc
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the segments to be concatenated in reverse order, with the product of the segment and the accumulator.

DONE.
