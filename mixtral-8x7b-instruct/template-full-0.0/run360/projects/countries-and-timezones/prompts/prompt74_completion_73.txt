 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'<name>'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the string `'<name>'` instead of the actual `name` variable, which may cause issues when comparing or using the timezone name in other parts of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
123
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `name` variable with a hardcoded integer value, causing unexpected results when comparing or using the timezone name in other parts of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `name` variable with a random number, causing unexpected results when comparing or using the timezone name in other parts of the code.

DONE.
