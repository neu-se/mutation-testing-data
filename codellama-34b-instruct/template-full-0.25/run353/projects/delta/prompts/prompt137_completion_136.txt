  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther != null &&
      typeof firstOther.retain === 'number' &&
      firstOther.attributes != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `firstOther.attributes` is `null`, while this code checks if it is not `null`. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if `firstOther.attributes` is not `null`, even if `firstOther.retain` is not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther != null &&
      typeof firstOther.retain === 'number' &&
      firstOther.attributes == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `firstOther.attributes` is `null`, while this code checks if it is `null`. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` if `firstOther.attributes` is not `null`, even if `firstOther.retain` is a number.

Option 3: The PLACE
