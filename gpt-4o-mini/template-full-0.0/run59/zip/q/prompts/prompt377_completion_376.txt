Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newValue + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the value being notified by incrementing it, which could lead to incorrect progress notifications if the original value is expected to remain unchanged.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it sends an `undefined` value for notification, which may cause downstream consumers of the promise to behave incorrectly, as they might expect a valid value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newValue * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it alters the value being notified by doubling it, which could lead to unexpected results for any listeners that rely on the original value for their logic.

DONE.
