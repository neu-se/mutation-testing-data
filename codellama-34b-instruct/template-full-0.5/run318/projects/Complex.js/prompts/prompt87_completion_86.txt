  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` returns `true` if the operand is NaN, while `!isNaN` returns `false` if the operand is NaN. This would cause the code to behave differently in cases where the operand is NaN.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` returns `true` if the operand is a finite number, while `isNaN` returns `true` if the operand is NaN. This would cause the code to behave differently in cases where the operand is a finite number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isNaN` returns `true` if the operand is NaN, while `isNaN` returns `true` if the operand is NaN or if the operand is a string that cannot be converted to a number. This
