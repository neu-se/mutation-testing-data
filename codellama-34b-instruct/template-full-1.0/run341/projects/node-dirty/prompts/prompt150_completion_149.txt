  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the function `cb` with no arguments, while this replacement passes the length of the `c` array as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the function `cb` with no arguments, while this replacement passes the first element of the `c` array as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the function `cb` with no arguments, while this replacement passes the last element of the `c` array as an argument.

DONE.
