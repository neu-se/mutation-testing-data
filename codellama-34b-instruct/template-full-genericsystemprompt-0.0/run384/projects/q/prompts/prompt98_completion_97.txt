  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would decrement the index instead of incrementing it, causing the loop to run indefinitely or not at all.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip every other element in the array, potentially causing the loop to miss important elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would restart from the beginning of the array, potentially causing the loop to run indefinitely or not at all.

DONE.
