  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(null, null, progressed)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the progress notification to be called with the wrong arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(progressed)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the progress notification to be called with the wrong arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(progressed, null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the progress notification to be called with the wrong arguments.

DONE.
