  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"."
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the path relative to the current working directory instead of the absolute path to the module's directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"../"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the path relative to the parent directory instead of the absolute path to the module's directory.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"/"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the path relative to the root directory instead of the absolute path to the module's directory.

DONE.
