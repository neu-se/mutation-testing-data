  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule = this.rules[0];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first rule in the policy, rather than all of them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule = this.rules[Math.floor(Math.random() * this.rules.length)];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would randomly select a rule from the policy, rather than considering all of them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule = this.rules.find((r) => r.name === 'admin');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the rule with the name 'admin', rather than all of them.

DONE.
