  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throw` statement would only throw the `error` object, and not the `promise` object as well.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throw` statement would only throw the `promise` object, and not the `error` object as well.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throw` statement would throw both the `error` and `promise` objects, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
