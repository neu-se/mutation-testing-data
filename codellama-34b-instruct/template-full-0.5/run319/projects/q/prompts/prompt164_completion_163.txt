  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from 1 instead of 0, which could cause the loop to skip the first element of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from -1 instead of 0, which could cause the loop to iterate one extra time.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = this.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from the last element of the array instead of the first, which could cause the loop to iterate in reverse order.

DONE.
