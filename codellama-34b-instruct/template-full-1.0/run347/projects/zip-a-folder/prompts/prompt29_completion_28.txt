  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.on('close', reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function would not be called when the output stream is closed, causing the returned promise to never resolve.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.on('close', () => {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function would not be called when the output stream is closed, causing the returned promise to never resolve.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.on('close', () => resolve('success'));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function would be called with the string `'success'` when the output stream is closed, causing the returned promise to resolve with the value `'success'`.

DONE.
