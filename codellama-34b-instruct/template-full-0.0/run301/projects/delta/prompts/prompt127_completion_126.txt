  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(end - index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would be called with a different argument, potentially causing the iterator to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(end - index - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would be called with a different argument, potentially causing the iterator to return a different value.

DONE.
