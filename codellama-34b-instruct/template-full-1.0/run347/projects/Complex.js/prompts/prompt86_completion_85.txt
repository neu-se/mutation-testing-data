  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] !== ' ' && !isNaN(tokens[i + 1]) && tokens[i + 1] !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also check if the next token is not equal to null, which would cause the check for Infinity to be ignored.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] !== ' ' && !isNaN(tokens[i + 1]) && tokens[i + 1].length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also check if the next token has length 1, which would cause Infinity to be ignored.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] !== ' ' && !isNaN(tokens[i + 1]) && tokens[i + 1].trim() !== ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also check if
