  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'file://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original line uses the protocol `http://`, while the new line uses the protocol `file://`. This could cause the code to behave differently if the URL being parsed contains a scheme such as `file://`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original line uses the protocol `http://`, while the new line uses the protocol `https://`. This could cause the code to behave differently if the URL being parsed contains a scheme such as `https://`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'ftp://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original line uses the protocol `http://`, while the new line uses the protocol `ftp://`. This could cause the code to behave differently if the URL being parsed contains a scheme such as `ftp://`.

DONE.
