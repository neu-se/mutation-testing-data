  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `task` is a function that is expected to be called, but replacing it with `null` would cause the function to not be called at all.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `task` is a function that is expected to be called, but replacing it with `undefined` would cause the function to not be called at all.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `task` is a function that is expected to be called, but replacing it with `throw new Error()` would cause an error to be thrown instead of the function being called.

DONE.
