  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newline, start + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the start position would be incremented by 1, which would cause the code to skip over the first character of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newline, start - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the start position would be decremented by 1, which would cause the code to start at a different position in the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newline, start + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the start position would be incremented by 2, which would cause the code to skip over the first two characters of the string.

DONE.
