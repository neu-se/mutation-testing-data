 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$('base').attr('data-href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to access the 'data-href' attribute instead of the 'href' attribute of the 'base' element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$('head base').attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to access the 'href' attribute of the 'base' element within the 'head' tag, which might not always exist or might not be the first 'base' element in the HTML.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$('base')[0].getAttribute('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the JavaScript 'getAttribute' method to access the 'href' attribute of the 'base' element, which might not always work as expected with jQuery's 'attr' method.

DONE.
