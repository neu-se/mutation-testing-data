  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback(basis, this[index], index)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method is not being used, which means that the `this` context of the callback function will not be set correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call(this, basis, this[index], index)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method is being used with the wrong `this` context. The `this` context of the callback function should be set to the array being reduced, but in this case it is being set to the global object.
