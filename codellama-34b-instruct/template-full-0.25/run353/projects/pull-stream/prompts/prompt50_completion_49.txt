  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s instanceof Function
```
This would result in different behavior because `instanceof` checks if an object is an instance of a class, while `typeof` checks the type of a variable. In this case, `s` may not be a function, but it could still be an instance of a class that has a `sink` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.constructor === Function
```
This would result in different behavior because `constructor` is a property of an object that refers to the function that created the object, while `typeof` checks the type of a variable. In this case, `s` may not be a function, but it could still have a `constructor` property that refers to a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof s === 'object' && s.sink
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` checks the type of a variable, while `s.sink` checks if the `sink` method
