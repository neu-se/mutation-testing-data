  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `b` to calculate the complex square root, while replacing it with `a` would use the real part instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `b` to calculate the complex square root, while replacing it with `a + b` would use the sum of the real and imaginary parts instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `b` to calculate the complex square root, while replacing it with `a - b` would use the difference of the real and imaginary parts instead.

DONE.
