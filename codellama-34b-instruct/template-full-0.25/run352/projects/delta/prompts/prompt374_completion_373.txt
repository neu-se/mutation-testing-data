  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.next(1)` would return the next operation in the iterator, but it would also advance the iterator by one position, which would cause the loop to skip the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.next(2)` would return the next two operations in the iterator, but it would also advance the iterator by two positions, which would cause the loop to skip the next two operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.next(0)` would return the next operation in the iterator, but it would not advance the iterator, which would cause the loop to repeatedly return the same operation.

DONE.
