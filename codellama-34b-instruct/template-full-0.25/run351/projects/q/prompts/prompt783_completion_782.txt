  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(function() { return; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with `undefined` instead of the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(function() { throw new Error(); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with an error instead of being fulfilled with the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(function() { return Q.reject(); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a rejection reason of `undefined` instead of being fulfilled with the original value.

DONE.
