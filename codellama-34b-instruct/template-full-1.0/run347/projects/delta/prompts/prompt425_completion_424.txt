  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof module ===!/ ' object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator returns a string representation of the type of the operand, so this code would evaluate to `typeof module === 'object'` which is the same as the original.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
module.exports == 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because `module.exports` is an object, so this code would evaluate to `module.exports == 'object'` which is not the same as the original.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
module.exports instanceof Object
```
This would result in different behavior because `module.exports` is an object, so this code would evaluate to `module.exports instanceof Object` which is not the same as the original.

DONE.
