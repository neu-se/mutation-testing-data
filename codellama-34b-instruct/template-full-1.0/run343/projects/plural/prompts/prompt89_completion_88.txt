  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'human', 'humans'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original rule for 'person' to 'people' would no longer apply, and the new rule for 'human' to 'humans' would be used instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'child', 'childs'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original rule for 'person' to 'people' would still apply, but the new rule for 'child' to 'childs' would also be used, which would cause a word ending in 's' to be pluralized to 'childs'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mouse', 'mices'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original rule for 'person' to 'people' and the new rule for 'mouse' to 'mice' would still apply, but the new rule for 'person' to 'peoples' would no longer be used.

DONE.
