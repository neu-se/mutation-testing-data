  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flush()` function is not defined in the provided code fragment, so it would throw a `ReferenceError` instead of running the `flush` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` schedules the `flush` function to be called after a delay of 1 millisecond, whereas the original code fragment called `flush` immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(() => { flush(); }, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setTimeout` function takes a function expression as its first argument, and the `flush` function is not defined as a function expression in the original code fragment. Instead, it is defined as a simple function declaration.

DONE.
