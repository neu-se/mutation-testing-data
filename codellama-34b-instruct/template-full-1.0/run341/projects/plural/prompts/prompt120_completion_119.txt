  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 's'; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would not add an "s" to the end of the word, but this new fragment would.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.length; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return the plural form of the word, but this new fragment would return the length of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 's' + 's'; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would add an "s" to the end of the word, but this new fragment would add two "s"s to the end of the word.

DONE.
