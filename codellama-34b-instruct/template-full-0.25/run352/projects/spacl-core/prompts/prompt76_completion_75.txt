  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for...of` loop would not execute, as `null` is not iterable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for...of` loop would not execute, as `undefined` is not iterable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for...of` loop would execute, but the loop variable `rule` would be assigned the value `0` instead of a `Rule` object, which would cause the loop to exit immediately.

DONE.
