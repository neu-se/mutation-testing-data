  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0.3 * Math.sinh(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sinh(b)` is not the same as `cosh(b)`, and the factor `0.3` is not the same as `1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Math.cosh(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cosh(b)` is not the same as `cosh(b)`, and the factor `-1` is not the same as `1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 Math.ratio(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ratio(b)` returns a different value than `cosh(b)`, and the factor `1` is not the same as `1`.

DONE.
