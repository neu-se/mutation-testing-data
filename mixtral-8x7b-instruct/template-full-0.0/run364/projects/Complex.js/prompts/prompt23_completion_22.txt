 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > b
```
This would result in different behavior because it reverses the condition, potentially leading to incorrect branching in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a == b
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for equality instead of inequality, which would cause the wrong branch to be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a >= b
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for "greater than or equal to" instead of "less than", potentially leading to incorrect branching in the code.

DONE.
