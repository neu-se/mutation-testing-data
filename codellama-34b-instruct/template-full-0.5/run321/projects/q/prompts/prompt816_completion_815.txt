  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `done` is a method that terminates a promise chain, whereas `then` is a method that allows for chaining additional handlers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `done` does not handle rejected promises, whereas `catch` is used to handle rejected promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).finally
```
This would result in different behavior because `done` does not allow for cleanup actions to be performed after the promise is settled, whereas `finally` allows for cleanup actions to be performed regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected.

DONE.
