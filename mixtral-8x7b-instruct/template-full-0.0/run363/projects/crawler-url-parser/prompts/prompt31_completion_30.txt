 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/^(?!(?:[a-z0-9]+:)?\/\/)/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it makes the protocol check case-insensitive, which is different from the original regular expression that only matches lowercase protocols.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/^(?!(?:\w+):?\/\/)/
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the unnecessary capturing group around the protocol, but it still matches the original pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/^(?!(?:https?|ftp):?\/\/)/
```
This would result in different behavior because it only allows 'http', 'https', and 'ftp' as valid protocols, while the original regular expression matches any protocol that is not explicitly disallowed.

DONE.
