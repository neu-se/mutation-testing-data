  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(answerPs[i]).then(resolve, reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called with the `resolve` and `reject` functions as arguments, which would cause the promise to be resolved or rejected immediately, rather than waiting for all promises in the array to be settled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(answerPs[i]).then(function (value) {
    resolve(value);
}, function (reason) {
    reject(reason);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called with an anonymous function that takes two arguments, `value` and `reason`, and calls `resolve` and `reject` with those values, respectively. This would cause the promise to be resolved or rejected with the values returned by the `then` method, rather than the original values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(answerPs[i]).then
