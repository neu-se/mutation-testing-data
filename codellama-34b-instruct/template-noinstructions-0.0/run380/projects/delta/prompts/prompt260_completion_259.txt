  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.delete, otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` function to compare the `delete` properties of the two operations, rather than the `insert` properties as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain, otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` function to compare the `retain` properties of the two operations, rather than the `insert` properties as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert, otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` function to compare the `insert` property of `thisOp` with the `retain` property of `otherOp`, rather than the `insert` properties as intended.

DONE.
