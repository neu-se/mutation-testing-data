  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return
```
This would result in different behavior because the method would return `undefined` instead of `this`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return null
```
This would result in different behavior because the method would return `null` instead of `this`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the method would return an empty object instead of `this`.

DONE.
