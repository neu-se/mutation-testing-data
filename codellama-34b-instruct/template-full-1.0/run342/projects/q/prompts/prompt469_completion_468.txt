  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons[at + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would instead reference the next element in the `unhandledReasons` array, which may not exist or be the correct value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons[at - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would instead reference the previous element in the `unhandledReasons` array, which may not exist or be the correct value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove and return the first element of the `unhandledReasons` array, which may not be the correct value.

DONE.
