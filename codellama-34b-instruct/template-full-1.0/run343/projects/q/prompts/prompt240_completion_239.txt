  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nearerValue === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the value is a function, not a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue.isFulfilled()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only allow fulfilled promises to be shortened, not rejected or pending promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue.promiseDispatch.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only allow dispatches with a single argument to be shortened, not dispatches with multiple arguments.

DONE.
