Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[^aeiou]y$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly changes words ending in a consonant followed by 'y' to simply add 's' instead of changing 'y' to 'ies', which would lead to incorrect pluralization for words like "cherry".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/x$|ch$|s$/g, function(w) { return w + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because changing the regex flag from 'i' (case insensitive) to 'g' (global) would cause the rule to not match correctly for pluralization, potentially leading to incorrect results for words like "Box" or "CHurch".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/(fe?$)/i, function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly add 's' to words ending in 'f' or 'fe', such as "
