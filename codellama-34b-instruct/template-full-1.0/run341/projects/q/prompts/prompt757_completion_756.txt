  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"allRejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the method name is incorrect, and the test suite would not detect the bug.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"allFulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the method name is incorrect, and the test suite would not detect the bug.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"anyRejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the method name is incorrect, and the test suite would not detect the bug.

DONE.
