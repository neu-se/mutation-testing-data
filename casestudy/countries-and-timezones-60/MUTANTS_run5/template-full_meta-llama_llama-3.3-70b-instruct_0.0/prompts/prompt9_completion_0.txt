Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil` rounds up to the nearest integer, whereas the original `Math.floor` rounds down, potentially changing the calculated hours in the offset string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
offset => Math.round(offset / 60)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `Math.round` which rounds to the nearest integer, and also defines a function that takes `offset` as an argument, which could lead to incorrect results if not properly handled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number, but does not perform any rounding, so the result would be a floating-point number instead of an integer, potentially causing issues when used in string formatting.

DONE.
