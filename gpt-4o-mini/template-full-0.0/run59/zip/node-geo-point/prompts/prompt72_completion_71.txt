Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String
```
This would result in different behavior because the distance is expected to be a number for calculations, and using a string would lead to type errors or incorrect calculations when performing arithmetic operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the distance is incorrectly doubled, which would lead to an inaccurate destination point being calculated, effectively moving the point twice as far as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the distance is halved, which would lead to the destination point being calculated at half the intended distance, resulting in an incorrect location.

DONE.
