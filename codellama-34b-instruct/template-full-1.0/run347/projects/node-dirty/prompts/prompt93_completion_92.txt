  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code raises an error with a fixed message, while the new code raises an error with the key as the message, which could be different for different inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(val)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code raises an error with a fixed message, while the new code raises an error with the value as the message, which could be different for different inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(key + ' ' + val)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code raises an error with a fixed message, while the new code raises an error with a message that concatenates the key and value, which could be different for different inputs.

DONE.
