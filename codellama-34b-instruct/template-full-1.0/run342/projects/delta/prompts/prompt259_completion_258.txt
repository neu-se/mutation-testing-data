  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because the inserted text would be deleted instead of retained.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the retained text would be inserted instead of retained.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the inserted text would be inserted again instead of retained.

DONE.
