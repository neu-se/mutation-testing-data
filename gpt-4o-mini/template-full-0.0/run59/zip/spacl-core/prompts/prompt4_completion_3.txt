Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.*$/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly checks if the entire string matches any character (including an empty string), which will always return a match for non-empty strings, thus never throwing an error for paths that do not start with a slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^\/.*$/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the string starts with a slash followed by any characters, which would incorrectly allow paths that start with a slash but are otherwise invalid, failing to catch paths that do not start with a slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^[^/].*$/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the string does not start with a slash, which would incorrectly allow paths that start with any character other than a slash, thus failing to enforce the requirement that paths must begin with a slash.

DONE.
