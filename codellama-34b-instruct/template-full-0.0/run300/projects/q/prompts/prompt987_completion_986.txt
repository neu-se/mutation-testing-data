  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra `null` argument would be passed to the `post` method, which could cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra `undefined` argument would be passed to the `post` method, which could cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, "foo"]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra string argument would be passed to the `post` method, which could cause an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
