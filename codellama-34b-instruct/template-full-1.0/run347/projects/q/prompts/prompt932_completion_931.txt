  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a valid JavaScript expression that evaluates to `undefined`, while `null` is a distinct value that could potentially cause the surrounding code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a valid JavaScript expression that evaluates to `undefined`, while `undefined` is a distinct value that could potentially cause the surrounding code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void null
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a valid JavaScript expression that evaluates to `undefined`, while `void null` is not a valid JavaScript expression and would result in a syntax error.

DONE.
