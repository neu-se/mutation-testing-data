  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to the `array_slice` function is now `2`, which would skip the first argument to the `Q.fcall` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to the `array_slice` function is now `0`, which would include the first argument to the `Q.fcall` function in the resulting array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to the `array_slice` function is now `2`, which would include the second argument to the `Q.fcall` function in the resulting array.

DONE.
