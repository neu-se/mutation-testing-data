  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolvedPromise` is a boolean value, whereas `true` is a constant value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolvedPromise` is a boolean value, whereas `undefined` is a value that represents the absence of a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolvedPromise` is a boolean value, whereas `null` is a special value that represents an empty or non-existent value.

DONE.
