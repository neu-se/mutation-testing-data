  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id, { deprecated: true });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deprecated` option would be set to `true`, which would cause the `deliverCountry` function to return a different value than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id, { allTimezones: true });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allTimezones` option would be set to `true`, which would cause the `deliverCountry` function to return a different value than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id, { timezones: [] });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `timezones` option would be set to an empty array, which would cause the `deliverCountry` function to return a different value than the original code fragment.

DONE.
