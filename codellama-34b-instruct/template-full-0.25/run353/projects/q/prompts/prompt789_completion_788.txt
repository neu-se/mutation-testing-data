  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with `undefined` instead of the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(null, function () { throw new Error("error"); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a new error instead of the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(function () { return Q.reject("error"); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a new error instead of the original value.

DONE.
