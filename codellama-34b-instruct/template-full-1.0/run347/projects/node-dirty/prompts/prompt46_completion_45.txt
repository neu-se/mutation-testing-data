  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, updater(this.get(key)));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of `key` to the result of `updater(this.get(key))` instead of using the provided `updater` function to update the existing value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, updater(this.get(key)) + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the result of `updater(this.get(key))` before setting the value of `key`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, updater(this.get(key)) - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 to the result of `updater(this.get(key))` before setting the value of `key`.

DONE.
