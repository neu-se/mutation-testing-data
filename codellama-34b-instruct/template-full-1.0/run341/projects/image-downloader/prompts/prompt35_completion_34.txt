  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.on('data', () => {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `res.pipe`, which streams the data to the destination while `res.on('data', () => {})` simply registers an event listener for the 'data' event and does not stream the data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.once('data', () => {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `res.pipe`, which streams the data to the destination while `res.once('data', () => {})` registers an event listener for the 'data' event and removes it after the first invocation, which would not stream the data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.removeListener('data', () => {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `res.pipe`, which streams the data to the destination while `res.removeListener('data',
