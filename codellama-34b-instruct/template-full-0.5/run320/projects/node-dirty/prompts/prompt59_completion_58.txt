  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.close(this._writeStream);
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.close()` is called with a write stream as an argument, which would cause the write stream to be closed before it has a chance to flush all its data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.close(this._readStream);
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.close()` is called with a read stream as an argument, which would cause the read stream to be closed before it has a chance to read all the data from the file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.close(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.close()` is called with a null argument, which would cause the stream to be closed without any data being written to the file.

DONE.
