  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"stacktrace"
```
This would result in different behavior because "stacktrace" is not a valid property of the Error object, while "stack" is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"stack".toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the stack trace would be in lowercase, while the original code expects the stack trace to be in its original case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"stack".split("").reverse().join("")
```
This would result in different behavior because the stack trace would be reversed, while the original code expects the stack trace to be in its original order.

DONE.
