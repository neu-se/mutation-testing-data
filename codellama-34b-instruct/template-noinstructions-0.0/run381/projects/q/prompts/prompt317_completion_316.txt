  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` method would not be able to call the `when` method on the `promise` object, as `null` does not have a `when` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` method would not be able to call the `when` method on the `promise` object, as `undefined` does not have a `when` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` method would not be able to call the `when` method on the `promise` object, as `{}` does not have a `when` method.

DONE.
