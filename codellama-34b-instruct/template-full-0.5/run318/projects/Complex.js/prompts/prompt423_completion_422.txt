  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the result of `isInfinite`, which would cause the `inverse` method to return a different value than it would with the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the complex number is finite, which would cause the `inverse` method to return a different value than it would with the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the complex number is NaN, which would cause the `inverse` method to return a different value than it would with the original code.

DONE.
