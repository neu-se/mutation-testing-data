  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `retain` command to delete a number of characters equal to the length of the next operation in the `other` sequence, rather than the length of the current operation in the `this` sequence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `retain` command to delete a number of characters equal to the length of the next operation in the `other` sequence, rather than the length of the current operation in the `this` sequence.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `retain` command to delete a number of characters equal to the length of the next operation in the `other` sequence, plus 1 character.

DONE.
