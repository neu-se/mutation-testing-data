 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new error object, while the original code fragment uses the `e` variable which presumably contains an error object already. This change would affect the error handling in the `_rejected` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the error object with `null`. This change would cause the `rejected` callback in the `Q.when` function to not receive an error object, but a `null` value instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'An error occurred'
