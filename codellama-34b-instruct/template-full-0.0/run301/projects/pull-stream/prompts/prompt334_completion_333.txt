  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && data
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end` is a boolean value, while `end && data` is a boolean value that is only true if both `end` and `data` are true. This change would cause the function to return a different value in some cases, which could potentially cause issues in the code that uses this function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || data
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end` is a boolean value, while `end || data` is a boolean value that is only true if either `end` or `data` is true. This change would cause the function to return a different value in some cases, which could potentially cause issues in the code that uses this function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end` is a boolean value, while `!end` is a boolean value
