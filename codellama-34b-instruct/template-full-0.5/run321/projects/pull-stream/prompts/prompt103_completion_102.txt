  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add 1 to the `data` value, which would change the output of the `console.log` statement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the first element of the `data` array, which may not exist or may have a different value than the original `data` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would print the length of the `data` array, which may be different from the original `data` value.

DONE.
