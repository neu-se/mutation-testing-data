Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the `next` method to always consume one unit from the `otherIter`, potentially skipping over important operations that should be included in the composition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next();
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses the `thisIter` iterator instead of the `otherIter`, leading to the wrong operations being processed and potentially altering the intended composition of the deltas.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek();
```
This would result in different behavior because it retrieves the next operation without consuming it, which means the same operation could be processed multiple times in subsequent iterations, leading to incorrect results in the composed delta.

DONE.
