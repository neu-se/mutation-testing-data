  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 1, array_slice(arguments)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the spread of the `arguments` object into a different value, causing the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the spread of the `arguments` object into a different value, causing the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 0, -1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the spread of the `arguments` object into a different value, causing the function to behave differently.

DONE.
