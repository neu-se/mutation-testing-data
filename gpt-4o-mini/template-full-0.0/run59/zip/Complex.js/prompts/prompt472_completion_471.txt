Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === 0 && this['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if both the real and imaginary parts are zero, which would incorrectly indicate that the complex number is NaN when it is actually zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] < 0 || this['im'] < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if either the real or imaginary part is negative, which does not accurately determine if the complex number is NaN, leading to false positives.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isFinite(this['re']) && !isFinite(this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if both the real and imaginary parts are not finite, which would incorrectly classify a complex number with finite values as NaN.

DONE.
