  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`/[^/]+${part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$1')}`
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any character that is not a forward slash, instead of just the input string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`[^/]+${part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$1')}`
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not have a leading forward slash, which would change the matching behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`/[^/]+${part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$1')}`
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any character that is not a forward slash, instead of just the input string.

DONE.
