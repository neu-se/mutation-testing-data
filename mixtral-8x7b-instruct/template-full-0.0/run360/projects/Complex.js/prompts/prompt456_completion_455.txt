 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
isNaN(this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'isNaN' check now only considers the imaginary part, not both real and imaginary parts.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re'] > 1000
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the real part is greater than 1000, instead of checking if the complex number is NaN.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re'].toString().includes('Infinity')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the string representation of the real part includes 'Infinity', instead of checking if the complex number is NaN.

DONE.
