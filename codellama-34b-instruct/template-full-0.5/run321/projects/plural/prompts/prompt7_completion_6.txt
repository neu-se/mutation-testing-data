  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rules.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` adds an element to the end of the array, while `unshift` adds an element to the beginning. In this case, the `addRule` function is designed to add new rules to the beginning of the `rules` array, so using `push` would cause the new rule to be added to the end of the array instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rules.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` removes the first element from the array, while `unshift` adds an element to the beginning. In this case, the `addRule` function is designed to add new rules to the beginning of the `rules` array, so using `shift` would cause the first rule to be removed instead of a new rule being added.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rules.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes the last element from the array
