  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<` operator would be replaced with `<=` which means that the loop would iterate one more time that it would depending on the behavior of the code without the change.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `>` operator would be replaced with `>`, which means that the loop would never iterate if the value of `index` is less than the value of `length`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index == length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the equality operator would be used instead of `index < length`, `index == length` would also result in different behavior if there was no element with the index equal to the length of the array..

DONE.
