  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.search` returns the index of the first occurrence of the given regular expression in the string, while `path.match` returns an array of all matches.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.replace
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.replace` replaces the first occurrence of the given regular expression in the string with the given replacement string, while `path.match` returns an array of all matches.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.split` splits the string into an array of substrings, using the given regular expression as the separator, while `path.match` returns an array of all matches.

DONE.
