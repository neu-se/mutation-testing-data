  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!unique
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `unique` function, causing the `nonUnique` function to pass through items that were previously filtered out.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unique(field, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unique` function is called with a different second argument, which could cause the function to behave differently depending on the implementation of the `unique` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field.includes(field)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `includes` method checks if the `field` is a substring of itself, which is always true, causing the `nonUnique` function to pass through all items.

DONE.
