  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `error` object, which would have been passed to the `deferred.reject` method, causing the promise to be rejected with the `error` object. Replacing it with `null` would cause the promise to be resolved with `null`, which would not have the same behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `error` object, which would have
