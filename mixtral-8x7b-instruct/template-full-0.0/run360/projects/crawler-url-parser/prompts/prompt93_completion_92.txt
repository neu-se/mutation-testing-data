require('../url_parser_mutation_test/bad_parse')

This would result in different behavior because `bad_parse` is a hypothetical module that does not properly parse URLs, unlike the original `URL.parse` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'bad_parse'
```
This would result in different behavior because `'bad_parse'` is a string that would be passed as the first argument to `URL.format`, which would likely result in a runtime error since `URL.format` expects an object as its first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => { /* some code that doesn't parse URLs */ }
```
This would result in different behavior because an arrow function that doesn't parse URLs would be passed as the first argument to `URL.format`, which would likely result in a runtime error since `URL.format` expects an object as
