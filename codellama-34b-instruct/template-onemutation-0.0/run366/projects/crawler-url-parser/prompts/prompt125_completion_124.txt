  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof linkurl == "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `linkurl` is a string, but the new code fragment checks if it is an object. This could cause the function to behave differently when it encounters a different type of input.

DONE.
