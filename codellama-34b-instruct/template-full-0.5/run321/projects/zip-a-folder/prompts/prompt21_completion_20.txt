  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `targetFilePath` is a variable that holds the path of the target file, while the new code fragment `"foo"` is a string literal that does not represent a valid file path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `targetFilePath` is a variable that holds the path of the target file, while the new code fragment `null` is a null value that does not represent a valid file path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `targetFilePath` is a variable that holds the path of the target file, while the new code fragment `undefined` is an undefined value that does not represent a valid file path.

DONE.
