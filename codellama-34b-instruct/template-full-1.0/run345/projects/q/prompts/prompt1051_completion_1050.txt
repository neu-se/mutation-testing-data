  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER in the code with a buggy code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end.tail
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `end` object to be used as a function, which would throw an error because it is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `ends` object to be used as a promise, which would throw an error because it is not a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `closed` object to be used as a promise, which would throw an error because it is not a promise.

DONE.
