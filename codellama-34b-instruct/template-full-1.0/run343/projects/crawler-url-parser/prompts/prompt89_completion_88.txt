  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the text content of the element, while the original code returns the original HTML code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text() + " " + $(this).text()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return twice the text content of the element, while the original code returns the original HTML code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the text content of the element in uppercase, while the original code returns the original HTML code.

DONE.
