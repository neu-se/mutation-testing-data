  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.on('close', () => resolve({ filename: dest }));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not resolve the promise with an object containing the key "filename" and the value of the variable "dest". Instead, it resolves the promise with a newly created object with the key "filename" and the value of the variable "dest".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.on('close', () => resolve({ filename: 'new_dest' }));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not resolve the promise with an object containing the key "filename" and a hardcoded value of "new_dest". Instead, it resolves the promise with a newly created object with the key "filename" and the value of the variable "dest".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.on('close', () => resolve());
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment resolves the
