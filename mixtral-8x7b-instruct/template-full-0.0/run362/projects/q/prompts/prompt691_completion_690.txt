 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"spy", [void 0, array_slice(arguments)]
```
This would result in different behavior because `dispatch` method would look for a `spy` method in the object instead of `apply`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
["apply", array_slice(arguments)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument of `dispatch` method should be an array, but here it is a plain string `"apply"`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"apply", [this, arguments]
