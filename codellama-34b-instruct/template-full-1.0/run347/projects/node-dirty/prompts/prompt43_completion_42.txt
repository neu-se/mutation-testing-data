  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" new key(), val"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always generate a new key, rather than using the existing key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"val, key"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the key and value in the "forEach" callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"key, 0"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always pass the value 0 as the second argument to the "forEach" callback, rather than the actual value stored at the key.

DONE.
