  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify` method would be called with `null` as the argument, which would cause the `progress` event to be emitted with a `null` value, rather than the expected `value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify` method would be called with `undefined` as the argument, which would cause the `progress` event to be emitted with an `undefined` value, rather than the expected `value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"some string"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify` method would be called with the string `"some string"` as the argument, which would cause the `progress` event to be emitted with the string `"some string"` as the value, rather than the expected `value`.

DONE.
