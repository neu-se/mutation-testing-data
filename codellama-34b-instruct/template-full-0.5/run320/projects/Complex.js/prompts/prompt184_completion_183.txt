  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0 && b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the conditions is reversed, which could cause the expression to evaluate to a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0 || b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the logical OR operator is used instead of the logical AND operator, which could cause the expression to evaluate to a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 && b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression checks if both `a` and `b` are equal to zero, which could cause the expression to evaluate to a different value.

DONE.
