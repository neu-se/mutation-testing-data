  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return baseIndex + length;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `reduce` method to return a different value, potentially causing the `invert` method to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return baseIndex + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `reduce` method to return a different value, potentially causing the `invert` method to produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return baseIndex + 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `reduce` method to return a different value, potentially causing the `invert` method to produce incorrect results.

DONE.
