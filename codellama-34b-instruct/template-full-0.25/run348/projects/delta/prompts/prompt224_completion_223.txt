  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cursor + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the cursor by one, potentially causing the diff algorithm to miss certain differences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cursor - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the cursor by one, potentially causing the diff algorithm to miss certain differences.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cursor * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the cursor value, potentially causing the diff algorithm to miss certain differences.

DONE.
