  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method would cause the array to be reversed, which would affect the order of the elements in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').filter(Boolean)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter()` method would remove any elements that are falsy, which could remove important information from the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method would remove the first element of the array, which could cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
