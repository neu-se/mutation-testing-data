  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback(error, value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only passes the error to the nodeback, while this modified code passes both the error and the value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes the error to the nodeback, while this modified code only passes the value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback(error, error)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes the error and the value to the nodeback, while this modified code passes the error twice.

DONE.
