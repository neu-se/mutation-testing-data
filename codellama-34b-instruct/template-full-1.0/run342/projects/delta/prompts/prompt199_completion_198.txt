  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.rest()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.rest()` is a method that returns the remaining ops in the iterator, whereas `thisIter.rest` is a property that refers to the nextOp after the current op.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.rest()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.rest()` is a method that returns the remaining ops in the iterator, whereas `otherIter.rest` is a property that refers to the nextOp after the current op.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.slice(1)` returns a new iterator that starts from the second op, whereas `thisIter.rest` refers to the nextOp after the current op.

DONE.
