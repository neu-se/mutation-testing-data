  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\/\//) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the path contains double slashes, while this new code fragment checks if the path does not contain double slashes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\/\//) !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the path contains double slashes, while this new code fragment checks if the path does not contain double slashes and also checks if the result of the match is not undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\/\//) !== null && spec.match(/\/\//).length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the path contains double slashes, while this new code fragment checks if the path does not contain double slashes and also checks if the result of the match is not null and has a length greater than 0
