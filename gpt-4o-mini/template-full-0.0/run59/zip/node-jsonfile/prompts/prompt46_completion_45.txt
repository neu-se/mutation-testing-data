Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFile(file, str, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `fs.writeFile` (asynchronous) instead of `fs.writeFileSync` (synchronous), which could lead to unexpected behavior in the calling code that expects a synchronous operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync(file, str, { flag: 'a' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an option to append to the file instead of overwriting it, which could lead to data being appended rather than replaced.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync(file, str, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes `null` as the options argument, which may cause the method to behave incorrectly or throw an error if the method expects an object.

DONE.
