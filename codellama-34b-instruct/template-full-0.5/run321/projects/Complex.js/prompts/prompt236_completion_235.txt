  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r + a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator is used instead of the `-` operator, which would cause the denominator to be different and potentially result in a different value for `im`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (a - r)
```
This would result in different behavior because the operands are reversed, which would cause the denominator to be different and potentially result in a different value for `im`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (a * r)
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operator is used instead of the subtraction operator, which would cause the denominator to be different and potentially result in a different value for `im`.

DONE.
