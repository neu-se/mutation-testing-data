Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"callback"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string "callback" does not represent a promise, which would change the expected behavior of the module that relies on promise functionality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because using "undefined" instead of "promise" would lead to the module not being able to function correctly, as it would not have a valid promise implementation to work with.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"null"
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing "promise" with "null" would cause the module to fail when trying to access properties or methods on a null value, leading to runtime errors.

DONE.
