  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places && 0
```
This would result in a different behavior because it would evaluate to 0 if places is falsy (i.e. 0, null, undefined, NaN, empty string), whereas the original code would evaluate to 0 only if places is strictly equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places ?? 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the nullish coalescing operator to check if places is null or undefined and return 0 in that case, whereas the original code would not check for nullish values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places || NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return NaN (Not a Number) if places is falsy, whereas the original code would return 0.

DONE.
