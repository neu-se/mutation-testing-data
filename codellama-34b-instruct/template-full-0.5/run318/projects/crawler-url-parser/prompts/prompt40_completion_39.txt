  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host != null && baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the condition, causing the code to enter the `if` block when `parsedUrl.host` is not null, rather than when it is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host == baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare `parsedUrl.host` to `baseUrlStr`, rather than comparing it to null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host != baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the condition, causing the code to enter the `if` block when `parsedUrl.host` is not equal to `baseUrlStr`, rather than when it is equal.

DONE.
