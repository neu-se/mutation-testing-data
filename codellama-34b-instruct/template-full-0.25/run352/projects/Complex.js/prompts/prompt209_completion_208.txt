  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `atan2` function to receive the same value for both the `y` and `x` parameters, which would result in a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `atan2` function to receive a different value for the `y` parameter, which would result in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `atan2` function to receive a different value for the `y` parameter, which would result in a different output.

DONE.
