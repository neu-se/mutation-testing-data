  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `val` is `undefined`, while this new code fragment checks if `val` is not `undefined`. This means that if `val` is `undefined`, the original code fragment would delete the key from the map, while this new code fragment would set the key to `undefined` in the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `val` is `undefined`, while this new code fragment checks if `val` is `null`. This means that if `val` is `null`, the original code fragment would delete the key from the map, while this new code fragment would set the key to `null` in the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof val === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `val` is `undefined`, while
