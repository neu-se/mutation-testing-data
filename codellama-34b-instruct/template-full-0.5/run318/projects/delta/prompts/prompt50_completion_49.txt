  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function expects `a` and `b` to be objects, but `1` is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function expects `a` and `b` to have the same keys, but `[]` is an empty array and does not have any keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function expects `a` and `b` to be objects, but `null` is not an object.

DONE.
