 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/[aeiou]o/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches any string containing the pattern `[aeiou]o` instead of matching strings ending with the pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/[aeiouy]o$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag makes it a global search, changing its behavior from matching the last occurrence in a string to matching all occurrences.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/[aeiouy]o$/d
```
This would result in different behavior because the `d` flag makes it a sticky regular expression, which affects how it searches for the pattern in a string.

DONE.
