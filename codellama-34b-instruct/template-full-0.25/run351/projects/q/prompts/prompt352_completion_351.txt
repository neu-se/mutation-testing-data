  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("rejected");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error instead of returning a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a resolved promise instead of a rejected one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(new Error("rejected"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a rejected promise with a different error message.

DONE.
