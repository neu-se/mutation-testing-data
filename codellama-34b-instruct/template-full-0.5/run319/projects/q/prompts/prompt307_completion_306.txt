  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(answerPs[i + 1]).then
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first promise in the array and use the second promise instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(answerPs[i] + 1).then
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the index of the promise in the array, which would result in an error if the index is out of bounds.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(answerPs[i] * 2).then
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the index of the promise in the array by 2, which would result in an error if the index is not an even number.

DONE.
