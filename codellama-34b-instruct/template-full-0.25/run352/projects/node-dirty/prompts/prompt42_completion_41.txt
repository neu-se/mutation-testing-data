  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `forEach` method to skip over any keys that have a value of `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `forEach` method to skip over any keys that have a value of `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `forEach` method to skip over any keys that have a value of `false`.

DONE.
