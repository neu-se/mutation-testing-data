  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country.id
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if `country` is an object, even if it's an empty object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `0` if `country` is an object, even if it's an empty object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country.name
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `undefined` if `country` is an object, even if it's an empty object.

DONE.
