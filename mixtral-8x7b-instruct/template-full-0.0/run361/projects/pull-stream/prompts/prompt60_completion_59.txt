 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(abort || true, done || function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of calling the `read` function with `null` as the first argument, it would pass `abort || true` which could cause the `read` function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink.abort(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `sink.abort` function with a boolean value of `true` as an argument, which would cause the `abort` variable to be set to `true` and potentially change the flow of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
doneLackingErr.message = 'New error message'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the error message that is logged when the `done` callback is not provided, which could make it more difficult to identify the issue.

DONE.
