  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `.catch` is a method that catches errors and turns them into fulfilled promises, whereas `.dispatch` is a method that dispatches a method on an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).throw
```
This would result in different behavior because `.throw` is a method that throws an error, whereas `.dispatch` is a method that dispatches a method on an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).get
```
This would result in different behavior because `.get` is a method that retrieves a property from an object, whereas `.dispatch` is a method that dispatches a method on an object.

DONE.
