  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiver.directory(src, false);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a different archive than the original code, which uses the `directory` method to create a zip archive from the specified source directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiver.directory(src, true);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a different archive than the original code, which uses the `directory` method to create a tar archive from the specified source directory.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiver.file(src, false);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a different archive than the original code, which uses the `file` method to create a zip archive from the specified source file.

DONE.
