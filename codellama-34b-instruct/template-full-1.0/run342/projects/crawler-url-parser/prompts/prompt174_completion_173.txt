  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"for test purposes"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had a syntax error, which would cause the program to fail at runtime. By replacing it with a correct code fragment, the program should run but may produce different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"test purposes"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had leading and trailing spaces, which would not affect the program's runtime behavior but could change the string's value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"testing purpose"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had a plural verb, while the replacement would make it singular. Depending on the rest of the program's implementation, this could cause it to produce different results.

DONE.
