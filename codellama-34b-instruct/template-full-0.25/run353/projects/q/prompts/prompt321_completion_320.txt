  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) {
    return value + 1;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on a different object than the original `promise` object, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the `then` method is not implemented correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) {
    return value * 2;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called with a different callback function than the original `promise` object, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the callback function is not implemented correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) {
    return value - 1;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called with a different callback function than the original `promise` object, which could lead to unexpected behavior if
