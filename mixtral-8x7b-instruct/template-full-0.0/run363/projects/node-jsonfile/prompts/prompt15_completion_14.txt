 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `readFile` function would no longer wait for the file to be read before continuing, and could return a promise that resolves immediately with a value of `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.readFileSync
