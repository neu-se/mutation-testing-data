  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the next operation instead of the current one, which could cause the iterator to skip over operations and return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the previous operation instead of the current one, which could cause the iterator to return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index + 10]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the operation 10 positions ahead of the current one, which could cause the iterator to skip over operations and return incorrect results.

DONE.
