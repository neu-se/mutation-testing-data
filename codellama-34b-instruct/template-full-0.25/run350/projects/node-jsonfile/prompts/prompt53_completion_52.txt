  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
replacer || null
```
This would result in different behavior because if the replacer function is not provided, the original code would use the default replacer function, which is not the case with the mutated code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
replacer && null
```
This would result in different behavior because if the replacer function is provided, the original code would use it, but the mutated code would always use the null replacer function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
replacer !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because if the replacer function is not null, the original code would use it, but the mutated code would always use the null replacer function.

DONE.
