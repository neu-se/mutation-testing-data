  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.prototype.then(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with a value of `undefined` instead of the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.prototype.then(function() { throw new Error(); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with an error instead of being resolved with the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.prototype.then(function() { return Promise.reject(); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a new promise that is rejected with no reason instead of being resolved with the original value.

DONE.
