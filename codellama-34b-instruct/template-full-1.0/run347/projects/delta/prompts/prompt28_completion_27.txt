  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys().reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Object.keys()` method returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property names, in the same order as that provided by a for...in loop (the difference being that a for-in loop enumerates properties in the prototype chain as well). By calling `reverse()` on the result of `Object.keys()`, the order of the property names will be reversed, which could potentially affect the behavior of the code that relies on the result of `Object.keys()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Object.values()` method returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property values, in the same order as that provided by a for...in loop (again, the difference being that a for-in loop enumerates properties in the prototype chain as well). By using `Object.values()` instead of `Object.keys()`, the resulting array of keys will be different,
