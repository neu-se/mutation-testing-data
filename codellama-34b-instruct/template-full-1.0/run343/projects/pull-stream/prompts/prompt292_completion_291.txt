Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field, false
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `unique` would return `false` for the second occurrence of an item, whereas the original code fragment would return `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `unique` would return `null` for the second occurrence of an item, whereas the original code fragment would return `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `unique` would return `undefined` for the second occurrence of an item, whereas the original code fragment would return `true`.
