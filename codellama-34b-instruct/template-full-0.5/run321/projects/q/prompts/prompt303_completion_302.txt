  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = 1, len = answerPs.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from the second element instead of the first, potentially missing the first promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = answerPs.length - 1, len = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from the last element and decrement instead of incrementing, potentially causing an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = 0, len = answerPs.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would stop before the last element, potentially missing the last promise.

DONE.
