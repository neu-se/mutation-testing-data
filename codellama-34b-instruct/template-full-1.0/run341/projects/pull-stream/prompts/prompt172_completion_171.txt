  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(array)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `array` argument is not an array, whereas this new code fragment checks if it is an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof array === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Array.isArray(array)` to check if the `array` argument is an array, whereas this new code fragment uses `typeof array === 'object'` to check if it is an object. An array is a type of object, but not all objects are arrays.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `array` argument is not an array, whereas this new code fragment checks if the array has a length of 0.

DONE.
