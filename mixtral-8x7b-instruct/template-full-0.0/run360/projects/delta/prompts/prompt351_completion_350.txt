 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the AttributeMap.invert() method would receive null as the second argument instead of an object, which would cause an error in the invert() method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
