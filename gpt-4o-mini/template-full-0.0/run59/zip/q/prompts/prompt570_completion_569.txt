Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value, callback, errback
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly accesses the `value` property of the `result` object instead of using the `result` object directly, which could lead to unexpected results when the generator is not done.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.done, callback, errback
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `done` property of the `result` object instead of the `result` object itself, which would cause the promise to resolve with a boolean value instead of the actual yielded value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback, errback, result
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the order of the arguments passed to the `when` function, which could lead to incorrect handling of the resolved value and error callbacks.

DONE.
