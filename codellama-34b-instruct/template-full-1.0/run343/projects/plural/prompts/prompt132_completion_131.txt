  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(rule[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the result of the `test` method, causing the rule to always fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].test(word.trim())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would trim the `word` before testing it, which could cause the rule to fail even if the original word matches.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.length - rule[0].length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compute the difference between the length of the original `word` and the length of the rule's pattern, which could cause the rule to fail even if the original word matches.

DONE.
