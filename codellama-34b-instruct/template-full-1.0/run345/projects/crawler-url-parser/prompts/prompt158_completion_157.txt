  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```{=html}
<code fragment="">
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now case-insensitive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```{=html}
<code fragment=+/>
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression now includes the `+` symbol, which allows it to match one or more occurrences of the preceding token (in this case, any character) instead of zero or more.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```{=html}
<code fragment="$*">
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression now includes the `$*` symbol, which allows it to match zero or more occurrences of the preceding token (in this case, any character) until the end of the input string.

DONE.
