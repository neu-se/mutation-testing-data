  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `b` variable instead of the `a` variable, which could affect the result of the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `c` variable instead of the `a` variable, which could affect the result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the result of `2 * a` instead of the result of `a`, which could affect the result of the calculation.

DONE.
