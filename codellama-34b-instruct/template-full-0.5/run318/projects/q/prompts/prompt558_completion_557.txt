  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the argument as-is, while this modification passes the argument plus 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the argument as-is, while this modification passes the argument multiplied by 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the argument as-is, while this modification passes the string representation of the argument.

DONE.
