This would result in different behavior because the function is checking the `currentUrlStr` instead of the `baseUrlStr`, which could lead to false positives or false negatives in the URL parsing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr && _has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr.replace(/#.*$/, ''))

```
baseUrlStr && _has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr.replace(/^\/\//, 'http://'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the function is checking the `baseUrlStr` after replacing the protocol with `http://`, which could lead to false positives or
