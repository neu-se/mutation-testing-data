  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodeURI
```
This would result in different behavior because `decodeURI` only decodes the URI's escape sequences and does not decode the path separators, which may cause the file to be saved in the wrong location.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodeURIComponent(path.basename(pathname))
```
This would result in different behavior because `decodeURIComponent` only decodes the escape sequences in the pathname, and does not decode the path separators, which may cause the file to be saved in the wrong location.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename(decodeURI(pathname))
```
This would result in different behavior because `decodeURI` only decodes the URI's escape sequences and does not decode the path separators, which may cause the file to be saved in the wrong location.

DONE.
