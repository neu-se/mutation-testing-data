  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeout !== void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `timeout` is `undefined`, and if so, sets it to `Error` with the message "Timed out after " + ms + " ms", but this code fragment would skip that step and continue executing the rest of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeout !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `timeout` is `undefined`, and if so, sets it to `Error` with the message "Timed out after " + ms + " ms", but this code fragment would skip that step and continue executing the rest of the code, and it would also treat `null` as a valid timeout value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeout > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `timeout` is `undefined`, and if so, sets it to `Error`
