 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would be resolved with a null value instead of rejecting the promise. This could cause issues if the consuming code expects the promise to be rejected in certain scenarios.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject("Error")
