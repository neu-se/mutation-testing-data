  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i--])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i--` operator will decrement the `i` variable before it is used to index the `array`, resulting in a different value being returned by the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i+1])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i+1` operator will increment the `i` variable before it is used to index the `array`, resulting in a different value being returned by the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i*2])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i*2` operator will multiply the `i` variable by 2 before it is used to index the `array`, resulting in a different value being returned by the function.

DONE.
