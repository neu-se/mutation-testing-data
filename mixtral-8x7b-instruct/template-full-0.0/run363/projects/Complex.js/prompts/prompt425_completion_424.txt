 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.isInfinite()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite()` method is called on the current object instead of the input argument. This change may cause the function to behave differently or throw an error if the current complex number is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Infinity.isInfinite(this.re)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the global `Infinity` object's `isInfinite()` method, which expects a number as its argument. This change may cause the function to always return `false` for the infinite case, as the method would treat the input as a regular number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.is(this.re, Infinity)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Object.is()` method to compare the real part of the complex number with the `Infinity` value. This
