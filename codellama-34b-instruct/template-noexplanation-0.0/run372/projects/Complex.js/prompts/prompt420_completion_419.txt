  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it checks if the complex number is infinite, rather than zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']()
```
This code fragment checks if the complex number is not a number (NaN), which is different from checking if it is zero or infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']()
```
This code fragment checks if the complex number is finite, which means it is not infinite or NaN.

DONE.
