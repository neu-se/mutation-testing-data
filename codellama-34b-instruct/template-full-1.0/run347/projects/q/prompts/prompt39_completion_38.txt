  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw e;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment re-throws the error synchronously, interrupting the flushing process, while the new fragment re-throws the error asynchronously, allowing the flushing process to continue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new TypeError('Error message');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment re-throws the error synchronously, interrupting the flushing process, while the new fragment re-throws a different error message asynchronously, allowing the flushing process to continue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.error(e);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment re-throws the error synchronously, interrupting the flushing process, while the new fragment logs the error asynchronously using console.error(), allowing the flushing process to continue.

DONE.
