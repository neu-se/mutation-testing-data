 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` creates an empty object, which is not the same as using the `object` variable. This change would cause the `Q.keys` method to return an empty array instead of an array of keys from the resolved object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a special value that represents the absence of an object. Using `null` instead of the `object` variable would cause the `Q.keys` method to throw a `TypeError` when trying to access the `inspect` method on `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q` is the deferred object constructor function. Using `Q` instead of the `object` variable would cause the `Q.keys` method to return a promise for an array of keys from the `Q` constructor
