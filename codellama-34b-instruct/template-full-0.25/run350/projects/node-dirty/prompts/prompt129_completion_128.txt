  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork(false);
```
This would result in different behavior because `cork()` is a method that controls whether data should be buffered or written immediately. By passing `false` as the argument, the data would be written immediately, which could cause issues if the stream is not ready to receive the data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork(true);
```
This would result in different behavior because `cork()` is a method that controls whether data should be buffered or written immediately. By passing `true` as the argument, the data would be buffered until the stream is ready to receive it, which could cause issues if the stream is not ready to receive the data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because `cork()` is a method that controls whether data should be buffered or written immediately. By passing `null
