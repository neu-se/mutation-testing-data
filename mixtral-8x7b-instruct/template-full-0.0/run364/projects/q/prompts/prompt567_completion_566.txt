 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `when` function would receive `null` as its first argument instead of the result of the generator. This could cause the `when` function to behave differently or throw an error if it doesn't handle `null` values correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `when` function would receive an empty array as its first argument instead of the result of the generator. This could cause the `when` function to behave differently or throw an error if it doesn't handle empty arrays correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `when` function would receive an empty object as its first argument instead of the result of the generator. This could cause the `when` function to behave differently or throw an error if it doesn't handle empty objects correctly.

DONE.
