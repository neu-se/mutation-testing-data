  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is not called on the promise returned by `dispatch`, which could cause the promise to be resolved even if an error occurs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).then(deferred.resolve, deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the promise returned by `dispatch`, which could cause the promise to be resolved or rejected based on the result of the `dispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).catch(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch` method is called on the promise returned by `dispatch`, which could cause the promise to be rejected if an error occurs.
