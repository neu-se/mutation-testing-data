  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because `pageurl.host` is a string, while `pageurl` is an object with properties such as `host`, `path`, and `search`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because `pageurl.path` is a string, while `pageurl` is an object with properties such as `host`, `path`, and `search`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `pageurl.search` is a string, while `pageurl` is an object with properties such as `host`, `path`, and `search`.

DONE.
