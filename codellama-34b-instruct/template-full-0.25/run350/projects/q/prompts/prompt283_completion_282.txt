  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments.length` is a number, whereas `arguments, 1` is a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments[1]` is the second argument passed to the function, whereas `arguments, 1` is a syntax error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments[0]` is the first argument passed to the function, whereas `arguments, 1` is a syntax error.

DONE.
