  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `cos` is the cosine function, not the hyperbolic cosine function `cosh`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin` is the sine function, not the hyperbolic sine function `sinh`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `tan` is the tangent function, not the hyperbolic tangent function `tanh`.

DONE.
