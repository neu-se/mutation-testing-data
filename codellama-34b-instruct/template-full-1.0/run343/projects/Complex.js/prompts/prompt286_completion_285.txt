  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This is correct and would not result in different behaviour.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the argument passed to the cosh function, potentially returning a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a+b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the argument passed to the cosh function, potentially returning a different value.

DONE.
