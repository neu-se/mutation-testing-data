Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error && "string" !== typeof error
```
This would result in different behavior because it will reject the promise if `error` is defined and is not a string, which is the opposite of the original condition that allows for a non-string error or no error at all.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it will only reject the promise if `error` is explicitly `null`, ignoring other falsy values like `undefined` or an empty string, which would not be handled by the original condition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof error === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because it will reject the promise if `error` is an object, which is not the intended behavior of the original condition that checks for a string type or absence of an error.

DONE.
