 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the `this` context of the `field` function, potentially causing it to not work as intended if it relies on the original `this` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
('' + field)
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the `field` value to a string, which can cause unexpected results if the `field` function is expected to return a non-string value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field || true
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `field` value with `true` if it is falsy, which can cause unexpected results if the `field` function is expected to return a specific value other than `true`.

DONE.
