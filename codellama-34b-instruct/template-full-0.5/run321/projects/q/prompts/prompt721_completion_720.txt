  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Q can't get fulfillment value from any promise, all promises were rejected."))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with an error message, whereas the original code would resolve the promise with an array of promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(new Error("Q can't get fulfillment value from any promise, all promises were rejected."))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would notify the promise with an error message, whereas the original code would resolve the promise with an array of promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve([])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with an empty array, whereas the original code would resolve the promise with an array of promises.

DONE.
