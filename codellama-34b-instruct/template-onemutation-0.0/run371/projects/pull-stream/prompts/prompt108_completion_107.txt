  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!acc
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT, which returns `true` if the operand is falsy, and `false` otherwise. In the original code, `!cb` checks if `cb` is falsy, which means it is not a function. In contrast, `!acc` checks if `acc` is falsy, which means it is not a truthy value. This change would cause the code to behave differently if `acc` is a function, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
