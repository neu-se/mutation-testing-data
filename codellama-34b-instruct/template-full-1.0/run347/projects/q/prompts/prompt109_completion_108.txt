  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i > this.length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the loop infinite since the condition would always be true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i === this.length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the loop iterate only once since the condition would be true only when `i` is equal to `this.length`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = this.length; i > 0; i--
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the loop iterate in reverse order, starting from the last element.

DONE.
