  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_filter` returns a new array with the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, while `array_map` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_reduce
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_reduce` applies a function against an accumulator and each element in the array (from left to right) to reduce it to a single value, while `array_map` applies a function to each element in the array and returns a new array with the results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_forEach
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_forEach` executes a provided function once per array element, while `array_map` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

DONE.
