Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"head"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the queue to always return the head of the queue instead of moving to the next item in the queue, effectively making the queue behave incorrectly by not progressing to the next element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"tail.length"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to access the length property of the tail, which is not defined, leading to a runtime error instead of correctly retrieving the next promise in the queue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the promise to `undefined`, breaking the queue's functionality and causing subsequent calls to `get` to fail since there would be no valid promise to resolve.

DONE.
