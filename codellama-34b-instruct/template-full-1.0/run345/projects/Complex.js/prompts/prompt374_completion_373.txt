  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects the variable `b` to be used in the `Math.cos()` function, but replacing it with simply `b` would cause the function to evaluate to `Math.cos(undefined)`, which would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a + b * c
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects the variable `c` to be used in the `Math.cos()` function, but replacing it with `2 * a + b * c` would cause the function to evaluate to `Math.cos(2 * a + b * c)`, which would give a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b - c * d
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects the variable `d` to be used in the `Math.cos()` function, but replacing it with `a * b - c * d` would cause
