  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed the `cb` callback function as an argument to the `read` function, while the new code fragment passes `null` instead. This could cause the `read` function to behave differently, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed the `cb` callback function as an argument to the `read` function, while the new code fragment passes `undefined` instead. This could cause the `read` function to behave differently, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed the `cb` callback function as an argument to the `read` function, while the new code fragment passes an empty function instead. This could cause the `read` function to behave differently, potentially leading to unexpected results.

DONE.
