  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```diff.diff(strings[0], strings[1], 1);```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the character at index 1 of the first string, rather than the index 1 of the first string when transformed by the second string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```diff.diff(strings[1], strings[0], -1);```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the character at index -1 of the second string, rather than the index 1 of the first string when transformed by the second string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```diff.diff(strings[0].reverse(), strings[1].reverse(), 1);```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the character at index 1 of the reversed first string, rather than the index 1 of the first string when transformed by the second string.

DONE.
