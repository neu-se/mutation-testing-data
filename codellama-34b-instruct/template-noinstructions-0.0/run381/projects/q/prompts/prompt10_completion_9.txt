  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
define
```
This would result in different behavior because the `define` function is not defined in the provided code snippet, and its absence would cause a `ReferenceError` to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value is not a function, and attempting to call it as one would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value is not a function, and attempting to call it as one would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

DONE.
