  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const policy = policies[0];
```
This change will cause the `push` method to always set the first policy in the `policies` array as the value for the `policy` variable, instead of iterating over the array and setting the value for each policy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const policy = policies.length;
```
This change will cause the `push` method to always set the length of the `policies` array as the value for the `policy` variable, instead of iterating over the array and setting the value for each policy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const policy = policies.pop();
```
This change will cause the `push` method to always set the last policy in the `policies` array as the value for the `policy` variable, instead of iterating over the array and setting the value for each policy.

DONE.
