  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.match
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is a method that returns a boolean value indicating whether the policy matches the given path and query context, whereas `matches` is a method that returns a boolean value indicating whether the policy governs the given path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.match(path, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is a method that takes two arguments, `path` and `ctx`, and returns a boolean value indicating whether the policy matches the given path and query context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.match(path, ctx, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is a method that takes three arguments, `path`, `ctx`, and `exact`, and returns a boolean value indicating whether the policy matches the given path and query context. The `exact` argument is a boolean value that indicates whether the match should be exact or not.
