  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
++index
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the index variable, which would likely cause the iteration to skip over certain values and lead to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
--index
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the index variable, which would likely cause the iteration to go into an infinite loop or produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reset the index variable to 0, which would cause the iteration to start over from the beginning, potentially producing incorrect results.

DONE.
