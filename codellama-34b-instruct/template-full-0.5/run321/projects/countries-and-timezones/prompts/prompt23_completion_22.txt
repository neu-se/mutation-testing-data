  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(utcOffset + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getOffsetStr` function would be called with a different argument, which would produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(dstOffset)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getOffsetStr` function would be called with a different argument, which would produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(utcOffset - dstOffset)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getOffsetStr` function would be called with a different argument, which would produce a different result.

DONE.
