  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max !== Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `true` would always evaluate to `true`, while the new code fragment `max !== Infinity` would evaluate to `true` only if `max` is not equal to `Infinity`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= max
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `i > max` would be skipped if `i` is greater than or equal to `max`, while the new code fragment `i <= max` would be executed if `i` is less than or equal to `max`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < max - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `i > max` would be skipped if `i` is greater than `max`, while the new code fragment `i < max - 1` would be executed if `i` is less than `max -
