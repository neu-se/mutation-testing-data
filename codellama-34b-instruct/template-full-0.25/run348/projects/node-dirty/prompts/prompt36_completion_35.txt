  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const [key, val] of this._data.entries()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `entries()` method returns an iterator of key-value pairs, whereas the original code fragment uses the `for...of` loop to iterate over the keys of the `Map` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const key of this._data.keys()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys()` method returns an iterator of keys, whereas the original code fragment uses the `for...of` loop to iterate over the key-value pairs of the `Map` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const val of this._data.values()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `values()` method returns an iterator of values, whereas the original code fragment uses the `for...of` loop to iterate over the key-value pairs of the `Map` object.

DONE
