  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',').forEach((globPart) => {
    zipArchive.glob(globPart);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method would not be called on the `src` variable, which is a string, and would therefore not produce an array of glob patterns to be passed to the `glob` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',').forEach((globPart) => {
    zipArchive.glob(globPart, {});
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `glob` method would be called with an empty options object, which would not match any files.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',').forEach((globPart) => {
    zipArchive.glob(globPart, {cwd: process.cwd()});
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `glob` method would be called with a `c
