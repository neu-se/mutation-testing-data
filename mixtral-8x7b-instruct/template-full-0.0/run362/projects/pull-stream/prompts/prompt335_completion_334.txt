 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would receive `null` as the second argument instead of the data read from the stream. This could cause issues if the code downstream expects a non-null value and throws an error or behaves unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the data would be converted to a string. If the downstream code expects a specific data type (e.g., a number or a buffer), it would not receive the expected data type and might fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
