Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ops === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow any object (including non-array objects) to be accepted as valid input, potentially leading to unexpected behavior when the `ops` parameter is not an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops instanceof Array
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `ops` is an instance of `Array`, which may not work correctly in cases where the code is executed in different contexts (like iframes) where the Array constructor is different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly treat `null` as a valid input, leading to the constructor initializing `this.ops` to an empty array even when `ops` is explicitly set to `null`, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
