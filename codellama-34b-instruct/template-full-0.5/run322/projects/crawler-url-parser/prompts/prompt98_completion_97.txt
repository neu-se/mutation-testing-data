  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.has(currentUrl.url) && urlMap.get(currentUrl.url).text.includes(text)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only add the current URL to the `urlMap` if it is already present in the map and the text of the current URL is included in the text of the existing URL in the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.has(currentUrl.url) && urlMap.get(currentUrl.url).text.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only add the current URL to the `urlMap` if it is already present in the map and the text of the current URL is not empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.has(currentUrl.url) || urlMap.get(currentUrl.url).text.includes(text)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only add the current URL
