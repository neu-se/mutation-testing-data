 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(true, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would forcefully terminate the read operation and pass an error to the callback, even if the item passed the test.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
last ? terminate(cb) : cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the callback with the data if the `last` condition is true, instead of waiting for the next item to potentially fail the test.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the data to the callback, instead of propagating the original data or an error.

DONE.
