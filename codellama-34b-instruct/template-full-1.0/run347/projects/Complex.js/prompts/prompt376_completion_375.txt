  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment multiplies `a` with 2, while the new code fragment multiplies `b` with 2, which produces a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() * 2 * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment multiplies `a` with 2, while the new code fragment multiplies `a` with a random number between 0 and 2, which produces a non-deterministic result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 2 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment multiplies `a` with 2, while the new code fragment adds `a` with 2 multiplied by `b`, which produces a different result.

DONE.
