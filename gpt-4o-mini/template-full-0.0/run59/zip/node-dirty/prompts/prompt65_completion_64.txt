Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this._writeStream.end('error')
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of properly closing the write stream, it would end the stream with an error message, potentially causing issues in the data integrity and leading to unhandled errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this._writeStream.write('corrupted data')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to write a string 'corrupted data' to the stream instead of closing it, which could lead to data corruption and unexpected behavior in the application.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this._writeStream.destroySoon()
```
This would result in different behavior because `destroySoon()` is not a valid method for the write stream, which would lead to a runtime error instead of gracefully closing the stream, potentially crashing the application.

DONE.
