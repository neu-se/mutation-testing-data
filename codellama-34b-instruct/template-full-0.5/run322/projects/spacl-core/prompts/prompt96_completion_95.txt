  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets the value of the map to the `policy` object, while the replaced code fragment sets the value to `null`. This could cause the `query` method to return incorrect results if the `policy` object is expected to be present in the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets the value of the map to the `policy` object, while the replaced code fragment sets the value to `undefined`. This could cause the `query` method to return incorrect results if the `policy` object is expected to be present in the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name, {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets the value of the map to the `policy` object, while the replaced code fragment sets the value to an empty object. This could cause the
