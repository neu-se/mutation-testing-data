  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in a different behavior because it would cause the number of iterations in the while loop to be one greater than the length of the Delta's ops array, which would result in an index out of bounds error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in a different behavior because it would cause the number of iterations in the while loop to be one less than the length of the Delta's ops array, which would result in the algorithm skipping the last operation in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length * 2
```
This would result in a different behavior because it would cause the number of iterations in the while loop to be twice the length of the Delta's ops array, which would result in an algorithm that takes twice as long to execute.

DONE.
