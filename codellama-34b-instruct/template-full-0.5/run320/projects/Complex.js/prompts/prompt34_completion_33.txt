  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `logHypot` function would return the logarithm of the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of length `_a` and `_a`, which is always equal to `_a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_b * _a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `logHypot` function would return the logarithm of the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of length `_a` and `_b * _a`, which is always equal to `_a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_b / _a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `logHypot` function would return the logarithm of the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of length `_a` and `_b / _a`, which is always equal to `_a`.

DONE.
