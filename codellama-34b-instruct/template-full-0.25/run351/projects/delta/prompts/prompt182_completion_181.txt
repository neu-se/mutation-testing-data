  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would always return the first element of the iterator, rather than the next element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would always return the last element of the iterator, rather than the next element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would always return the next element of the iterator, but the iterator would be advanced by two elements, rather than one.

DONE.
