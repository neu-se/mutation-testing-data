  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"."
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.` operator returns the current working directory, whereas `__dirname` returns the directory of the current module.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
".."
```
This would result in different behavior because the `..` operator returns the parent directory of the current working directory, whereas `__dirname` returns the directory of the current module.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"/"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `/` operator returns the root directory of the file system, whereas `__dirname` returns the directory of the current module.

DONE.
