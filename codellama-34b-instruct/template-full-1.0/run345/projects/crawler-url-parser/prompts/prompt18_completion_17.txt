  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (typeof baseUrlStr == 'undefined') {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to only enter the `else` block if `baseUrlStr` is not defined, rather than if it is not a valid protocol.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (baseUrlStr && baseUrlStr.length > 99) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to only enter the `else` block if `baseUrlStr` has more than 99 characters, rather than if it is not a valid protocol.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (baseUrlStr[0] == '@') {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to only enter the `else` block if `baseUrlStr` starts with the character `@`, rather than if it is not a valid protocol.

DONE.
