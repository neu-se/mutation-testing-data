Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the condition to be true for positive values of `a` only, excluding zero, which may lead to different calculations for the real part of the square root.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a <= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the original condition, causing the code block for the case when `a` is non-positive to execute instead of when `a` is non-negative, potentially leading to incorrect results for the square root calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the condition to check if the imaginary part `b` is zero instead of the real part `a`, which would alter the logic for determining how to compute the square root based on the values of the complex number.

DONE.
