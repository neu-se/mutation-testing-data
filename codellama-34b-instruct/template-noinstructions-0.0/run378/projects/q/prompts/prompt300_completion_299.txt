  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all` is a function that returns a promise that is fulfilled when all of the promises in an array have been fulfilled, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a promise that is fulfilled with the value of its argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.race
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.race` is a function that returns a promise that is fulfilled when any of the promises in an array have been fulfilled, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a promise that is fulfilled with the value of its argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that returns a promise that is rejected with the specified reason, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a promise that is fulfilled with the value of its argument.

DONE.
