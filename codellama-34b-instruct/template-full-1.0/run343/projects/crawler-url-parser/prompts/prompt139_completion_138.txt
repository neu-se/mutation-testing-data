  Sure, I'm happy to provide three answers to your challenge. Here they are:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/\/[a-z]+$/, '');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is looking for a specific pattern at the end of the string (i.e. `/index.` followed by one or more characters). By replacing it with `''`, we're essentially stripping off the end of the string, which might cause the regex to match differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/\/bleh$/, '/');
```
This would result in different behavior because the pattern we're looking for has changed from `/index.` to `/bleh`. Depending on the specific input, this might cause the regex to match or not match differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/^https?:\/\/\w+\.\w+\.\w+\.\w
