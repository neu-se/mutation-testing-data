  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(a, b);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function is not called, which means that the input will not be parsed and the resulting complex number may not be correct.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(a + b, a * b);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function is not called, which means that the input will not be parsed and the resulting complex number may not be correct. Additionally, the `a + b` and `a * b` operations may not be correct for the given input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(a + b, a - b);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function is not called, which means that the input will not be parsed and the resulting complex number may not be correct. Additionally, the `a + b` and `a - b` operations may not be correct for the
