  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus|bacterium/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the new rule would match the word "bacterium" and return "bacteria" as its plural form, while the original rule would not match this word and return "bacteriums" as its plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus|bacterium|virus/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the new rule would match the word "virus" and return "viri" as its plural form, while the original rule would not match this word and return "viruses" as its plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus|bacterium
