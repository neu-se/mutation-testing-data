  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `end === false`

This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checked if the `end` argument is truthy, while this change checks if it is explicitly `false`. This could cause the function to behave differently in cases where `end` is a falsy value other than `false`, such as `0` or `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `typeof end === 'boolean'`

This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checked if the `end` argument is truthy, while this change checks if it is of type `boolean`. This could cause the function to behave differently in cases where `end` is a value of a different type, such as a string or an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `end && !(end instanceof Error)`

This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checked if the `end` argument is truthy, while this change checks if it is both truthy and not an instance of the `
