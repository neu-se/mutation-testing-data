  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would now log the value of the first latitude instead of the second latitude.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would now use the cosine of the second latitude instead of the sine.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would now use the absolute value of the second latitude instead of the second latitude itself.

DONE.
