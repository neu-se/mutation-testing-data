  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id - 1, options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different value for the `id` parameter to the `getCountry` function, potentially changing the country that is returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id, options + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different value for the `options` parameter to the `getCountry` function, potentially changing the behavior of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id, options.someProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different value for the `options` parameter to the `getCountry` function, potentially changing the behavior of the function.

DONE.
