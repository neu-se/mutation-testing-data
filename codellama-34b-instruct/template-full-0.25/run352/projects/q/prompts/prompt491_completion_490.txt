  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
untrackRejection(this);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would be called with the wrong `this` context, which could cause it to modify the wrong object or throw an error if it uses `this` inside the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
untrackRejection(promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would be called with the wrong `promise` argument, which could cause it to modify the wrong object or throw an error if it uses `promise` inside the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
untrackRejection(rejection);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would be called with the wrong `rejection` argument, which could cause it to modify the wrong object or throw an error if it uses `rejection` inside the function.

DONE.
