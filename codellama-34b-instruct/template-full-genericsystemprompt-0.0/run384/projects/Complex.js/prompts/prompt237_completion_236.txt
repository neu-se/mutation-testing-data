  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.acos` returns the arccosine of a number, whereas `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` returns the square root of a number, whereas `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random` returns a random number between 0 and 1, whereas `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number.

DONE.
