  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, so the `apply` method would fail with a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, so the `apply` method would fail with a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `false` is not a function, so the `apply` method would fail with a `TypeError`.

DONE.
