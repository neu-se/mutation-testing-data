  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in the array, which would cause the code to iterate over the ops in reverse order, potentially causing issues with the code that depends on the order of the ops.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(1)` returns a new array with all elements except the first one, which would cause the code to skip over the first element in the array, potentially causing issues with the code that depends on the first element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.filter(op => typeof op !== 'string')
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter()` returns a new array with only the elements that pass the provided filtering function, which would cause the code to only iterate over the ops that are not strings, potentially causing issues with the code that depends
