  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the formula for calculating the bearing is using the sine of the starting point's latitude (φ1) instead of the sine of the difference in latitudes (Δλ).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the formula for calculating the bearing is using the sine of the ending point's latitude (φ2) instead of the sine of the difference in latitudes (Δλ).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / cos(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the formula for calculating the bearing is using the inverse cosine of the starting point's latitude (1 / cos(φ1)) instead of the sine of the difference in latitudes (Δλ).

DONE.
