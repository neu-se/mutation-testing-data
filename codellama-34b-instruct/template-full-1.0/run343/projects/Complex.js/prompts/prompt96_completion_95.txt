  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    parser_exit();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parser_exit` function would be called, which would exit the parse function prematurely and cause undesirable behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    throw new Error();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throw` statement would cause an error to be thrown, which would be caught by the `parser_exit` function and cause it to exit the parse function prematurely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    Math.sqrt(-1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.sqrt` function is not defined for negative numbers, so it would throw a `NaN` error, which would be caught by the `parser_exit` function and cause it to exit the parse function prematurely.

DONE.
