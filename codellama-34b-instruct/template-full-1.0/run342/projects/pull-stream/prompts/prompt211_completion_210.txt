  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `(aborted)` returns a reference to the `aborted` variable, while the replacement code fragment `null` returns a null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `(aborted)` returns a reference to the `aborted` variable, while the replacement code fragment `undefined` returns an undefined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<empty string>
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `(aborted)` returns a reference to the `aborted` variable, while the replacement code fragment `<empty string>` returns an empty string.

DONE.
