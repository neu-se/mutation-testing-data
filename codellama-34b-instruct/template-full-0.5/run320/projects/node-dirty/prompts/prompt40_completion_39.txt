  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key, val) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the return value of `fn` is truthy or falsy, while this code fragment checks if it is strictly equal to `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key, val) === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the return value of `fn` is truthy or falsy, while this code fragment checks if it is strictly equal to `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key, val) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the return value of `fn` is truthy or falsy, while this code fragment checks if it is strictly equal to `false`.

DONE.
