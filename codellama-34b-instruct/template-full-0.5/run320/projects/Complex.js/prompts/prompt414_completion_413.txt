  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + Math.sqrt(a * a - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has a `+` sign before `Math.sqrt`, while this replacement has a `-` sign. This would cause the resulting value to be different, potentially leading to different behavior in the surrounding code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - Math.sqrt(a * a + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has a `+` sign before `Math.sqrt`, while this replacement has a `-` sign. This would cause the resulting value to be different, potentially leading to different behavior in the surrounding code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * Math.sqrt(a * a + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has a `+` sign before `Math.sqrt`, while this replacement has a `*` sign. This would cause the resulting value to
