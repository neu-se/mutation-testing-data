  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Q` is a function call, while `1 + 1` is a mathematical expression that evaluates to 2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Q"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Q` is a function call, while `"Q"` is a string literal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Q` is a function call, while `undefined` is a value that indicates the absence of any object.

DONE.
