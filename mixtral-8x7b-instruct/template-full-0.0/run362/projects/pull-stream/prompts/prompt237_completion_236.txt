 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the callback is now always null, which might not be the expected behavior in the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true, <PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument of the callback is now always true, which might not be the expected behavior in the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { cb(end, <PLACEHOLDER>) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback is now wrapped in an anonymous function, which might not be handled correctly in the test suite.

DONE.
