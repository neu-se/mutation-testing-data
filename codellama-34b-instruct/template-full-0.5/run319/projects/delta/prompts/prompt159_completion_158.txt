  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next(length)` would move the iterator to the next position, whereas `otherIter.peek(length)` only peeks at the next position without moving the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.next(length)` would move the iterator to the next position, whereas `thisIter.peek(length)` only peeks at the next position without moving the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peek(length)` would only peek at the next position without moving the iterator, whereas `otherIter.next(length)` would move the iterator to the next position.

DONE.
