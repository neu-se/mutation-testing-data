 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
d / c
```
This would result in different behavior because it may cause a division by zero error when `c` is equal to `0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / c
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different value when `c` is equal to `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
d + c
