  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.onerror` is a function that handles errors, and setting it to `null` would prevent it from being called when an error occurs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function () {};
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.onerror` is a function that handles errors, and replacing it with an empty function would prevent it from being called when an error occurs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function (error) { throw error; };
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.onerror` is a function that handles errors, and replacing it with a function that throws the error would cause the error to be thrown immediately, rather than being handled by the `Q.onerror` function.

DONE.
