  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!data
```
This would result in different behavior because `!data` (boolean not operator) would reverse the result of the `test(data)` function, causing the `cb(end, data)` function to be called with the opposite boolean value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `data * 2` would multiply the `data` value by 2, which would change the output of the `cb(end, data)` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `data`, which would cause the `cb(end, data)` function to be called with a different argument.

DONE.
