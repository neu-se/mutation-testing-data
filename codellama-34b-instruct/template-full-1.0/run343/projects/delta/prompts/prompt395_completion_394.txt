  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.retain` is not a boolean value, and it would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!thisOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if the `thisOp.delete` property is `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if `otherOp.delete` is `true`, even if `thisOp.delete` is `false`.

DONE.
