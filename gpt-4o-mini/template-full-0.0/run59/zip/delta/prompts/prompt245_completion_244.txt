Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause one extra operation to be deleted than intended, potentially leading to incorrect state in the `retDelta`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would effectively skip the deletion of any operations, resulting in `retDelta` containing all operations from `thisIter` without any deletions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to delete twice as many operations as intended, which could lead to an incorrect representation of the delta and loss of data.

DONE.
