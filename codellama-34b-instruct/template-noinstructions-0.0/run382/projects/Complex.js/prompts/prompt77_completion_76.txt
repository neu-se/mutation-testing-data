  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip over every other element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never terminate if the array is not empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never terminate if the array is not empty.

DONE.
