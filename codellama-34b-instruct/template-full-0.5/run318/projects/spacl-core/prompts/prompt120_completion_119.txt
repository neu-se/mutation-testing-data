  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx.length` would return the length of the `ctx` object, while `ctx` would return the object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx.toString()` would return a string representation of the `ctx` object, while `ctx` would return the object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx[0]` would return the first element of the `ctx` object, while `ctx` would return the object itself.

DONE.
