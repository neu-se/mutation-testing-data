  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `!map` checks if `map` is falsy, while `map === null` checks if `map` is strictly equal to `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `!map` checks if `map` is falsy, while `map.length === 0` checks if the length of `map` is equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map.hasOwnProperty('length')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `!map` checks if `map` is falsy, while `map.hasOwnProperty('length')` checks if `map` has a property called `length`.

DONE.
