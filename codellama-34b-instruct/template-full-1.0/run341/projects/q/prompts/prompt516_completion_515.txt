  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.catch(() => null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `.catch()` would catch any rejection, while the original code would only handle promise rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise = promise.then(fulfilled, (error) => error)
```
This would result in different behavior because `.then()` would handle both fulfillment and rejection while the original code would handle rejections separately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coerce(promise).then(() => null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `coerce` would handle any rejections, while the original code would only handle promise rejections.

DONE.
