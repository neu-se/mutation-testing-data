  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull.call.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` and `bind` are different methods with different uses and purposes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull.apply.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` and `bind` are different methods with different uses and purposes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` is a different method with a different purpose than `apply` and `call`.

DONE.
