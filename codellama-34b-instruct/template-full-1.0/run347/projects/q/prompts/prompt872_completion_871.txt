  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nbind(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nbind` is a function that binds a callback to a Node-style object, whereas `Q` is a function that takes a Node-style function and a callback. Using `Q.nbind` instead of `Q` would result in a different type of object being returned, and potentially different behavior in the code that uses the result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.napply(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.napply` is a function that applies an array of arguments to a Node-style function, whereas `Q` is a function that takes a Node-style function and a callback. Using `Q.napply` instead of `Q` would result in a different type of object being returned, and potentially different behavior in the code that uses the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nfbind(object)
