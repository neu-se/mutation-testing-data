  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\uFEFF/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the Unicode byte order mark (BOM) from the beginning of the string, while this code fragment removes the first character of the string if it is a Unicode BOM.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\uFEFF/, ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the Unicode byte order mark (BOM) from the beginning of the string, while this code fragment replaces it with a space character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\uFEFF/, 'ðŸ˜€'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the Unicode byte order mark (BOM) from the beginning of the string, while this code fragment replaces it with a smiley face character.

DONE.
