  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = 'GET'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deny` method would always allow the `GET` verb, regardless of whether it was previously marked as denied.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = 'POST'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deny` method would always deny the `POST` verb, regardless of whether it was previously marked as allowed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = 'PUT'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deny` method would always allow the `PUT` verb, regardless of whether it was previously marked as denied.

DONE.
