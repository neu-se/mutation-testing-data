 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
typeof op.retain === 'number' && op.attributes === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it specifically checks for the `undefined` value instead of using loose equality (`==`).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
op.retain !== null && op.retain.constructor.name === 'Number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `retain` property is an instance of the `Number` constructor, rather than just checking if it's a number primitive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
typeof op.retain === 'number' && Object.keys(op.attributes).length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `attributes` property is an empty object, rather than just checking if it's `null`.

DONE.
