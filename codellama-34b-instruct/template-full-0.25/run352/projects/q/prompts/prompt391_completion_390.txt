  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` function would not be called, and any progress notifications would not be handled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` function would not be called, and any progress notifications would not be handled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` function would be called, but it would not have any effect on the promise resolution, as it would not return any value.

DONE.
