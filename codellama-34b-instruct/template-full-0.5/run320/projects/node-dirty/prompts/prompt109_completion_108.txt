  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._emit
```
This would result in different behavior because `_emit` is a private method of the `Dirty` class, and is not intended to be called directly by users of the class. Calling `_emit` directly would bypass the usual event handling mechanism and could result in unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function that is bound to the `this` context of the current function. In this case, it would bind the `emit` function to the `this` context of the `_load` function, which is not the same as the `this` context of the `Dirty` class. This could result in unexpected behavior if the `emit` function is called with a different `this` context than it was originally intended to be called with.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit.call(this)
```
This would result
