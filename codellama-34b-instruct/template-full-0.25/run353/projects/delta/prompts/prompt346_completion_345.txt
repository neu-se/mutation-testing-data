  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operation would change the value of `opData`, potentially causing the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operation would change the value of `opData`, potentially causing the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operation would change the value of `opData`, potentially causing the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function to return a different result.

DONE.
