  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
empty string
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method returns the value stored at a key in the database, while an empty string would not return anything.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method returns the value stored at a key in the database, while `null` would not return anything.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method returns the value stored at a key in the database, while `undefined` would return a value of `undefined`, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
