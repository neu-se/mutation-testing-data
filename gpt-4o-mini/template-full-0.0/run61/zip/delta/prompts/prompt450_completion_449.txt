Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly classify an operation with a `retain` property that is a number or an object as not being a 'retain' type, potentially causing the `peekType` method to return 'insert' or 'delete' instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat any operation with a `retain` property that is explicitly `null` as a 'retain' type, which contradicts the original logic that checks for the type of `retain` being a number or an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would classify operations with a defined `retain` property (whether it's a number or an object) as not being a 'retain' type, leading to incorrect type classification in the `peekType` method.

DONE.
