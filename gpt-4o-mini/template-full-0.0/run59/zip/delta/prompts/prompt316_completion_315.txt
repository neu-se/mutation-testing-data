Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly accesses the `retain` property of the operation, which may not represent the length of the operation, leading to incorrect handling of the operation's length during the inversion process.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(0, Op.length(op) - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it reduces the length by 1, which could cause the inversion to skip or incorrectly process the last character of the operation, potentially leading to data loss or corruption.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the length of the `insert` property instead of the operation's length, which could lead to incorrect behavior if the operation is a delete or retain, as it would not accurately reflect the intended operation length.

DONE.
