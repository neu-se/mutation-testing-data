  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring method would return a new string that is missing the first character of the original string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the split, reverse, and join methods would return a new string that is the original string reversed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the toUpperCase method would return a new string that is all uppercase.

DONE.
