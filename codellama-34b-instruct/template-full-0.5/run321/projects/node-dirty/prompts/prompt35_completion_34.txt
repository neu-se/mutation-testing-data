  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, null, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value in JavaScript, and the original code would not have called the callback function if the value was `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, undefined, null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function and would cause an error when called as a callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, undefined, () => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would have called the callback function with the value `undefined`, while the new code would call the callback function with the value `() => {}`, which is a different function.

DONE.
