  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This will cause the code to always return 0, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This will cause the code to always return one more than the input length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This will cause the code to always return one less than the input length.

DONE.
