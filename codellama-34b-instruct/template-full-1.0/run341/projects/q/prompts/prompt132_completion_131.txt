  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.valueOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `valueOf` is a method that returns the primitive value of an object, whereas `toString` is a method that returns a string representation of an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasOwnProperty` is a method that returns a boolean indicating whether an object has a property with the specified name, whereas `toString` is a method that returns a string representation of an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `length` is a property that returns the number of elements in an array, whereas `toString` is a method that returns a string representation of an object.

DONE.
