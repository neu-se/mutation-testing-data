  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `array_slice(arguments, 1)` to get all the arguments except the first one, while the new code only gets the first two arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `array_slice(arguments, 1)` to get all the arguments except the first one, while the new code only gets the last argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `array_slice(arguments, 1)` to get all the arguments except the first one, while the new code only gets the first three arguments.

DONE.
