  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(data.toUpperCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because `toUpperCase()` is a method that returns the uppercase version of a string, whereas `data` is a variable that holds the data passed to the `log` function. If the data passed to `log` is not a string, it will throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(data + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `data` is a variable that holds the data passed to the `log` function, and adding 1 to it will change its value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(data.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because `data` is a variable that holds the data passed to the `log` function, and `length` is a property that returns the length of a string or array. If the data passed to `log` is not a string or array
