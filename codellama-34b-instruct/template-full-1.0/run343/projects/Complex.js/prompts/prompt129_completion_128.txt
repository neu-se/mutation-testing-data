  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` and `b` are not within the same scope in the original code, so this comparison would likely always evaluate to true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > c
```
This would result in different behavior because `c` is a different variable than `a` and `b`, so this comparison would likely always evaluate to false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b === c
```
This would result in different behavior because `a + b` is not necessarily equal to `c` in the original code, so this comparison would likely always evaluate to false.

DONE.
