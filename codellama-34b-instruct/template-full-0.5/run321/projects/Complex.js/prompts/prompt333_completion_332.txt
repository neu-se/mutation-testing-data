  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === -2
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking if `b` is equal to -2 instead of -1, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `b` is actually -1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b != -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking if `b` is not equal to -1 instead of checking if it is equal to -1, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `b` is actually -1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b == -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking if `b` is equal to -1 instead of checking if it is not equal to -1, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `b` is actually -1.

DONE.
