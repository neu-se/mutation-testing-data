  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat(rest).chop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `chop` method on the `delta` object, which is not the same as calling the `chop` method on the `rest` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat(rest).slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `chop` method on the `delta` object, which removes the last element of the array, while the new code fragment calls the `slice` method on the `rest` object, which returns a new array with the first element removed.
