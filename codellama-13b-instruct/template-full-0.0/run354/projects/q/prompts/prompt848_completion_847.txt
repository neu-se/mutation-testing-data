  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a promise that resolves to the result of the `defer` function, while the modified code fragment returns the promise returned by the `defer` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(deferred)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a promise that resolves to the result of the `defer` function, while the modified code fragment returns a promise that resolves to the result of the `Q` function applied to the `deferred` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(deferred)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a promise that resolves to the result of the `defer` function, while the modified code fragment returns a promise that resolves to the result of the `Q.when` function applied to the `deferred` object.

DONE
