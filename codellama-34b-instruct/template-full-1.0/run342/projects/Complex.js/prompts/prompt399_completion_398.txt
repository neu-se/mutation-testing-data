  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-this['acos']
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative sign would cause the result to be inverted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['acos'] + this['asin']
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of the 'asin' method would cause the result to be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['atan']
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'atan' method would use the opposite tangent instead of the hyperbolic arc tangent.

DONE.
