  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number, while `Math.round` returns the value of a number rounded to the nearest integer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number, while `Math.pow` returns the value of a number raised to the power of another number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number, while `Math.ceil` returns the value of a number rounded up to the nearest integer.

DONE.
