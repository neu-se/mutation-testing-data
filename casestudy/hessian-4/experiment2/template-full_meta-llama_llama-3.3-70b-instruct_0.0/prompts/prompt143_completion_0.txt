Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
is.undefined(obj) || (is.string(obj.$class) && is.undefined(obj.$))
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for `undefined` instead of `nullOrUndefined`, which could lead to different handling of null values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
obj === null || (is.string(obj.$class) && obj.$ === null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the strict equality operator `===` to check for null, and directly accesses the `.$` property without using the `is.nullOrUndefined` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!obj || (is.string(obj.$class) && !obj.$)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the logical NOT operator `!` to check for falsy values, which could lead to different handling of empty strings, zeros, or other falsy values.

DONE.
