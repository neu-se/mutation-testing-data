  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[this, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the `Promise.prototype` object, whereas in the original code, `void 0` was used to indicate that the function should be called with a `this` value of `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, arguments]
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments` is an object that contains the actual arguments passed to the function, whereas `array_slice(arguments, 1)` is a separate array that contains the same values, but with the first element removed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 2)` would start the array slice at the second element, whereas `array_slice(arguments, 1)` starts it at the first element.
