  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("intentional error");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the given error, whereas the original code would have called the `fallback` function with the `promise` and `op` arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(new Error("intentional error"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the given error, whereas the original code would have called the `fallback` function with the `promise` and `op` arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.resolve(new Error("intentional error"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the given error, whereas the original code would have called the `fallback` function with the `promise` and `op` arguments.

DONE.
