  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.retain` is always true, whereas `otherOp.delete` is only true if the operation is a deletion.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `!otherOp.delete` is always true, whereas `otherOp.delete` is only true if the operation is a deletion.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.attributes` is always an object, whereas `otherOp.delete` is only true if the operation is a deletion.

DONE.
