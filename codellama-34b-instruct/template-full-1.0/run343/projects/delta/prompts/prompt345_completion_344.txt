  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.invert(thisOp.attributes, baseOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the attributes of the base operation instead of the handler.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the other operation instead of the handler.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the base operation instead of the handler.

DONE.
