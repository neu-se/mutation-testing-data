  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would not be called with the correct index, leading to the unhandled rejection being tracked indefinitely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would be called with an invalid index, leading to an error being thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would be called with a negative index, leading to an error being thrown.

DONE.
