  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the imaginary part is less than 0, while the modified code checks if it is greater than or equal to 0, which will result in different conditions being met in the subsequent code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b <= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the imaginary part is less than 0, while the modified code checks if it is greater than or equal to 0, which will result in different conditions being met in the subsequent code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the imaginary part is less than 0, while the modified code checks if it is greater than 0, which will result in different conditions being met in the subsequent code.

DONE.
