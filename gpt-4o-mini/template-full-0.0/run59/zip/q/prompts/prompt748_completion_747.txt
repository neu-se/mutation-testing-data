Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(result);
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of resolving the promise with the fulfilled value, it would notify any listeners with the result, which does not fulfill the promise and may lead to unexpected behavior in promise handling.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Promise was fulfilled unexpectedly"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with a new error instead of resolving it with the fulfilled value, causing any subsequent `.then()` handlers to be skipped and leading to a failure in promise resolution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with `null` instead of the actual fulfilled value, which could lead to incorrect handling of the promise's result by any consumers expecting the original value.

DONE.
