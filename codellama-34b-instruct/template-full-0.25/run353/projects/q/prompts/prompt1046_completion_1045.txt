  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `closed.reject` would reject the promise instead of resolving it, which would cause the `get` method to fail with an error instead of returning the expected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.resolve(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because `closed.resolve(error)` would resolve the promise with an error instead of resolving it with the expected value, which would cause the `get` method to fail with an error instead of returning the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.resolve(Q.reject(error))
```
This would result in different behavior because `closed.resolve(Q.reject(error))` would resolve the promise with a rejected promise instead of resolving it with the expected value, which would cause the `get` method to fail with an error instead of returning the expected value.

DONE.
