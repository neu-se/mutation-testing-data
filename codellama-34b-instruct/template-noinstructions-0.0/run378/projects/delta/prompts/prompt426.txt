Your task is to apply mutation testing to the following code:
```
import AttributeMap from './AttributeMap';

interface Op {
  // only one property out of {insert, delete, retain} will be present
  insert?: string | Record<string, unknown>;
  delete?: number;
  retain?: number | Record<string, unknown>;

  attributes?: AttributeMap;
}

namespace Op {
  export function length(op: Op): number {
    if (<PLACEHOLDER>) {
      return op.delete;
    } else if (typeof op.retain === 'number') {
      return op.retain;
    } else if (typeof op.retain === 'object' && op.retain !== null) {
      return 1;
    } else {
      return typeof op.insert === 'string' ? op.insert.length : 1;
    }
  }
}

export default Op;

```

by replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different
behavior than the original code fragment, which was:
```
typeof op.delete === 'number'
```  

Provide three answers as fenced code blocks containing a single line of code,
using the following template:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Please conclude your response with "DONE."
