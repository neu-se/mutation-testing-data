  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if the values of `a[key]` and `b[key]` are not equal, regardless of whether they are equal or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== b[key] && a[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `true` if the value of `a[key]` is not equal to the value of `b[key]`, and `a[key]` is not `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== b[key] || a[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` if the value of `a[key]` is not equal to the value of `b[key]`, or if `a[key]` is `undefined`.

DONE.
