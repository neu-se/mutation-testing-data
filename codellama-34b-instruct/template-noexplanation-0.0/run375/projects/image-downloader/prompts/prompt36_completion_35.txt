  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
createWriteStream(dest, { flags: 'w' })
```
This code fragment creates a write stream with the `w` flag, which will overwrite any existing file with the same name. This change will cause the test to fail if the file already exists, as the `createWriteStream` method will throw an error if the file already exists and the `w` flag is used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
createWriteStream(dest, { flags: 'a' })
```
This code fragment creates a write stream with the `a` flag, which will append to an existing file if it exists, rather than overwriting it. This change will cause the test to fail if the file already exists, as the `createWriteStream` method will throw an error if the file already exists and the `a` flag is used.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
createWriteStream(dest, { flags: 'wx' })
```
This code fragment creates a write stream
