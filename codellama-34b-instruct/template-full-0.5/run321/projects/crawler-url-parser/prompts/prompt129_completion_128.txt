  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(pageurl.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `url` property of the `pageurl` object to the `parse` function, which is not the same as passing the `pageurl` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(pageurl.toString())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the string representation of the `pageurl` object to the `parse` function, which is not the same as passing the `pageurl` object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(pageurl.href)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `href` property of the `pageurl` object to the `parse` function, which is not the same as passing the `pageurl` object itself.

DONE.
