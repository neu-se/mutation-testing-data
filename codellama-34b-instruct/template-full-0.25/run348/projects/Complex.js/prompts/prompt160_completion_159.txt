  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is not defined in the `Complex` class, so it would throw a `TypeError` when called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'] = true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `isInfinite` property of the `Complex` object to `true`, which would cause the `div` method to always return `Complex['INFINITY']`, regardless of the input values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'] = false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `isInfinite` property of the `Complex` object to `false`, which would cause the `div` method to always return `Complex['ZERO']`, regardless of the input values.

DONE.
