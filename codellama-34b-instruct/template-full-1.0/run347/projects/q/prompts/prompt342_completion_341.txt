  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` call would be moved outside of the `try` block, potentially causing the promise to be resolved even if an error is thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` call would be moved outside of the `try` block, potentially causing the promise to be rejected even if no error is thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nextTick(function () {
    deferred.resolve(value);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` call would be scheduled to run on the next tick of the event loop, potentially causing the promise to be resolved after additional code has run.

DONE.
