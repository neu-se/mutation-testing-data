  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end. In this case, `unshift` would cause the function to be called with a different set of arguments, potentially leading to a failed promise resolution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` returns a new array that is the result of merging the given array with another array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of an array. In this case, `concat` would cause the function to be called with a different set of arguments, potentially leading to a failed promise resolution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` modifies an array by removing or replacing existing elements, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of an array
