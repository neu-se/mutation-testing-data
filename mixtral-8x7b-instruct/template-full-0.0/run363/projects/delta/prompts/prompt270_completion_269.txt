 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns the length of the `ops` array instead of the index provided to the `chop` method. This could lead to incorrect behavior when manipulating the delta operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns -1, which might not be a valid index for the delta operations. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors when manipulating the delta operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random() * this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a random index within the range of the `ops` array length. This could lead to unpredictable behavior when manipulating the delta operations, as it might not consistently remove the desired operations.

DONE.
