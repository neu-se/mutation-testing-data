Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 100);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the delay before the `flush` function is called, potentially causing tasks to be executed later than intended, which could lead to unexpected results in task execution order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick = function () { requestPortTick(); };
```
This would result in different behavior because it reassigns `requestTick` to call `requestPortTick` directly, which may lead to an infinite loop if `requestPortTick` is not properly defined or if it does not eventually call `flush`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestPortTick = function () { channel.port2.postMessage(1); };
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the message payload sent through the `MessageChannel`, which could affect how the receiving end processes the message, potentially leading to incorrect task execution or missed messages.

DONE.
