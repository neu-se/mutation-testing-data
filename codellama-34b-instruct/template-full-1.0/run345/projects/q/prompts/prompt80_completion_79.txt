  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `flush` would be called with a different argument, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `flush` would be called with an undefined argument, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush, "flush"
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `flush` would be called with a string argument, which could cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
