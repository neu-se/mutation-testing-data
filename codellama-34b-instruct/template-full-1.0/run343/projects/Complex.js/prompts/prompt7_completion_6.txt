  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `Math.pow`
This would result in different behavior because `cosm1` is expected to return the value of `Math.cos(x) - 1` for small `x`, but `Math.pow(x, y)` returns `x` raised to the power of `y`, which would be very different for small `x` and `y`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `Math.exp`
This would result in different behavior because `cosm1` is expected to return the value of `Math.cos(x) - 1` for small `x`, but `Math.exp(x)` returns the exponential function of `x`, which would be very different for small `x`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `x - y`
This would result in different behavior because `cosm1` is expected to return the value of `Math.cos(x) - 1` for small `x`, but `x - y` would return the difference between `x` and
