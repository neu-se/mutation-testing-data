  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb2 of cbs
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `const cb of cbs`, which destructures the `cbs` object and assigns `cb` to the value of each property in the object. In contrast, `const cb2 of cbs` would iterate over the properties of `cbs` and assign `cb2` to each property name, rather than each property value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb3 of cbs.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `const cb of cbs`, which destructures the `cbs` object and assigns `cb` to the value of each property in the object. In contrast, `const cb3 of cbs.values()` would iterate over the values of the `cbs` object and assign `cb3` to each value, rather than each property value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
