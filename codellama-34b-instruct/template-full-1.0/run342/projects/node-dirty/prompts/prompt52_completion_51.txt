  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val
```
This would result in different behavior because `val` is the parameter passed to the `update` method, while `key` is the key associated with the value in the database. Using `val` instead of `key` would result in the database updating the wrong key, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof key
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof key` is a string, while `key` is an object. Using `typeof key` instead of `key` would result in the database updating the wrong object, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid key in the database, while `key` is a valid key. Using `null` instead of `key` would result in the database throwing an error, leading to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
