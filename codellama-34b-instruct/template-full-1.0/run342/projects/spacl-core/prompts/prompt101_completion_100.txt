  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks whether the verb is equal to a specific value, while this new code checks whether the lowercase version of the verb is equal to a specific value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb + "!"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks whether the verb is equal to a specific value, while this new code checks whether the verb is equal to a specific value followed by an exclamation mark.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks whether the verb is equal to a specific value, while this new code checks the length of the verb.

DONE.
