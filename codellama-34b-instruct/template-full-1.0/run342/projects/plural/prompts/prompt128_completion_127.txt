  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = rules.length
```
This would result in an infinite loop, as the loop condition would never be met.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = rules.length - 1
```
This would result in an off-by-one error, as the loop would skip the last rule in the list.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = rules.length + 1
```
This would also result in an off-by-one error, as the loop would attempt to access the next unexisting rule in the list.

DONE.
