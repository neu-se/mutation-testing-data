  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would trigger the promise's rejection callback, whereas `deferred.notify` would trigger the progress notification callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would trigger the promise's resolution callback, whereas `deferred.notify` would trigger the progress notification callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid function and would likely throw an exception when invoked, whereas `deferred.notify` is a valid function that would trigger the progress notification callback if it were provided as an argument to `Q.tap()`.

DONE.
