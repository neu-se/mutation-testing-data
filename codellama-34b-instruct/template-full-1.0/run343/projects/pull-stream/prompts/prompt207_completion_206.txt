  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`toss`
```
This would result in different behavior because `toss` is a different keyword in JavaScript, and it would cause a syntax error in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`abortCb()`
```
This would result in different behavior because `abortCb()` is a function call, and it would change the control flow of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`{abortCb}`
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the type of the variable `abortCb`, and it would potentially cause errors in the program.

DONE.
