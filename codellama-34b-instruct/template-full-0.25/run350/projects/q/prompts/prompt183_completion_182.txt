  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1[1] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `attempt1` array has at least two elements, while this new code fragment checks if the second element of the `attempt1` array is not `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `attempt1` array has at least two elements, while this new code fragment checks if the length of the `attempt1` array is greater than one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1[1] !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the second element of the `attempt1` array is not `undefined`, while this new code fragment checks if the second element of the `attempt1` array is not `null`.

DONE.
