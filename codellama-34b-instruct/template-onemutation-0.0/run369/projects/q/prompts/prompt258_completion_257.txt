  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(function() { return value; });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is not called on the original promise, but on the promise returned by `Q(value)`. This could cause the promise to be resolved with a different value than expected.

DONE.
