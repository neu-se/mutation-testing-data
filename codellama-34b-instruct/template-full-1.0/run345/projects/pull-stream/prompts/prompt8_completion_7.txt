  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sources
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the `sources` object instead of the `sinks` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinks.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the length of the `sinks` array instead of the `sinks` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throughs.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the length of the `throughs` array instead of the `sinks` object.

DONE.
