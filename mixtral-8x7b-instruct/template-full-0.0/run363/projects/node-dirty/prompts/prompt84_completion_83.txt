 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty line will not be considered as a new row separator, causing potential issues when parsing the data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\n'
```
This would result in different behavior because the backslash before the 'n' will prevent it from being interpreted as a newline character, causing issues in the JSON parsing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'<PLACEHOLDER>'
