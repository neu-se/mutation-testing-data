 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned Complex object would have a zero value for the imaginary part, instead of using the original `a` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the real part of the current Complex object, even if the imaginary part is not zero, which is not the same as using the `a` variable from the function's scope.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the reciprocal of `a` before using it, which is not the same as using the original `a` value directly.

DONE.
