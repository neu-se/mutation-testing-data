  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a valid value in JavaScript, and it would be passed as the first argument to the callback function, which would cause the function to return `undefined` instead of the expected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value in JavaScript, and it would be passed as the first argument to the callback function, which would cause the function to return `null` instead of the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a valid value in JavaScript, and it would be passed as the first argument to the callback function, which would cause the function to return `0` instead of the expected value.

DONE.
