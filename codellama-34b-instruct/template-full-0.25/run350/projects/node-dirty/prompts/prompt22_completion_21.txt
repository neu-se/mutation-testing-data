  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(() => { if (cb) cb(); this.emit('drain'); }, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` with a delay of 0 is not the same as `setImmediate`, which executes the callback immediately after the current execution context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.nextTick(() => { if (cb) cb(); this.emit('drain'); });
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.nextTick` is not the same as `setImmediate`, which executes the callback immediately after the current execution context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setImmediate(() => { if (cb) cb(); this.emit('drain'); });
```
This would result in different behavior because `setImmediate` is not the same as `setTimeout` with a delay of 0, which executes the callback after the current execution context.

DONE.
