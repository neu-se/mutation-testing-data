  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `id` parameter is expected to be a number, but `'foo'` is a string. This would cause the `getCountry` function to return a different country than the one intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `id` parameter is expected to be a number, but `null` is not a number. This would cause the `getCountry` function to return a different country than the one intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, 'bar'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `id` parameter is expected to be a number, but `'bar'` is a string. This would cause the `getCountry` function to return a different country than the one intended.

DONE.
