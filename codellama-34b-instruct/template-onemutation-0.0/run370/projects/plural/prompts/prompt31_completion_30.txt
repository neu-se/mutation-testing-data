  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `substr` to remove the last two characters of the word, while the new code fragment uses `substr` to remove the last character of the word. This would cause the plural form of words that end in "y" to be incorrect.

DONE.
