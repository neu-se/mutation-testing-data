  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(-φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `cos(φ1)`, which computes the cosine of `φ1`, whereas `cos(-φ1)` computes the cosine of the negative of `φ1`. The negative sign changes the direction of the cosine function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `cos(φ1)`, which computes the cosine of `φ1`, whereas `sin(φ1)` computes the sine of `φ1`. The sine function has a different shape than the cosine function, resulting in different behavior for the overall computation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ1) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `cos(φ1)`, which computes the cosine of `φ1`, whereas `cos(φ
