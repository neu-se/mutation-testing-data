  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty string is not a valid URL protocol, which would cause the URL parsing to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http:'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'http:' is not a valid URL protocol, which would cause the URL parsing to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'httpz:'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'httpz:' is not a valid URL protocol, which would cause the URL parsing to fail.

DONE.
