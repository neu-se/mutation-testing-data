Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'wrong/path'
```
This would result in different behavior because it will always evaluate to `false` in the `isGlob` check, causing the code to skip the permission check for the `src` path, potentially leading to errors when trying to access a non-existent or inaccessible directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src + '/*'
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the `src` path to include a wildcard, which may cause the `isGlob` function to return `true`, leading to the code treating the `src` as a glob pattern instead of a direct path, potentially resulting in unexpected behavior during the zipping process.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.length > 0 ? src : 'default/path'
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a fallback to a default path if `src` is an empty string, which could lead to the code attempting to access a default directory instead of the intended source directory, potentially causing permission errors or incorrect file handling.

DONE.
