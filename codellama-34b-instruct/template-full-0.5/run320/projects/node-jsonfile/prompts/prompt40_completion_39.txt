  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromCallback` is a different function than `universalify.fromPromise` and would not return a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFile).bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFile).bind(null)` is a different function than `universalify.fromPromise` and would not return a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromPromise.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromPromise.bind(null)` is a different function than `universalify.fromPromise` and would not return a promise.

DONE.
