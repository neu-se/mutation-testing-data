Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//, 'ftp://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the protocol from 'http://' to 'ftp://', which could lead to incorrect URL parsing and resolution for web URLs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//, 'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces all URLs starting with '//' to use 'https://' instead of 'http://', potentially altering the intended protocol and affecting security and accessibility.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//, 'http://example.com/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the protocol with a specific domain ('http://example.com/') instead of just the protocol, which could lead to incorrect base URL resolution and unintended URL transformations.

DONE.
