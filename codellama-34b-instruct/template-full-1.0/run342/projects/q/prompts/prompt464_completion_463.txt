  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would always evaluate to `false`, and the `else` block would never be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typename
```
This would result in different behavior because `typename` is not a variable in the program, and the if statement would always evaluate to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"abc"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"abc"` is a string literal, and the if statement would always evaluate to `false`.

DONE.
