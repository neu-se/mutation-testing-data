  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0 instead of the actual value stored at the given key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the value stored at the key one position after the given key, instead of the actual value stored at the given key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the value stored at the given key plus one, instead of the actual value stored at the given key.

DONE.
