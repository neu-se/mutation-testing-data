  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.attributes.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of the `attributes` object is a number, whereas the original code fragment returns the `attributes` object itself. This could cause issues if the `attributes` object is used in a context where a number is expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.attributes.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method of the `attributes` object returns a string representation of the object, whereas the original code fragment returns the `attributes` object itself. This could cause issues if the `attributes` object is used in a context where a string is expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.attributes.toJSON()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toJSON()` method of the `attributes` object returns a JSON representation of the object, whereas the original code fragment returns the `attributes` object itself. This could cause issues if
