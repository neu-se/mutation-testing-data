  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument passed to `peekLength` would not be the same as the actual length of the current operation, which can cause the iterator to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength() === <PLACEHOLDER>;
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison would not be done correctly, causing the iterator to return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength() > <PLACEHOLDER>;
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison would not be done correctly, causing the iterator to return incorrect results.

DONE.
