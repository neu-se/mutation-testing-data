Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'0'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append a '0' to the end of the string instead of removing trailing zeros, potentially changing the output of the `parseValue` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
val
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not remove the trailing zeros from the string, potentially changing the output of the `parseValue` function and affecting the parsing of numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'.'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append a decimal point to the end of the string, potentially changing the output of the `parseValue` function and causing errors when parsing numbers.

DONE.
