  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise, progressListeners[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `progressListeners` is an empty array, so `progressListeners[0]` would be `undefined`, causing the `promiseDispatch` method to be called with `undefined` as the first argument instead of `newPromise`. Additionally, the `message` variable is now never used, which could potentially cause issues with the code's functionality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages[0], message
```
This would result in different behavior because `messages` is an empty array, so `messages[0]` would be `undefined`, causing the `promiseDispatch` method to be called with `undefined` as the first argument instead of `newPromise`. Additionally, the `progressListeners` array is now never used, which could potentially cause issues with the code's functionality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise + message
```
