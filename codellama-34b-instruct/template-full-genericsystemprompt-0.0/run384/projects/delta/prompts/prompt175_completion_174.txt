  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to be incremented, potentially causing the `thisIter` to be skipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `thisIter` to be incremented by one more than the `otherIter`, potentially causing the `otherIter` to be skipped.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `thisIter` and `otherIter` to be incremented by the maximum of their lengths, potentially causing one or both of them to be skipped.

DONE.
