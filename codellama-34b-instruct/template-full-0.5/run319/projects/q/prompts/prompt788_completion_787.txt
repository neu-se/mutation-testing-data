  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether the given promise is rejected, while replacing it with `null` would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the value `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether the given promise is rejected, while replacing it with `undefined` would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the value `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject("error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether the given promise is rejected, while replacing it with `Q.reject("error")` would cause the promise to be rejected with the reason "error".

DONE.
