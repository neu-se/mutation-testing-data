  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative sign would flip the sign of the angle, causing the complex number to have a different argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the angle would be increased by 1, causing the complex number to have a different argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the angle would be doubled, causing the complex number to have a different argument.

DONE.
