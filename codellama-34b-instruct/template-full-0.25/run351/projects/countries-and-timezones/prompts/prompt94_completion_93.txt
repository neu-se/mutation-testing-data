  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId + options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the `options` object to the `countryId` variable, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId - options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the `options` object from the `countryId` variable, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId * options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the `countryId` variable by the `options` object, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
