  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/at ([^ ]+):(\d+):(?:\d+)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now matching a different pattern, and the `exec` method would return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/at ([^ ]+):(\d+):(?:\d+)$/.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` method returns a boolean indicating whether the regular expression matches the input string, whereas the `exec` method returns an array of matches.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/at ([^ ]+):(\d+):(?:\d+)$/.match
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match` method returns an array of matches, whereas the `exec` method returns an array of matches and the `test` method returns a boolean.

DONE.
