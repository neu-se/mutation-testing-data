  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, args, 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument `1` would be passed to the `dispatch` method, which would cause it to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, args, "foo"]
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument `"foo"` would be passed to the `dispatch` method, which would cause it to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, args, function() { return "bar"; }]
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument `function() { return "bar"; }` would be passed to the `dispatch` method, which would cause it to behave differently.

DONE.
