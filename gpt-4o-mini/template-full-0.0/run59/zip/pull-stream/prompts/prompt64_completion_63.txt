Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly calls the `done` callback with the `data` instead of the `end` value, which may lead to unexpected results or errors in the handling of the stream's end condition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it always passes `true` to the `done` callback, regardless of the actual end condition, which could mislead the caller into thinking the operation completed successfully even when it did not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it always calls the `done` callback with `null`, indicating no error, even when there is an actual error present, which could cause the caller to miss handling an error condition properly.

DONE.
