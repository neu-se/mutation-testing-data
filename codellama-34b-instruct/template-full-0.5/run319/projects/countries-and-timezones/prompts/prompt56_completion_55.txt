  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones, { deprecated: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return all timezones, including deprecated ones, instead of only returning the non-deprecated timezones.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones, { deprecated: false }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return non-deprecated timezones, instead of returning all timezones.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones, { deprecated: !deprecated }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the `deprecated` flag, so deprecated timezones would be returned instead of non-deprecated timezones.

DONE.
