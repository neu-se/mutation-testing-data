  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `exception` is a variable that contains an exception object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw exception
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is a keyword that throws an exception, whereas `reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because `return` is a keyword that returns a value from a function, whereas `reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise.

DONE.
