  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextOp` is an object with an `insert` property, and `nextOp.insert` would refer to the `insert` property of that object. In the original code, the `nextOp` variable is used as an argument to the `OpIterator.next` method, which is likely to have a different behavior than passing the `insert` property of an object to that method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextOp` is an object with a `delete` property, and `nextOp.delete` would refer to the `delete` property of that object. In the original code, the `nextOp` variable is used as an argument to the `OpIterator.next` method, which is likely to have a different behavior than passing the `delete` property of an object to that method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
