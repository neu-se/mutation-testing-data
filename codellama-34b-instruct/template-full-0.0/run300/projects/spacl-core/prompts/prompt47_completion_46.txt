  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/:.*/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator matches zero or more characters, whereas the `+` operator matches one or more characters. This change would cause the regular expression to match a path with zero or more characters after the last `/`, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/:.+/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator matches one or more characters, whereas the `*` operator matches zero or more characters. This change would cause the regular expression to match a path with one or more characters after the last `/`, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/:.{1,}/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `{1,}` quantifier matches one or more characters, whereas the `+` operator matches one or more characters. This change would cause the regular expression to match a path with one or more characters after the last `/`,
