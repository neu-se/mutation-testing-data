  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was expecting a promise to be returned, but `null` is not a promise and would cause the code to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was expecting a promise to be returned, but `undefined` is not a promise and would cause the code to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("Something went wrong"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was expecting a promise to be returned, but `Q.reject()` returns a rejected promise, which would cause the code to fail.

DONE.
