  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === "undefined" && typeof module === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the condition, causing the code to only execute when `exports` and `module` are undefined, rather than when they are defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === "function" && typeof module === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `exports` and `module` are functions, rather than objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === "object" && typeof module === "object" && exports.module === "module"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `exports` and `module` are objects and if `exports.module` is equal to the string "module".

DONE.
