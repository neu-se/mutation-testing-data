  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `props.slice()` returns a shallow copy of the `props` array, while `props.reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in the `props` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `props.concat()` returns a new array that is the result of concatenating the `props` array with the argument passed to it, while `props.reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in the `props` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `props.pop()` removes the last element from the `props` array and returns it, while `props.reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in the `props` array.

DONE.
