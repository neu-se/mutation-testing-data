  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would concatenate the contents of `other.ops` to the `delta` object, while the modified code would not do anything if the length of `other.ops` is less than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would concatenate the contents of `other.ops` to the `delta` object, while the modified code would not do anything if the length of `other.ops` is equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would concatenate the contents of `other.ops` to the `delta` object, while the modified code would not do anything if the length of `other.ops` is greater than 1.

DONE.
