  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the truthiness of `end`, which means that the `if` statement would always evaluate to `true` regardless of the value of `end`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would always evaluate to `false` if `end` is truthy, which means that the `if` statement would always evaluate to `false` regardless of the value of `end`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would always evaluate to `true` if `end` is truthy, which means that the `if` statement would always evaluate to `true` regardless of the value of `end`.

DONE.
