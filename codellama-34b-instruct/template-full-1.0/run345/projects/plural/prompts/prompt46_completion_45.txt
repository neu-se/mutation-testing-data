  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]o$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match words that do not contain the vowel "y" before the "o" at the end of the word, whereas the original code fragment matches words that do contain the vowel "y" before the "o".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiou]o$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match words that contain the vowel "y" before the "o" at the end of the word, whereas the original code fragment matches words that do not contain the vowel "y".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[aeiouy]o$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only match words that start with a vowel and end with "o", whereas the original code fragment matches words that end with "o" regardless of whether they start with a vowel or not
