  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra character to the length of the peeked operation, which could cause the code to skip over a character that it should not have.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract an extra character from the length of the peeked operation, which could cause the code to miss a character that it should have included.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the length of the peeked operation, which could cause the code to include characters that it should not have included, or to miss characters that it should have included.

DONE.
