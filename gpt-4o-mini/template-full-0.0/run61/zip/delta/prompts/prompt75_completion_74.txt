Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp = { ...newOp };
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of `newOp`, which means that if `newOp` contains nested objects, those nested objects will still reference the original objects rather than being fully independent copies.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because setting `newOp` to `null` would cause the subsequent logic that relies on `newOp` being an object to fail, potentially leading to runtime errors or unexpected behavior when trying to access properties of `newOp`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp = { ...newOp, insert: 'modified' };
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the `insert` property of `newOp` to a fixed string 'modified', which would change the intended operation and could lead to incorrect behavior when processing the operations in the `ops` array.

DONE.
