  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goat'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'goat' is a different word than 'goose', and the pluralization rules for the two words are different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'geese'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'geese' is already the plural form of 'goose', and the pluralization rules would not be applied.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'gooses'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'gooses' is not a valid plural form of 'goose', and the pluralization rules would not be applied.

DONE.
