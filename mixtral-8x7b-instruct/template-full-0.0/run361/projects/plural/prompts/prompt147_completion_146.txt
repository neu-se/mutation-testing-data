 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
rule[1].call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the context (`this`) of the function to the current object, which might not be the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
rule[1].bind(this)()
