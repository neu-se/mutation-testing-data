  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would cause the `array_slice` function to return an empty array, while `0` would cause it to return an array with the first element of the `arguments` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would cause the `array_slice` function to return an array with the first element of the `arguments` object, while `-1` would cause it to return an empty array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would cause the `array_slice` function to return an array with the first two elements of the `arguments` object, while `2` would cause it to return an array with the first three elements.

DONE.
