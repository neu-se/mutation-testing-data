  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index >= this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the index is now always greater than or equal to the length of the `ops` array, which would result in the `push` method returning `undefined`, instead of a reference to the current delta object, which could cause unintended consequences in the code that uses this method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index === this.ops.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the index is now always equal to the length of the `ops` array minus one, which would result in the `push` method returning a reference to the current delta object, but with the last operation removed, which could cause unintended consequences in the code that uses this method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < this.ops.length / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the index is now always less than half the length of the `ops` array, which would
