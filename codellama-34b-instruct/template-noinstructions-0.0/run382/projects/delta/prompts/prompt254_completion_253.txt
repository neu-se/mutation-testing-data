  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always consume one operation from the other iterator, even if it was not needed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always consume all remaining operations from the other iterator, even if they were not needed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(Math.min(otherIter.peekLength(), length))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consume a variable number of operations from the other iterator, depending on the length of the current operation and the remaining operations in the other iterator.

DONE.
