  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` variable is not defined, and the `args` variable is defined earlier in the function as `array_slice(arguments, 2)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs.concat(args)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `nodeArgs` and `args` arrays, which might not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args.concat(nodeArgs)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `args` and `nodeArgs` arrays, which might not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
