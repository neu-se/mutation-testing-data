  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isZero']() && z['isZero']()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `this` and `z` are both zero, while this new code fragment only checks if `this` is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `this` or `z` is infinite, while this new code fragment only checks if `this` is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isZero']() || z['isZero']()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `this` and `z` are both zero, while this new code fragment only checks if `this` or `z` is zero.

DONE.
