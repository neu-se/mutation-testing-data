Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it will always attempt to pop one more task than actually exists in the `laterQueue`, potentially leading to an error or unexpected behavior when trying to execute a task that doesn't exist.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it will skip the last task in the `laterQueue`, meaning that not all tasks will be executed, which could lead to missed operations or incomplete processing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it will attempt to pop twice as many tasks as are present in the `laterQueue`, which could lead to an error or cause the function to behave incorrectly by trying to execute non-existent tasks.

DONE.
