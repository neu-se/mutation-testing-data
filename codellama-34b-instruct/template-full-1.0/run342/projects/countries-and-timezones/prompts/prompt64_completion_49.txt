  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deliverCountry([], options);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls `deliverCountry` with a country ID as the first argument, while this new code fragment calls it with an empty array. This would cause the `deliverCountry` function to return `null` instead of the expected country object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deliverCountry(country, { deprecated: true });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls `deliverCountry` without any options, while this new code fragment calls it with the `deprecated` option set to `true`. This would cause the `deliverCountry` function to return a country object with deprecated timezones included, rather than the expected subset of non-deprecated timezones.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deliverTimezones(null, options);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls `deliverCountry
