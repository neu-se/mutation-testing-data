  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
min < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the compiler would allow incorrectly formed path specifications to pass through, since the condition would always be true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
any >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the compiler would allow incorrectly formed path specifications to pass through, since the condition would always be true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
any < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the compiler would not allow any path specifications to pass through, since the condition would always be false.

DONE.
