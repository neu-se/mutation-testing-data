  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the backslash character is not a valid separator in a URL, and the `replace` method would not be able to find any matches.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the space character is not a valid separator in a URL, and the `replace` method would not be able to find any matches.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty string is not a valid separator in a URL, and the `replace` method would not be able to find any matches.

DONE.
