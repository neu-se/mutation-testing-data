  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `φ1` value is used instead of `φ2`, which would cause the calculation of the bearing to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 + π
```
This would result in different behavior because the `φ2` value is increased by `π`, which would cause the calculation of the bearing to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 - π
```
This would result in different behavior because the `φ2` value is decreased by `π`, which would cause the calculation of the bearing to be incorrect.

DONE.
