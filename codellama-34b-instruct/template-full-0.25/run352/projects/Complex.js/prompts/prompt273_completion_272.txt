  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the imaginary part of the complex number instead of the real part, which could lead to incorrect results in the calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the real part of the complex number, which could lead to incorrect results in the calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the real part of the complex number, which could lead to incorrect results in the calculations.

DONE.
