  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment recursively calls the `next` function with the result of `read`, which is a function that takes a callback as an argument. By replacing it with `next(null)`, the `read` function will not be called, and the `next` function will not be recursively called, resulting in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment recursively calls the `next` function with the result of `read`, which is a function that takes a callback as an argument. By replacing it with `next(undefined)`, the `read` function will not be called, and the `next` function will not be recursively called, resulting in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment recursively calls the `next` function with
