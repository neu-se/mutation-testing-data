  DONE.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(array)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `array` variable is not an array, while the new code fragment checks if it is an array. This change would cause the `if` statement to behave differently, potentially leading to different execution paths in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray(array)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `array` variable is not an array, while the new code fragment checks if it is an array. This change would cause the `if` statement to behave differently, potentially leading to different execution paths in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `array` variable is not an array, while the new code fragment checks if its length is equal to zero. This change would
