  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFile
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFile` is an asynchronous function that returns a promise, whereas `fs.writeFileSync` is a synchronous function that returns undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync(file, str, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFileSync` takes a different set of arguments than `fs.writeFile`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync(file, str, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFileSync` is a synchronous function that blocks the event loop until the file is written, whereas `fs.writeFile` is an asynchronous function that returns a promise that resolves when the file is written.

DONE.
