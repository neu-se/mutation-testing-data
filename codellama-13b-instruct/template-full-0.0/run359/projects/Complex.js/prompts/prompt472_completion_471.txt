  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite` function returns `true` if the argument is a finite number, and `false` otherwise. In the original code, `isFinite` is used to check if the real part of the complex number is finite, but in this case, it would be used to check if the complex number is finite in general.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` function returns `true` if the argument is `NaN`, and `false` otherwise. In the original code, `isNaN` is used to check if the real part of the complex number is `NaN`, but in this case, it would be used to check if the complex number is `NaN` in general.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isInfinite
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` function returns `true` if the
