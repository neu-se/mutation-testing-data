  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'Invalid Param'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws a `SyntaxError`, while replacing it with a string would result in a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws a `SyntaxError`, while replacing it with an empty object would result in a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('Invalid Param')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws a `SyntaxError`, while replacing it with a `new Error` would result in a different error being thrown.

DONE.
