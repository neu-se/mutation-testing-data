  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the fourth argument passed to the `pull` function would be `ref[3]`, instead of `ref[2]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[2], ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument passed to the `pull` function would be `ref[2]`, instead of `ref[1]`.

DONE.
