  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `arguments` object has a length of 2, while this new code fragment checks if it has a length of 1. This change would cause the function to behave differently when it is called with a different number of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length === 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `arguments` object has a length of 2, while this new code fragment checks if it has a length of 3. This change would cause the function to behave differently when it is called with a different number of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `arguments` object has a length of 2, while this new code fragment checks if it has a length of 0. This change would cause
