  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spread` function expects a rejected promise, but if `fulfilled` is used instead, it will try to call `apply` on the resolved value, which may not be a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spread` function expects a rejected promise, but if `undefined` is used instead, it will try to call `apply` on `undefined`, which will throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spread` function expects a rejected promise, but if `null` is used instead, it will try to call `apply` on `null`, which will throw an error.

DONE.
