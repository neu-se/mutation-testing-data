  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `θ` variable is used to calculate the bearing between two points, and adding 1 to it would shift the bearing by 1 degree.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * θ
```
This would result in different behavior because the `θ` variable is used to calculate the bearing between two points, and multiplying it by 2 would double the bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `θ` variable is used to calculate the bearing between two points, and subtracting 1 from it would shift the bearing by -1 degree.

DONE.
