  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler == null
```
This would result in different behavior because `handler == null` would always evaluate to `false` if `handler` is a function, even if the function does not exist or is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `handler.length` would always evaluate to `undefined` if `handler` is a function, even if the function does not exist or is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof handler === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof handler` would always evaluate to `'function'` if `handler` is a function, even if the function does not exist or is not defined.

DONE.
