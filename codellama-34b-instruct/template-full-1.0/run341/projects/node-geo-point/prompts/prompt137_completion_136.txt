  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3-this.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment, `adjust(this.longitude)`, returns a value that is parsed to a fixed number of precision points, while `3-this.longitude` subtracts 3 from the longitude value and returns the result, which may be different from the original value if the longitude is less than 3.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x*this.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment, `adjust(this.longitude)`, returns a value that is parsed to a fixed number of precision points, while `x*this.longitude` multiplies the longitude value by a factor `x` and returns the result, which may be different from the original value if `x` is not equal to 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude/this.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the
