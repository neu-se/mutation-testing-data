  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === "function" && define.amd && define.amd.isNodeJS
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `define` function is defined, if it has an `amd` property, and if that property has an `isNodeJS` property, which is not present in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === "function" && define.amd && define.amd.isNodeJS === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `define` function is defined, if it has an `amd` property, and if that property has an `isNodeJS` property that is set to `false`, which is not present in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === "function" && define.amd && define.amd.isNodeJS !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `define` function is defined
