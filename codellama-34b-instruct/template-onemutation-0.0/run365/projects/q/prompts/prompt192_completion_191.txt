  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split("@")[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a regular expression to extract the file name and line number from the stack trace, while the new code fragment uses string manipulation to extract the file name and line number. The regular expression is more robust and can handle stack traces with different formats, while the string manipulation may produce incorrect results if the stack trace has a different format.
