  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the number of in-flight writes is less than or equal to 0, while this new code checks if it is strictly less than 0. If the number of in-flight writes is 0, the original code would enter the `if` block and emit the `drain` event, while the new code would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the number of in-flight writes is less than or equal to 0, while this new code checks if it is greater than 0. If the number of in-flight writes is 0, the original code would enter the `if` block and emit the `drain` event, while the new code would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
