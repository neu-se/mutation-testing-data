  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType && embedType === Object.keys(b)[0];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the logical OR operator (`||`), which checks if either expression is truthy. In this suggestion, the logical AND operator (`&&`) is used instead, which checks if both expressions are truthy. If the first expression is falsy, the second expression will not be evaluated, which means that the `embedType !== Object.keys(b)[0]` check will not be performed. As a result, the `throw new Error()` statement will not be executed, and the rest of the code will continue executing as if there were no error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!embedType || embedType !== Object.keys(b)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the logical OR operator (`||`), which checks if either expression is truthy. In this suggestion, the logical NOT operator (`!`) is used on the first expression, which inverts the result of
