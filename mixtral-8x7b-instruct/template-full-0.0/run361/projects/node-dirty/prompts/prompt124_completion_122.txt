 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._queue.size - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prevent the last item in the queue from being flushed when the writable stream is drained.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._queue.clear()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately clear the queue, discarding any pending write operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._queue.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the keys of the queue to the `_flush` method instead of the actual queue entries, causing incorrect data to be written to the file.

DONE.
