  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0 != d
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!=` operator checks for inequality, whereas `===` checks for strict equality. In this case, the `div` function would return different results for inputs with negative real parts.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d != 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!=` operator checks for inequality, whereas `===` checks for strict equality. In this case, the `div` function would return different results for inputs with negative real parts.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `>=` operator checks for greater than or equal to, whereas `===` checks for strict equality. In this case, the `div` function would return different results for inputs with negative real parts.

DONE.
