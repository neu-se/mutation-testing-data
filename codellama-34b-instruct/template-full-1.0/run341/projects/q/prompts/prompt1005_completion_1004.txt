  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object[name]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the dispatch method, which is not a property of the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.call(name)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the dispatch method, which is not a property of the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.apply(name, nodeArgs)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the dispatch method, which is not a property of the object.

DONE.
