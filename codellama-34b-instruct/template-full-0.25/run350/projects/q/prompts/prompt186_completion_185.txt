  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/at ([^ ]+):(\d+):(?:\d+)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and it may match a different part of the stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/at ([^ ]+):(\d+):(?:\d+)$/.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` method returns a boolean indicating whether the regular expression pattern matches the string, whereas the `exec` method returns an array of matches.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/at ([^ ]+):(\d+):(?:\d+)$/.search
```
This would result in different behavior because the `search` method returns the index of the first match in the string, whereas the `exec` method returns an array of matches.

DONE.
