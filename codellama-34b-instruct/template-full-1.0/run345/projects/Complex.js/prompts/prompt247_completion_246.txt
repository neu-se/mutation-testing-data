  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would square the imaginary part of the complex number, which would change the result of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would square the real part of the complex number, which would change the result of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, which would change the result of the function.

DONE.
