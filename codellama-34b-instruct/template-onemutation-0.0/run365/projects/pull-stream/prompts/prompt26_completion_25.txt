  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only passes 3 arguments to the `pull` function, while this new code fragment passes 4 arguments. This could potentially cause the `pull` function to behave differently, depending on its implementation.

DONE.
