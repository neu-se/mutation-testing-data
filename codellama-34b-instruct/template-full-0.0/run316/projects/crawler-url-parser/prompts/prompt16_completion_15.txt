  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the first occurrence of `#` with an empty string, while the new code fragment replaces the last occurrence of `#` with an empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#' + ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the first occurrence of `#` with an empty string, while the new code fragment replaces the first occurrence of `#` with a space character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#' + ' ' + ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the first occurrence of `#` with an empty string, while the new code fragment replaces the first occurrence of `#` with two space characters.

DONE.
