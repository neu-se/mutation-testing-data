  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb, abort, onAbort` is expecting three arguments, but the replacement code fragment only provides two arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true, abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb, abort, onAbort` is expecting a `null` value as the first argument, but the replacement code fragment provides a `true` value instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort(abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb, abort, onAbort` is expecting a function call with three arguments, but the replacement code fragment only provides one argument.

DONE.
