  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deferred.resolve(promises)` line to be executed immediately, without waiting for all promises to be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deferred.resolve(promises)` line to be executed immediately, without waiting for all promises to be resolved, and it would also cause an error to be thrown if the `pendingCount` variable is negative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount === promises.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deferred.resolve(promises)` line to be executed only when all promises have been resolved, and it would also cause the `deferred.reject(rejection)` line to be executed if any of the promises are rejected.

DONE.
