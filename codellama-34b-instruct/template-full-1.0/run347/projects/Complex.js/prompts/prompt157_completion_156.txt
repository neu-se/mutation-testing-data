  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a == 0 && b == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if either `a` or `b` is zero, while the replacement code checks if both `a` and `b` are zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0 && b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if either `a` or `b` is greater than zero, while the replacement code checks if both `a` and `b` are greater than zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(a) > 0 && Math.abs(b) > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if either `a` or `b` is non-zero, while the replacement code checks if both `a` and `b` have the same sign.

DONE.
