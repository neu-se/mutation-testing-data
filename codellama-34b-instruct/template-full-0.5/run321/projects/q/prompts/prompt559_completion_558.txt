  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.name === "StopIteration"
```
This would result in different behavior because `isStopIteration` is a custom function that checks if the exception is an instance of `StopIteration`, while `exception.name` is a property that contains the name of the exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception instanceof StopIteration
```
This would result in different behavior because `isStopIteration` is a custom function that checks if the exception is an instance of `StopIteration`, while `instanceof` is a keyword that checks if an object is an instance of a particular class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.constructor === StopIteration
```
This would result in different behavior because `isStopIteration` is a custom function that checks if the exception is an instance of `StopIteration`, while `exception.constructor` is a property that contains the constructor function of the exception.

DONE.
