  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be accessing the wrong index in the `tokens` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be accessing a different index in the `tokens` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be adding 1 to the value of `tokens[i + 1]`, which could cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
