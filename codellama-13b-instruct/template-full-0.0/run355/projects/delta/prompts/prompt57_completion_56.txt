  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops != null && Array.isArray(ops.ops) && ops.ops.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `ops` array is not empty before accessing its `ops` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops != null && Array.isArray(ops.ops) && ops.ops[0] != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the first element of the `ops` array is not null before accessing its `ops` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops != null && Array.isArray(ops.ops) && ops.ops.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `ops` array has more than one element before accessing its `ops` property.

DONE.
