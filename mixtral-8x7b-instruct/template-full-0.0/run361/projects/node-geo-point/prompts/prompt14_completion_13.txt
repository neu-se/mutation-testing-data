 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
point.coordinates.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly validate the length of the `coordinates` array, causing the function to throw an error when it shouldn't.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.prototype.isArray
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `isArray` property exists on the `Array` prototype, rather than checking if the `coordinates` argument is an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
point.coordinates instanceof Array
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `point.coordinates` is an instance of the `Array` constructor, which would not work in all JavaScript environments (e.g., in older versions of Internet Explorer).

DONE.
