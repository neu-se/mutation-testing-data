Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `thisIter.next()` method to consume one extra operation than intended, potentially leading to incorrect transformations or skipped operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `thisIter.next()` method to consume one less operation than intended, which could result in missing transformations or incorrect handling of the remaining operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the next operation instead of the current operation's length, which could lead to incorrect transformations and potentially cause the algorithm to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
