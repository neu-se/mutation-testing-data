  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof href == "undefined" || href.length < 3 || /^(javascript|mailto:|ftp:)/ig.test(href)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `href` attribute is undefined, has a length less than 3, or starts with "javascript", "mailto:", or "ftp:". The buggy code fragment only checks if the `href` attribute is undefined or has a length less than 3.

DONE.
