  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new GeoPoint(0, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the origin point (0, 0) regardless of the input distance and bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new GeoPoint(distance, bearing);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a point with the same latitude and longitude as the input distance and bearing, instead of calculating the destination point based on the input parameters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new GeoPoint(distance * Math.cos(bearing), distance * Math.sin(bearing));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a point with a latitude and longitude that are proportional to the input distance and bearing, instead of calculating the destination point based on the input parameters.

DONE.
