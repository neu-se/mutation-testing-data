  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver !== "function"
```
This code fragment checks if the `resolver` variable is not a string with the value "function". This is different from the original code fragment, which checks if the `resolver` variable is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof resolver !== "string"
```
This code fragment checks if the `resolver` variable is not a string. This is different from the original code fragment, which checks if the `resolver` variable is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver !== "object"
```
This code fragment checks if the `resolver` variable is not an object. This is different from the original code fragment, which checks if the `resolver` variable is not a function.

DONE.
