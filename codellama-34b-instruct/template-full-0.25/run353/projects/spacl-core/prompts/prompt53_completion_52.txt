  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/([^/]+)/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the extra `/` at the end of the regular expression would cause the match to fail, even if the input string matches the pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/([^/]+)/g'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regular expression would cause the match to be global, meaning that it would match all occurrences of the pattern in the input string, rather than just the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/([^/]+)/i'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regular expression would cause the match to be case-insensitive, meaning that it would match the pattern regardless of the case of the input string.

DONE.
