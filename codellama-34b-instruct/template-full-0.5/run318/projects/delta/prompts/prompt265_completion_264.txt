  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push(otherOp).retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the same number of characters instead of deleting them, which could cause the diff algorithm to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push(otherOp).insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the same text again instead of deleting it, which could cause the diff algorithm to produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push(otherOp).delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the same text again instead of retaining it, which could cause the diff algorithm to produce incorrect results.

DONE.
