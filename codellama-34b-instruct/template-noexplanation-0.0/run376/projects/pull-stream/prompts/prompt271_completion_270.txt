  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.map(function(value) { return value + 1; })
```
This code fragment will return a new array with the values from the original `values` array, but with each value incremented by 1. This change will cause the `flatten` function to behave differently than the original code, as it will return a stream of arrays with incremented values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.filter(function(value) { return value % 2 === 0; })
```
This code fragment will return a new array with only the even values from the original `values` array. This change will cause the `flatten` function to behave differently than the original code, as it will return a stream of arrays with only the even values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.reduce(function(acc, value) { return acc + value; }, 0)
```
This code fragment will return a single value that is the sum of all
