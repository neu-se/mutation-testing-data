  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.delete(baseUrlStr);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` method is called on the `urlMap` object with the `baseUrlStr` parameter, which would remove the entry from the map. In the original code, the `urlMap` object is not modified, so the `baseUrlStr` parameter is not removed from the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set(baseUrlStr, currentUrl);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method is called on the `urlMap` object with the `baseUrlStr` parameter and the `currentUrl` parameter, which would add a new entry to the map. In the original code, the `urlMap` object is not modified, so the `baseUrlStr` parameter is not added to the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clear
