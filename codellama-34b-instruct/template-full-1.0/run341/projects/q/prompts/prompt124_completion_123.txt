  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty(object, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the index -1 as a parameter to the object_hasOwnProperty function, which would cause it to check for a property at index -1 of the object. This would cause the function to always return false, even if the property exists.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty(object, "propName")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the string "propName" as a parameter to the object_hasOwnProperty function, which would cause it to check for a property named "propName" rather than the actual property name. This would cause the function to always return false, even if the property exists.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty(object, object)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the object as a parameter to the object_has
