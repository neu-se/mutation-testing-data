 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re'] !== this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a constant false condition, making the `isNaN` method always return true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0/this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a division by zero error when the imaginary part is zero, causing the method to throw an exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
isFinite(this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for finite values instead of NaN, causing the method to return incorrect results when the imaginary part is NaN.

DONE.
