  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the boolean value of `value`, potentially causing the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `value`, potentially causing the promise to be resolved with a different value than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the value of `value`, potentially causing the promise to be resolved with a different value than expected.

DONE.
