  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is used to provide a default value for `places` in case it is undefined or null. However, if `places` is 0, the default value of 1 will be used instead, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10, places / 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the `/` operator is used to provide a default value for `places` in case it is undefined or null. However, if `p
