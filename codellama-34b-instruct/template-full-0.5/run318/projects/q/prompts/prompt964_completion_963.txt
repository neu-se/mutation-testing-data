  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `this` to refer to the current object, while replacing it with `null` would cause the function to be called with a null context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `this` to refer to the current object, while replacing it with `undefined` would cause the function to be called with an undefined context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `this` to refer to the current object, while replacing it with `0` would cause the function to be called with a numeric context.

DONE.
