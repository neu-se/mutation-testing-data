Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the current operation from `thisIter` instead of `otherIter`, potentially leading to incorrect operations being processed when composing two deltas.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use a length of zero, effectively ignoring the length of the operation from `otherIter`, which could lead to missing operations in the resulting delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increase the length by one, causing the code to attempt to process one more operation than intended from `otherIter`, which could lead to unexpected results in the composed delta.

DONE.
