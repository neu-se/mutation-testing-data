  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror.apply(null, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.onerror` is a function that is called with the error object as its first argument, but in this case, it is being called with `null` as the context and `arguments` as the argument list.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror.apply(this, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` is being passed as the context to `Q.onerror`, which may not be the same as the original context in which the function was called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror.call(null, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is being used instead of `apply`, which means that the arguments will be passed individually instead of as an array.

DONE.
