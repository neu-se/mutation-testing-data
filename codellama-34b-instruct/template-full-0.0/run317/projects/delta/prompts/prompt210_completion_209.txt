  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first element of the `ops` array, which may not be intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only include the last element of the `ops` array, which may not be intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include all elements of the `ops` array except the last one, which may not be intended.

DONE.
