  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the for loop would start from 1 instead of 0, potentially missing the first element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the for loop would start from the last element in the array instead of the first, potentially causing an unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the for loop would start from -1 instead of 0, potentially causing an out-of-bounds error.

DONE.
