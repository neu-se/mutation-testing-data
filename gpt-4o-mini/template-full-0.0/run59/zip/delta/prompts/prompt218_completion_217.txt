Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `concat` method to skip all operations from the `other` Delta, effectively resulting in a Delta that only contains the first operation of the current Delta, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `concat` method to include only the first operation of the `other` Delta, rather than concatenating all operations from the `other` Delta, leading to an incomplete result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to concatenate the `other` Delta starting from its total length, effectively resulting in an empty array being concatenated, which would not include any operations from the `other` Delta.

DONE.
