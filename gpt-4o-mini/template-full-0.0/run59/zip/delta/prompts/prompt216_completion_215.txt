Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the first operation of `other.ops` again, effectively duplicating it in the concatenated result instead of excluding it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first two operations of `other.ops`, potentially omitting important changes that should be included in the concatenated result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the operations in `other.ops`, which could lead to an incorrect application of operations when concatenating with `this.ops`.

DONE.
