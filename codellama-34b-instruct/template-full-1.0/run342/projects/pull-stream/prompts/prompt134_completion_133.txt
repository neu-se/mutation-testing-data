  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the function now returns a stream that does not end immediately, which may cause errors in the code that relies on this behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function now returns a stream that may produce a null value, which may cause errors in the code that relies on this behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the function now returns a stream that may produce an undefined value, which may cause errors in the code that relies on this behavior.

DONE.
