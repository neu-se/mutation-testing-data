  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === false ? null : abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the check for the `abort` variable, causing the `onAbort` function to be called when `abort` is `false` instead of `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === true && !onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the logical operator from `&&` to `||`, causing the `onAbort` function to be called only if `abort` is `true` and `onAbort` is not `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === false && !onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the check for the `abort` variable, causing the `onAbort` function to be called only if `abort` is `false` and `onAbort` is not `undefined`.

DONE.
