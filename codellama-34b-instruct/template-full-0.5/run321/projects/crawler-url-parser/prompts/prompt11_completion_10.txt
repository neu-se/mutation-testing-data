  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^https?:\/\//
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow for both "http" and "https" protocols, whereas the original code only allowed for "http".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^http:\/\/(?!localhost)/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow for "http" protocol only and would not allow for "localhost" as a domain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!https?:\/\/)/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow for any protocol other than "http" or "https".

DONE.
