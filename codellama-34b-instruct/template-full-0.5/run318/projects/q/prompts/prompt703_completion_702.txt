  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a valid JavaScript expression that evaluates to `undefined`, while `arguments` is an object that represents the arguments passed to a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that represents the absence of any object value, while `arguments` is an object that represents the arguments passed to a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` is a keyword that refers to the current execution context, while `arguments` is an object that represents the arguments passed to a function.

DONE.
