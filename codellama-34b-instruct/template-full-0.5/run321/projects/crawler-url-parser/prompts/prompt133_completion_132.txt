  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would escape the forward slash in the URL, causing the `parse` function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `parse` function to return a different value, as the `#` character is used to indicate the start of a fragment identifier in a URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'?'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `parse` function to return a different value, as the `?` character is used to indicate the start of a query string in a URL.

DONE.
