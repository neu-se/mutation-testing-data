  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb(err === true ? null : err, null)` checks if `err` is `true` and if so, passes `null` as the first argument to `cb`. However, the new code fragment `cb(null, null)` always passes `null` as both arguments to `cb`, regardless of the value of `err`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb(err === true ? null : err, null)` checks if `err` is `true` and if so, passes `null` as the first argument to `cb`.
