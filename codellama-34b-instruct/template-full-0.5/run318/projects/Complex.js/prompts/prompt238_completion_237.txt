  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative sign would cause the `sin` function to return the opposite value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b+1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+1` would cause the `sin` function to return a value that is offset by `1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.cos` function would return the cosine of `b`, which is not the same as the sine of `b`.

DONE.
