  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc + data
```
This change will cause the reducer function to return the sum of `acc` and `data`, rather than the concatenation of `acc` and `data`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc - data
```
This change will cause the reducer function to return the difference between `acc` and `data`, rather than the concatenation of `acc` and `data`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc * data
```
This change will cause the reducer function to return the product of `acc` and `data`, rather than the concatenation of `acc` and `data`.

DONE.
