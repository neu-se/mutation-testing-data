 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'./'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the dest path relative to the current file instead of using the basename from the URL as the filename.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the URL as the destination path instead of the original basename.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.join(path.dirname(options.url), decodedBasename)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the directory of the URL as the destination path instead of the current file's directory.

DONE.
