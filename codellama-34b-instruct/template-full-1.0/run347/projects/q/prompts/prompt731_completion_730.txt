  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ index: index + 1, value: progress - 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the generated object property `index` would be incremented by 1, and the `value` property would be decremented by 1, which could cause the notification to be out of sync with the actual progress of the promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ index: index * 2, value: progress / 2 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the generated object property `index` would be multiplied by 2, and the `value` property would be divided by 2, which could cause the notification to be incorrect if the progress of the promises is not divisible by 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ index: index + Math.floor(Math.random() * 10), value: progress + Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) }
```
This would result in
