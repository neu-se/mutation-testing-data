  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `arg` to be a number, but if it's replaced with a function that returns a string, the program will fail with a type error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is expecting a number, but if it's replaced with an expression that always returns a different number, the program's behavior will be affected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is expecting a number, but if it's replaced with an expression that always returns a different number, the program's behavior will be affected.

DONE.
