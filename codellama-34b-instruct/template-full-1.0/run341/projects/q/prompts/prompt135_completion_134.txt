  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_hasOwnProperty` is a function that checks if an object has the specified property as its own property, whereas `object_toString` is a function that returns a string representing the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString` is a function that returns a string representing the object, whereas `object_hasOwnProperty` is a function that checks if an object has the specified property as its own property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_create
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_create` is a function that creates a new object with the specified prototype, whereas `object_toString` is a function that returns a string representing the object.

DONE.
