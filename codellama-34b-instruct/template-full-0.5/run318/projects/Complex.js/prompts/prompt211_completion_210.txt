  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `b` variable before the `a` variable, while the replaced code fragment uses `a` before `b`. This could cause the resulting complex number to be different, depending on the values of `a` and `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `b` variable as-is, while the replaced code fragment takes the absolute value of `b` before using it. This could cause the resulting complex number to be different, depending on the value of `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `b` variable as-is, while the replaced code fragment multiplies `b` by `Math.PI` before using it. This could cause the resulting complex number to be different
