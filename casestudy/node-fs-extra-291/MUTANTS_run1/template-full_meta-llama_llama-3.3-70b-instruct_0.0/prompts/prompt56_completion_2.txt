Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
targetPath
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string would be the `targetPath` itself, rather than a modified version of it, potentially leading to incorrect file paths.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentPath
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string would be the `currentPath` instead of the `targetPath`, effectively copying files to their original location.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
targetPath.replace('$', '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string would remove all occurrences of '$' from the `targetPath`, potentially altering the intended file paths.

DONE.
