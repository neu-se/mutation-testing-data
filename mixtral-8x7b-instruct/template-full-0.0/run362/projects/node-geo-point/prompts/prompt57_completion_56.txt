 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0 as the bearing, regardless of the input coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a random number between 0 and 1 as the bearing, instead of calculating the correct bearing based on the input coordinates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the latitude of the current object as the longitude of the second point, which would result in incorrect bearing calculations.

DONE.
