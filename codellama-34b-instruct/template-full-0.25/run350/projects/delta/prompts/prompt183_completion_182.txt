  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.delete` is a different value than `otherOp.retain`, and would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` in cases where it would have evaluated to `true` with the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.delete` is a different value than `otherOp.retain`, and would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` in cases where it would have evaluated to `true` with the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `otherOp.retain`, and would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` in cases where it would have evaluated to `true` with the original code.

DONE.
