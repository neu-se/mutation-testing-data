  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(cb || function () {})()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only uses the `cb` argument if it is a function, while this new code fragment always calls the `cb` argument and passes it to an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return cb || function () {}; }(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only uses the `cb` argument if it is a function, while this new code fragment always calls the `cb` argument and passes it to a function that returns a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof cb === 'function' && cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only uses the `cb` argument if it is a function, while this new code fragment only calls the `cb` argument if it is a function.

DONE.
