  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `d` is equal to zero, while the new code checks if it is not equal to zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `d` is equal to zero, while the new code checks if it is greater than zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d <= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `d` is equal to zero, while the new code checks if it is less than or equal to zero.

DONE.
