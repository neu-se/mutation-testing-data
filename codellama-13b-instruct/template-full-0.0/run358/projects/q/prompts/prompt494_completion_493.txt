  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reason` variable would be undefined, which would cause the `reject` function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reason` variable would be null, which would cause the `reject` function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"test"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reason` variable would be a string, which would cause the `reject` function to throw an error.

DONE.
