  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resetUnhandledRejections()` function would be called twice, which would reset the `unhandledRejections` and `unhandledReasons` arrays to empty, potentially hiding unhandled rejections that occurred before the `resetUnhandledRejections()` function was called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only reset the `unhandledRejections` array to empty, but not the `unhandledReasons` array, which could lead to inconsistencies in the tracking of unhandled rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.length = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only reset the `unhandledReasons` array to empty, but not the `unhandledRejections`
