 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` condition would always evaluate to `false`, even if `baseUrlStr` is not `undefined` and does not contain illegal characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"baseUrlStr"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string literal `"baseUrlStr"` would be evaluated as a truthy value, causing the `if` condition to always evaluate to `true`. This would effectively disable the check for `baseUrlStr`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
baseUrlStr.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` check would always return `'string'`, even if `baseUrlStr` is `undefined`. This could potentially cause a `TypeError` if `baseUrlStr` is `undefined` and is passed to `URL.parse()`.

DONE.
