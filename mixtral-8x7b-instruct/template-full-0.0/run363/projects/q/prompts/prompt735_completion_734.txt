 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `all` function resolves the returned promise when all input promises are resolved, while `Promise.resolve()` resolves the returned promise immediately, regardless of the input promises' statuses.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject(new Error('Rejected'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `all` function resolves the returned promise when all input promises are resolved, while `Q.reject(new Error('Rejected'))` immediately rejects the returned promise, without considering the input promises' statuses.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { throw new Error('Forced Rejection') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `all` function resolves the returned promise when all input promises are resolved, while the provided function throws an error, which would cause the returned promise to be rejected.
