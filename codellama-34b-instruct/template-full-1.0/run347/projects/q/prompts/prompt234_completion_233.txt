  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise` is a local variable in the `promiseDispatch` function, and it would not have the same value as the `resolvedPromise` variable in the outer scope.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred` is a local variable in the `defer` function, and it would not have the same value as the `resolvedPromise` variable in the outer scope.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve()` creates a new resolved promise, whereas `resolvedPromise` is a variable that holds a promise that may or may not be resolved.

DONE.
