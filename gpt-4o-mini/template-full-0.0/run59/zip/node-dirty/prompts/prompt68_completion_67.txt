Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.path === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `this.path` is an empty string instead of checking if it is falsy, which would not account for other falsy values like `null` or `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.path != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `this.path` is not `null`, which would allow for an empty string or other falsy values to pass through, leading to the `_load` method being executed even when `this.path` is not a valid path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.path.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the length of `this.path` is greater than zero, which would allow for non-empty strings that are not valid paths to be treated as valid, potentially leading to unexpected behavior during file operations.

DONE.
