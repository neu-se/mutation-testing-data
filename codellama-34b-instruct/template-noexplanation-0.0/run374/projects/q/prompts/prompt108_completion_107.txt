  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This will cause the loop to never terminate, as the value of `i` will never reach the value of `this.length`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This will cause the loop to skip every other element in the array, potentially missing the desired value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = this.length - 1
```
This will cause the loop to start at the end of the array and work its way backwards, potentially finding the desired value but also potentially missing it.

DONE.
