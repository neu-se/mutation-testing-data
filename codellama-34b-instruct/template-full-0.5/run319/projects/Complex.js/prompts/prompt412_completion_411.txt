  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the code to pass through the `if` statement even if `b` is not equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the code to pass through the `if` statement even if `b` is equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the code to pass through the `if` statement even if `a` is not equal to 0.

DONE.
