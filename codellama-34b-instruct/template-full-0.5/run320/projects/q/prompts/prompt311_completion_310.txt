  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` function is used to create a new promise, while `null` would result in a null reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` function is used to create a new promise, while `undefined` would result in a type error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` function is used to create a new promise, while `0` would result in a rejected promise with the value `0`.

DONE.
