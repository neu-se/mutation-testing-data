  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `arguments` object, which is a special object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function. Replacing it with `null` would cause the function to throw an error if it relies on the arguments object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `arguments` object to access the first argument passed to the function. Replacing it with `0` would cause the function to return a value of `0` instead of the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `arguments` object to access the first argument passed to the function. Replacing it with `undefined` would cause the function to return `undefined` instead of the expected value.

DONE.
