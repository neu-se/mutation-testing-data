  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.includes(text)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `!` operator to check if `text` is not included in `tmpUrl.text`, while this replacement code fragment checks if `text` is included in `tmpUrl.text`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.indexOf(text) === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `includes` method to check if `text` is not included in `tmpUrl.text`, while this replacement code fragment uses the `indexOf` method to check if `text` is not included in `tmpUrl.text`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.match(text) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `includes` method to check if `text` is not included in `tmpUrl.text`, while this replacement code fragment
