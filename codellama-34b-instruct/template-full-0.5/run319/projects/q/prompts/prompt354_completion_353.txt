  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `reject` would cause it to be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` would cause the promise to be resolved, whereas `reject` would cause it to be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `reject` would cause it to be resolved.

DONE.
