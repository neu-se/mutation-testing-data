  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude + point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition operator would cause the longitude values to be combined, resulting in a different calculation for the bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude * point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operator would cause the longitude values to be multiplied together, resulting in a different calculation for the bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude - point1.longitude + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction operator would cause the longitude values to be subtracted, resulting in a different calculation for the bearing. The addition of 180 degrees would also cause the bearing to be shifted by 180 degrees, resulting in a different bearing value.

DONE.
