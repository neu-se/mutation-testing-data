  Here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(b, a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan2(b, a)` is a different function from `Math.atan2(a, b)`, and it would change the order of the arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(a + b, a - b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add `a` and `b` before taking the arctangent, which would change the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(a, b) + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add Ï€ to the result of `Math.atan2(a, b)`, which would change the angle by 180 degrees.

DONE.
