  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.split("/")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `href` variable is a string, and calling `split()` on it with a forward slash as the separator would return an array of strings, where the first element is the protocol or scheme of the URL. This would cause the `parse()` function to receive a different input than expected, potentially leading to incorrect parsing and classification of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.replace(/\//g, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `href` variable is a string, and calling `replace()` on it with a regular expression that matches forward slashes would remove all forward slashes from the string. This would cause the `parse()` function to receive a different input than expected, potentially leading to incorrect parsing and classification of the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.split("/")[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `href`
