  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `true` when the array is empty, but the new code fragment returns `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `true` when the array is empty, but the new code fragment returns `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `true` when the array is empty, but the new code fragment returns the length of the array.

DONE.
