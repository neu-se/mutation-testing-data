 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisOp.retain === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the exact value `undefined` instead of the falsy value `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
typeof thisOp.retain === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `thisOp.retain` is of type `undefined` instead of checking if it is `null` or `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
!thisOp.hasOwnProperty('retain')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `retain` property exists in the `thisOp` object, instead of checking the value of the property.

DONE.
