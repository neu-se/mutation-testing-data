  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var l
```
This would result in different behavior because `var l` declares a new variable `l`, whereas `var k` declares a new variable `k`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
k + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `k + 1` increments the value of `k` by 1, whereas `var k` declares a new variable `k` with an undefined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sources[k]
```
This would result in different behavior because `sources[k]` references the `k`th element of the `sources` array, whereas `var k` declares a new variable `k` with an undefined value.

DONE.
