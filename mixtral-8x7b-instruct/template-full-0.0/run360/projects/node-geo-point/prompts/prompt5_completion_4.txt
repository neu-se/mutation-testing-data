 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.isArray
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the input is an array instead of an object, which can cause incorrect handling of Point objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(input) => typeof input === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it doesn't check if the input is not null, allowing null values to pass and potentially causing issues in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(input) => typeof input === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the input is a function instead of an object, which can cause incorrect handling of Point objects and other inputs.

DONE.
