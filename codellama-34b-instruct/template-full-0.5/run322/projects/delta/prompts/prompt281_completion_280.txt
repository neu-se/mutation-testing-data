  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the iterator to always return a length that is one more than the actual length of the next operation, which could cause the `eachLine` method to iterate over the wrong number of lines.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the iterator to always return a length that is one less than the actual length of the next operation, which could cause the `eachLine` method to skip over the last line of the document.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the iterator to always return a length that is twice the actual length of the next operation, which could cause the `eachLine` method to iterate over the same line multiple
