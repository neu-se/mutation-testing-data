  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tanh(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tanh(a)` is the hyperbolic tangent of `a`, while `cosh(a)` is the hyperbolic cosine of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2*cosh(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `2*cosh(a)` is twice the hyperbolic cosine of `a`, while `cosh(a)` is the hyperbolic cosine of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh(2*a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cosh(2*a)` is the hyperbolic cosine of `2*a`, while `cosh(a)` is the hyperbolic cosine of `a`.

DONE.
