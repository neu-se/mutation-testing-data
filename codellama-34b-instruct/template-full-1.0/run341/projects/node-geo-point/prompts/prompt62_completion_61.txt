  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log(deg2rad(point1.latitude))
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log` is a different function than `cos` and would produce a different output for the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(point1.latitude) / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the divisor has been changed from 1 to 2, which would result in a different output for the same input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(deg2rad(point1.latitude)) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because a multiplication factor of 2 has been added to the output of `cos`, which would change the result of the surrounding code.

DONE.
