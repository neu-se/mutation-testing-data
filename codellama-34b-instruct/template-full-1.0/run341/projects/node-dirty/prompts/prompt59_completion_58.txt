  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.close(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always pass 0 as the argument to the close function, regardless of the actual size of the data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.close(this._data.size);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the actual size of the data as the argument to the close function, instead of 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.close();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the close function without any arguments, which may cause unexpected behavior or errors if the close function is not designed to handle this case.

DONE.
