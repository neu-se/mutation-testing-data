  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `at` would be incremented by 1, rather than decremented by 1, which would cause the wrong index to be removed from the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
- 2
```
This would result in different behavior because 2 would be subtracted from the index, rather than 1, which would cause the wrong index to be removed from the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at - 3
```
This would result in different behavior because 3 would be subtracted from the index, rather than 1, which would cause the wrong index to be removed from the array.

DONE.
