 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
output.destroy()
```
This would result in different behavior because it immediately destroys the output stream, preventing any further writing to the target file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
process.stdout
```
This would result in different behavior because it redirects the output to the console instead of the target file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
fs.createWriteStream('/dev/null')
```
This would result in different behavior because it redirects the output to the null device, discarding all written data.

DONE.
