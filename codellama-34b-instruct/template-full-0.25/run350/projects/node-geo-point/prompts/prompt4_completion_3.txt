  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('type') && point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `point` object is an object and has the properties `type` and `coordinates`, while the new code fragment checks if the `point` object has the properties `type` and `coordinates` and also checks if the `point` object has the `hasOwnProperty` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type === 'Point' && point.coordinates.length === 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `point` object is an object and has the properties `type` and `coordinates`, while the new code fragment checks if the `point` object has the properties `type` and `coordinates` and also checks if the `coordinates` property is an array with 2 elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
