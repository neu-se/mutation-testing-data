```
deferred.reject
```
This change will cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved, which will have a different behavior than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This change will cause the promise to be notified instead of resolved, which will have a different behavior than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.cancel
```
This change will cause the promise to be canceled instead of resolved, which will have a different behavior than the original code.

DONE.
