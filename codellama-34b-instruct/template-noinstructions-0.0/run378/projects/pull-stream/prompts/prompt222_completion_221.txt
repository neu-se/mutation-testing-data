  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, data
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`, and it would cause the `map` function to receive a different set of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not the same as `data`, and it would cause the `map` function to receive a different set of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, null
```
This would result in different behavior because `data` is not the same as `null`, and it would cause the `map` function to receive a different set of arguments.

DONE.
