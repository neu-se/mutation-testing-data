  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, cb]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cbs` variable, which was an array of callback functions, would be overwritten by a single callback function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, {}]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cbs` variable, which was an array of callback functions, would be overwritten by an empty object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cbs` variable, which was an array of callback functions, would be overwritten by a null value.

DONE.
