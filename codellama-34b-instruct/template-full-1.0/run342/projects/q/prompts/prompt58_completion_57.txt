  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof setTimeout === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` and `setImmediate` are different functions, and one may be defined while the other is not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process.nextTick === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.nextTick` is a Node.js specific function, and it may not be defined in other environments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof Promise === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise` is a built-in object in modern browsers, and it may not be defined in other environments.

DONE.
