 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => deferred.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps the `deferred.reject()` call in an arrow function, potentially changing the context in which it is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` is a function reference, and not calling the function. This would cause the promise to always resolve, rather than rejecting as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes `null` as an argument to the `deferred.reject` method. This could potentially cause the handling of the rejected promise to change, depending on how the error is being handled downstream.

DONE.
