  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const options2 = options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new constant `options2` with the same value as `options`, but it would not modify the original `options` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.throws = false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the `throws` property of the `options` object, which could affect the behavior of the `readFileSync` and `writeFileSync` methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options = {...options, throws: false}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new object with the same properties as `options`, but with the `throws` property set to `false`. This would modify the `options` object, which could affect the behavior of the `readFileSync` and `writeFileSync` methods.

DONE.
