  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^#/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any string that starts with a hash character, whereas the original code fragment `/#.*$/` matches any string that starts with a hash character and has any number of characters after it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^#\w+/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any string that starts with a hash character and is followed by one or more word characters, whereas the original code fragment `/#.*$/` matches any string that starts with a hash character and has any number of characters after it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^#\w+/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any string that starts with a hash character and is followed by one or more word characters, and would ignore case, whereas the original code fragment `/#.*$/` matches any string that starts with a hash character and has any number of characters after it
