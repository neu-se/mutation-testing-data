  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject()` method would not be called with any argument, which would cause the promise to be rejected without any value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject()` method would be called with `null` as its argument, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the value `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject()` method would be called with the string `"error"` as its argument, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the value `"error"`.

DONE.
