  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because Math.ceil rounds up the value to the nearest integer, whereas Math.floor rounds down.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because Math.round rounds the value to the nearest integer, whereas Math.floor rounds down.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.trunc
```
This would result in different behavior because Math.trunc truncates the value to the nearest integer, whereas Math.floor rounds down.

DONE.
