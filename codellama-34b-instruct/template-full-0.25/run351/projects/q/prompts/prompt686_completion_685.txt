  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would return the value `1` when evaluated. The new code fragment `1 + 1` would return the value `2` when evaluated, which is different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would return the value `1` when evaluated. The new code fragment `2` would return the value `2` when evaluated, which is different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would return the value `1` when evaluated. The new code fragment `3` would return the value `3` when evaluated, which is different behavior.

DONE.
