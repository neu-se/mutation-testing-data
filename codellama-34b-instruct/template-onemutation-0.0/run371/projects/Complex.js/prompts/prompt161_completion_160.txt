  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()) {
  return Complex['INFINITY'];
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both `this` and `z` being infinite, while the new code fragment only checks for `this` being infinite. This change would cause the function to return `Complex['INFINITY']` even if `z` is infinite, which is not the intended behavior. DONE.
