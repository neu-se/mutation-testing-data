  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `defer` would cause the promise to be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve(null)` would cause the promise to be resolved with a value of `null`, whereas `defer` would cause the promise to be resolved with the value of `deferred`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(deferred)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve(deferred)` would cause the promise to be resolved with a value of `deferred`, whereas `defer` would cause the promise to be resolved with the value of `deferred`.

DONE.
