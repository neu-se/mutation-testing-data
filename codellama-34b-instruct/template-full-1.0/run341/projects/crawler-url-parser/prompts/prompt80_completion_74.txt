  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).prop('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop` returns the property value of an element, whereas `attr` returns the value of an attribute. In this case, `href` is an attribute, so using `prop` would not give the same result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).data('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because `data` returns the value of a data attribute, whereas `attr` returns the value of an attribute. In this case, `href` is not a data attribute, so using `data` would not give the same result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).get(0).href
```
This would result in different behavior because `get(0)` returns the underlying DOM element, and `.href` is a property of a DOM element, whereas
