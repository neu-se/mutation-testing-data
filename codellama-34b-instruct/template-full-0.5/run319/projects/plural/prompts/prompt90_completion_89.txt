  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('chilli', 'chilli')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a new rule to the pluralization function, but this replacement code fragment defines a rule that does not change the output of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('chilli', 'chillis')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment defines a rule that adds an 's' to the end of the word 'chilli', but this replacement code fragment defines a rule that adds 's' to the end of the word 'chillis'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('chillis', 'chilli')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment defines a rule that adds an 's' to the end of the word 'chilli', but this replacement code fragment defines a rule that removes an 's' from the end of the word 'chillis'.
