  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sources[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was accessing the entire `sources` array, while this code fragment is only accessing the first element of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sources.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was accessing the entire `sources` array, while this code fragment is only accessing the length of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sources.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was accessing the entire `sources` array, while this code fragment is only accessing the first element of the array, and then slicing it to a length of 1.

DONE.
