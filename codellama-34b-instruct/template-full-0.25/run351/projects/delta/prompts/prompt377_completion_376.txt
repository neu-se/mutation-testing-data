  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength` returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, while `peekType` returns the type of the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekOp
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekOp` returns the next operation in the iterator, while `peekType` returns the type of the next operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength` returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, while `peekType` returns the type of the next operation.

DONE.
