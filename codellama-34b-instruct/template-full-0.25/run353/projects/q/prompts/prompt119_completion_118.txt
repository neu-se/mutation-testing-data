  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty.call(Object.prototype, prop)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` for any property, even if it's not present in the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop in Object.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` for any property, even if it's not present in the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(Object.prototype, prop)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` for any property, even if it's not present in the object.

DONE.
