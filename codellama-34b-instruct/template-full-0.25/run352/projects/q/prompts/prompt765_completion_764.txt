  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(null, noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called on the `promise` object, but the `noop` function would be called instead of the `onRejected` function in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(noop, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called on the `promise` object, but the `noop` function would be called instead of the `onFulfilled` function in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(noop, noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called on the `promise` object, but both the `onFulfilled` and `onRejected` functions would be called with `noop`, which would cause the promise to be
