  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value is being used as a signal to indicate the end of the stream, and replacing it with `undefined` would cause the stream to continue indefinitely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value is being used as a signal to indicate the end of the stream, and replacing it with `false` would cause the stream to continue indefinitely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value is being used as a signal to indicate the end of the stream, and replacing it with `true` would cause the stream to continue indefinitely.

DONE.
