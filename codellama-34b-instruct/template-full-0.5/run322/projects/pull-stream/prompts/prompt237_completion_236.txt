  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator inverts the truthiness of the `cb` variable, causing the `return` statement to always be executed, regardless of the value of `end` or `test(data)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is being called with the wrong arguments. The original code fragment passes `end` and `data` as separate arguments, but this code fragment passes them as a single argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(data, end)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is being called with the arguments in the opposite order. The original code fragment passes `end` as the first argument and `data` as the second argument, but this code fragment passes `data` as the first argument and `end` as the second argument.

DONE.
