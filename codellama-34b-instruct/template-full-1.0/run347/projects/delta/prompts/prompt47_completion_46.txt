  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isEqual(a, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `isEqual` checks for value equality, while the original code uses `===` which checks for both value and reference equality. This could potentially lead to different results in the `transform` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
types.isEqual(a, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `types.isEqual` checks for value equality, while the original code uses `===` which checks for both value and reference equality. This could potentially lead to different results in the `transform` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isEqual(a, b, { recursive: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would perform a recursive equality check using the `isEqual` function, which could potentially lead to different results in the `transform` method.

DONE.
