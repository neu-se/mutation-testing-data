  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.map
```
This would result in different behavior because `map` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array, whereas `forEach` simply executes a provided function once per element in the calling array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` returns a new array with the elements that pass a test implemented by the provided function, whereas `forEach` simply executes a provided function once per element in the calling array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.reduce
```
This would result in different behavior because `reduce` returns a single value calculated by reducing the elements of the calling array, whereas `forEach` simply executes a provided function once per element in the calling array.

DONE.
