  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(result)
```
This would result in different behavior because `continuer.bind(result)` would create a function that takes two arguments, whereas the original code fragment `continuer.bind(continuer, "throw")` takes three arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(null, result)
```
This would result in different behavior because `continuer.bind(null, result)` would create a function that takes only one argument, whereas the original code fragment `continuer.bind(continuer, "throw")` takes three arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(null, result, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `continuer.bind(null, result, null)` would create a function that takes only two arguments, whereas the original code fragment `continuer.bind(continuer, "throw")` takes three arguments.
