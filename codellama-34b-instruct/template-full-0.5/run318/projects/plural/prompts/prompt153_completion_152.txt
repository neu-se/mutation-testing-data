  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.length` would return the length of the string, rather than the string itself, which is what the original code fragment does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `num + 1` would add 1 to the number, rather than returning the number itself, which is what the original code fragment does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.substring(1)` would return the substring starting from the second character of the string, rather than the string itself, which is what the original code fragment does.

DONE.
