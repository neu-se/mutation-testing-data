  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiverOptions || { format: 'zip' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `format` option to `'zip'` if `archiverOptions` is falsy, whereas the original code would use the `format` option provided in `archiverOptions` if it exists, or default to `'zip'` if it doesn't.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiverOptions && { format: 'zip' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `format` option to `'zip'` if `archiverOptions` is truthy, whereas the original code would use the `format` option provided in `archiverOptions` if it exists, or default to `'zip'` if it doesn't.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ format: 'zip' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the `format` option to `'zip'`, regardless of the value of
