 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `task` function would receive `null` as an argument instead of the expected value, causing potential errors or unexpected behavior in the `task` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return true; }
