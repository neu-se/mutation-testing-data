  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push(`/${part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$1')}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a regular expression to escape any special characters in the `part` string, while the replaced code fragment does not. This could cause the generated regular expression to be incorrect and not match the expected input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push(`/${part.replace(/[.*]/g, '\\$1')}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a regular expression to escape any special characters in the `part` string, while the replaced code fragment uses a different regular expression to escape any special characters. This could cause the generated regular expression to be incorrect and not match the expected input.
