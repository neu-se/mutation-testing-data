  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because `linkurl_pathname` refers to the entire path part of the link URL, including the final slash, whereas `linkurl_path` only refers to the path part without the final slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.substring(0, linkurl_path.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring()` returns a new string object with a specified substring, whereas `linkurl_path` is a string literal and cannot be mutated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a new string object with a specified substring, whereas `linkurl_path` is a string literal and cannot be mutated.

DONE.
