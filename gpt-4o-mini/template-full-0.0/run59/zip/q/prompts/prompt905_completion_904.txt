Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it only passes the first argument of `nodeArgs` to the `fapply` method instead of all arguments, potentially causing the function to not receive the necessary parameters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.concat([null])
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends a `null` value to the `nodeArgs` array, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the callback function that expects a valid argument instead of `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces `nodeArgs` with an empty array, meaning that no arguments would be passed to the function, likely causing it to fail or behave incorrectly.

DONE.
