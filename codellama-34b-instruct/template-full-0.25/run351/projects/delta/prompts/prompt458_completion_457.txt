  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset = 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code sets `this.offset` to 0, but this replacement sets it to 1. This could cause the `peekLength()` method to return a different value, potentially causing the `hasNext()` method to return a different value as well.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index = this.ops.length;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code sets `this.index` to 0, but this replacement sets it to the length of the `ops` array. This could cause the `peek()` method to return a different value, potentially causing the `peekLength()` method to return a different value as well.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset = -1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code sets `this.offset` to 0, but this replacement sets it to -1. This
