 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.pow(2, places || 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the base of the exponentiation is changed from 10 to 2, which significantly alters the function's behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
places !== undefined ? Math.pow(10, places) : 1
```
This would result in different behavior because if `places` is undefined, it will no longer default to 10, but instead become 1, which could cause unexpected results in the rounding function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
places || Math.pow(10, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because if `places` is 0 or negative, it will default to 10 (equivalent to `places = 1`), which would change the precision of the rounding function.

In all these cases, the mutated
