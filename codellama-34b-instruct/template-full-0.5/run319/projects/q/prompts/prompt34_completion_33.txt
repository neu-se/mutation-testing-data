  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `task` variable is used later in the code, and if it is set to `null`, it will cause errors when it is used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `task` variable is used later in the code, and if it is set to `undefined`, it will cause errors when it is used.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `task` variable is used later in the code, and if it is set to `0`, it will cause errors when it is used.

DONE.
