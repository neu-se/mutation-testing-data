  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function is called with the `cb` argument in a different position than in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is called with the `abort` argument in a different position than in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort(cb, abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` function is called with the `cb` argument in a different position than in the original code.

DONE.
