  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr, false, false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not normalize the URL's protocol and domain name, which are important in determining the URL's validity and type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace("http://", "https://")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the URL's protocol with "https", which could result in a different domain name being parsed (e.g. "https://example.com" instead of "http://example.com").

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace("www.", "")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the "www." subdomain from the URL, which could result in a different domain name being parsed (e.g. "example.com" instead of "www.example.com").

DONE.
