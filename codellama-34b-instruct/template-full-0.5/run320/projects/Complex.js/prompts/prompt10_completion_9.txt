  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `x` directly, while this code fragment uses the value of `x + 1`. This could potentially cause the function to return a different result, depending on the value of `x`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `x` directly, while this code fragment uses the value of `x - 1`. This could potentially cause the function to return a different result, depending on the value of `x`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `x` directly, while this code fragment uses the value of `2 * x`. This could potentially cause the function to return a different result, depending on the value of `x`.

DONE.
