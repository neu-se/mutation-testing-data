Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `.indexOf` returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified value in the string, while `.replace` returns a string with all occurrences of the specified value replaced.

```
currentUrlStr.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `.slice` returns a shallow copy of a portion of the string, while `.replace` returns a string with all occurrences of the specified value replaced. This could cause the `parse` function to fail if it is expecting a specific
