  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep)\b/i, function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only returns the word unchanged, while this new code fragment adds an 's' to the end of the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep)\b/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the word unchanged, while this new code fragment removes the last character of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep)\b/
