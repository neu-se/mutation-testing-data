 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPromiseAlike` function checks if the value is not null or undefined. By replacing it with null, the `coerce` function will be called, which might have different behavior depending on the implementation of `coerce`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `coerce` function will not be called, and the returned promise will be immediately resolved with a new promise instead of the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Function()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPromiseAlike` function checks if the value is not a function. By replacing it with a new function, the `coerce` function will be called, which might have different behavior depending on the implementation of `coerce`.

DONE.
