Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets `baseUrlStr` to `null`, which would cause the subsequent URL parsing logic to fail when trying to resolve relative URLs, potentially leading to incorrect or missing URL resolutions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr = currentUrlStr;
```
This would result in different behavior because it assigns `currentUrlStr` to `baseUrlStr`, which would incorrectly treat the current URL as the base URL, leading to incorrect resolution of relative URLs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr = "http://example.com";
```
This would result in different behavior because it hardcodes `baseUrlStr` to a specific URL, which would ignore the actual base URL provided and could lead to incorrect parsing and resolution of URLs based on a fixed base.

DONE.
