  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `diff` function would be called with the `NULL_CHARACTER` constant, which is a non-empty string, instead of the expected empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `diff` function would be called with a negative number, which would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `diff` function would be called with `NaN`, which is not a valid input for the function.

DONE.
