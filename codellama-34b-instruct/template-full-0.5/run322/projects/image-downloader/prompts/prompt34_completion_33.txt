  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.resume(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `res.resume()`, which would consume the response data to free up memory. Replacing it with `res.resume(null)` would cause the response data to be discarded, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the application.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.resume(res.body);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `res.resume()`, which would consume the response data to free up memory. Replacing it with `res.resume(res.body)` would cause the response data to be consumed twice, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the application.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.resume(Buffer.from(res.body));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `res.resume()`, which would consume the response data to free
