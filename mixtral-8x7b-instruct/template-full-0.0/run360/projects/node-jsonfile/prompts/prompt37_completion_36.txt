 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
['file', 'str', options]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `writeFile` method would receive an array instead of separate arguments, causing an error in the `fs.writeFile`/`fs.writeFileSync` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
file, str, _fs
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options` object would be replaced with the `_fs` object, causing unexpected behavior in the `fs.writeFile`/`fs.writeFileSync` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
file, str, { writeFile: fs.writeFile }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options` object would be replaced with an object containing the `writeFile` method from the `fs` object, causing the `universalify.fromCallback` method to fail since it expects a function reference.

DONE.
