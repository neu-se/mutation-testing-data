  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if(end === false)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return false if the `end` parameter is falsy (e.g., false, null, 0, etc.), which would cause the function to exit early without completing its job.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if(end.language === 'javascript')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `end` parameter is an object with a property named `language` that is 'javascript'. If it is, then the function would exit early without completing its job.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if(end.indexOf('end') === -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `end` parameter is a string that does not contain the word 'end'. If it doesn't, then the function would exit early without completing its job.
DONE.
