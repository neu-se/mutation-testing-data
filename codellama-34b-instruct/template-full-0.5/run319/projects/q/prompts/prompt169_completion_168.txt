  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isExternalFrame
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInternalFrame` checks if the frame is part of the Q library, while `isExternalFrame` checks if the frame is part of an external library.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isInternalFrame
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInternalFrame` checks if the frame is part of the Q library, while `!isInternalFrame` checks if the frame is not part of the Q library.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNodeFrame
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInternalFrame` checks if the frame is part of the Q library, while `isNodeFrame` checks if the frame is part of the Node.js runtime.

DONE.
