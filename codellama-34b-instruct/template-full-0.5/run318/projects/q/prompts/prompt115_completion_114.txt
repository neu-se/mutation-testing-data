  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value, and `value` is a variable that may hold any value, including `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, and `value` is a variable that may hold any value, including `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `value + 1` is a different calculation than `value`, and may produce a different result.

DONE.
