  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.split('/')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first part of the URL, which could be a different domain or subdomain, and would not take into account the rest of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.split('/')[0].replace(/\./g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove all periods from the first part of the URL, which could result in a different domain or subdomain being considered.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.split('/')[0].replace(/\./g, '').toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove all periods and convert the first part of the URL to lowercase, which could result in a different domain or subdomain being considered.

DONE.
