  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is now 'foo' instead of 'error', so the event listener would not be triggered.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is now 'error' twice, so the event listener would be triggered twice.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is now null, so the event listener would not be triggered.

DONE.
