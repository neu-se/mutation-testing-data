  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of an array. In this context, `unshift` would cause the `nextOp` to be added to the beginning of the `ops` array, rather than the end.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes the last element of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of an array. In this context, `pop` would cause the last `op` to be removed from the `ops` array, rather than adding a new element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.splice(0, 0, nextOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` adds an element to a specific position in an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the
