  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would select the `href` attribute of the `base` element, rather than the `href` attribute of the `a` element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('a').attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would select the `href` attribute of all `a` elements, rather than just the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('a:first').attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would select the `href` attribute of the first `a` element, rather than the `href` attribute of all `a` elements.

DONE.
