  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['..."arg"] 
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses string concatenation and would fail with a null pointer exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.arg 
```
This would result in different behavior because it is accessing the "arg" property of the a object directly, rather than the ellipsis (...) indicating a variable length argument list.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a != null) ? a.arg : 0 
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for null before accessing the "arg" property, which would avoid a null pointer exception.

DONE.
