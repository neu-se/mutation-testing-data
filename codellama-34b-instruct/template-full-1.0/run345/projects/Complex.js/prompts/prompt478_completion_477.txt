  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the check, so a finite number would be considered infinite and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite(this['re']) && isFinite(this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if both the real and imaginary parts are finite, whereas the original code only checks the real part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite(this['re'] * this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the product of the real and imaginary parts is finite, whereas the original code only checks the real part.

DONE.
