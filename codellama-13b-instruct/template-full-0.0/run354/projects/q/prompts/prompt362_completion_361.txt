  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the rejected callback would be called instead of the fulfilled callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the fulfilled callback would be called instead of the rejected callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_progressed(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the progressed callback would be called instead of the fulfilled or rejected callbacks.

DONE.
