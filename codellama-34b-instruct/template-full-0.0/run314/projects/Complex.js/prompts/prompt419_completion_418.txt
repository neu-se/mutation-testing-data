  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero'](0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the complex number is zero, while the new code fragment always returns true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the complex number is infinite, while the new code fragment always returns false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the complex number is not a number, while the new code fragment always returns false.

DONE.
