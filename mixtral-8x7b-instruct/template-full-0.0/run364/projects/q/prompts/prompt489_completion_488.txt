 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resetUnhandledRejections` function would always execute its first statement, setting `trackUnhandledRejections` to `true`, even if it was passed a different argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'trackUnhandledRejections'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resetUnhandledRejections` function would always attempt to set the `trackUnhandledRejections` property on the global object, even if it was passed a different argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { return undefined; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resetUnhandledRejections` function would always return `undefined`, regardless of the argument it was passed. This could potentially cause issues if other parts of the codebase rely on the correct value being returned from this function.

DONE.
