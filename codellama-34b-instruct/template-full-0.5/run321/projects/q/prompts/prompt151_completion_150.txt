  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift()` adds an element to the beginning of an array, while `pop()` removes an element from the end of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift()` adds an element to the beginning of an array, while `shift()` removes an element from the beginning of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.push()
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift()` adds an element to the beginning of an array, while `push()` adds an element to the end of an array.

DONE.
