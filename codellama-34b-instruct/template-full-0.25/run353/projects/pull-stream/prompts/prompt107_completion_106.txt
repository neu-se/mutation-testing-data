  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, done
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`, and it would cause the `drain` function to receive a different argument than it was designed to handle.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not the same as `done`, and it would cause the `drain` function to receive a different argument than it was designed to handle.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done, done

This would result in different behavior because `done` is not the same as `null`, and it would cause the `drain` function to receive a different argument than it was designed to handle.

DONE.
