Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly pluralize uncountable nouns by appending 's', which is not the intended behavior for words like "water" or "sugar".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.length }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the word instead of the word itself, which would not provide a valid plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.toUpperCase() }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the word to uppercase instead of returning the original word, which is not the expected outcome for pluralization.

DONE.
