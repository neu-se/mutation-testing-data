  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as the first argument to `rejected`, which could cause the function to behave differently if it expects a specific value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be passed as the first argument to `rejected`, which could cause the function to behave differently if it expects a specific value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `true` value would be passed as the first argument to `rejected`, which could cause the function to behave differently if it expects a specific value.

DONE.
