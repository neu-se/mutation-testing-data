  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/g, function(w) { return w.replace(/ics$/, "ices") }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only replaces the "ics" suffix with "ices" if it is at the end of the word, while this new code fragment replaces all occurrences of "ics" with "ices".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/ics$/, "ices") }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only replaces the "ics" suffix with "ices" if it is at the end of the word, while this new code fragment replaces all occurrences of "ics" with "ices" regardless of its position in the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

/ics$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/ics$/, "ices") }
```
