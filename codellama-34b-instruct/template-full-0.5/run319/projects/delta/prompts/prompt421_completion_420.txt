  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property would be incremented by 1, which could cause the code to access the wrong index in the `ops` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property would be decremented by 1, which could cause the code to skip over the last operation in the `ops` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property would be multiplied by 2, which could cause the code to access the wrong index in the `ops` array or to skip over some operations.

DONE.
