Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because setting `Î´` to `0` would cause the destination calculation to always return the original coordinate, regardless of the distance and bearing provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance
```
This would result in different behavior because using `distance` instead of the calculated angular distance would lead to incorrect calculations, as it would not convert the distance in meters to radians properly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because using `Math.PI / 2` would imply a fixed angular distance of 90 degrees, which would not accurately reflect the intended distance based on the input, leading to incorrect destination coordinates.

DONE.
