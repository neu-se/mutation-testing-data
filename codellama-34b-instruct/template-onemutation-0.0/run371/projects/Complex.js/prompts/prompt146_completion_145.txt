  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](a, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the complex number `z` was zero, but the new code fragment is checking if the complex number `z` is zero with the real part `a` and imaginary part `b`. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `z` is zero, which could lead to incorrect results.

DONE.
