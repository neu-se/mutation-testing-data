  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = true;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deprecated` property would always be set to `true`, even if it was not intended to be set.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = !options.deprecated;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deprecated` property would be inverted, even if it was not intended to be inverted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = options.deprecated ? false : true;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deprecated` property would be set to `false` if it was not already set to `true`, and vice versa.

DONE.
