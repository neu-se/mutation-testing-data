  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the value of `a` by adding 1, which could potentially alter the calculations made later in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a
```
This would result in different behavior because it doubles the value of `a`, which could also potentially alter the calculations made later in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it decreases the value of `a` by 1, which could potentially alter the calculations made later in the code.

DONE.
