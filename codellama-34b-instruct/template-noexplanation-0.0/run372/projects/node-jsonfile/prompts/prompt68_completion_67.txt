  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\uFEFF/g, ''
```
This code fragment uses the `g` flag to replace all occurrences of the Unicode byte order mark (BOM) at the beginning of the string, rather than just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\uFEFF/i, ''
```
This code fragment uses the `i` flag to make the regular expression case-insensitive, so it will match the BOM regardless of whether it is uppercase or lowercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\uFEFF/gm, ''
```
This code fragment uses the `g` flag to replace all occurrences of the BOM, and the `m` flag to make the regular expression match across multiple lines.

DONE.
