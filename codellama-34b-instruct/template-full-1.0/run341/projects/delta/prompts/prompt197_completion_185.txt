  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp['retain']
```
This would result in different behavior because passing an object as the first argument to `newOp` would cause the function to return an object, which would be incompatible with the expected return type of the function, which is an op.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp['insert'] = thisOp.insert;
newOp['retain'] = true;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the intended type of the object being passed to the function, which would cause the function to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return an empty object, which would be incompatible with the expected return type of the function, which is an op.

DONE.
