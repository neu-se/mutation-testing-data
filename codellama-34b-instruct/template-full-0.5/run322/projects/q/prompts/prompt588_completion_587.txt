  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.spawn(function* () {
    var foo = yield getFooPromise();
    var bar = yield getBarPromise();
    return foo + bar;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `yield` keyword is used to wait for the promises to resolve, but the `Q.spawn` function does not support yielding promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.spawn(function* () {
    var foo = yield getFooPromise();
    var bar = yield getBarPromise();
    return foo - bar;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `return` statement is used to return the result of subtracting `bar` from `foo`, but the `Q.spawn` function does not support returning values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.spawn(function* () {
    var foo = yield getFooPromise();
    var
