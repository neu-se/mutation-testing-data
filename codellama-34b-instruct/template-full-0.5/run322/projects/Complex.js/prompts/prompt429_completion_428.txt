  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places || 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `places` variable is not used as an exponent in the original code, but using `places || 1` would cause the `places` variable to be used as an exponent, which would change the result of the `Math.pow()` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10, places
```
This would result in different behavior because the `places` variable is not used in the original code, but using `10, places` would cause the `places` variable to be used as an exponent, which would change the result of the `Math.pow()` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places * 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the `places` variable is not used in the original code, but using `places * 10` would cause the `places` variable to be used as an exponent, which
