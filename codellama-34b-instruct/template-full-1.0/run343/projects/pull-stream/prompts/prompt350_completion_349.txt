  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER> = prop
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop` is an object, and using `=` to assign `prop` to a function would return a reference to the function, not the function itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER> = prop.test
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.test` is a function, and using `=` to assign `prop.test` to a function would return a reference to the function, not the function itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER> = prop.test()
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.test()` is a string, and using `=` to assign `prop.test()` to a function would result in a type mismatch.

DONE.
