  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, data
```
This change will cause the function to return `undefined` instead of `null` when the test fails. This may cause issues with the function's behavior, as it may not be able to handle `undefined` values correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null
```
This change will cause the function to return `null` instead of `null` when the test fails. This may cause issues with the function's behavior, as it may not be able to handle `null` values correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, data
```
This change will cause the function to return the same value for both the `null` and `undefined` cases. This may cause issues with the function's behavior, as it may not be able to handle these values correctly.

DONE.
