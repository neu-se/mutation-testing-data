  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.d + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `tz.d` property to determine the DST offset, but adding 1 to it would change the value and potentially result in a different DST offset.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.d * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `tz.d` property to determine the DST offset, but multiplying it by 2 would change the value and potentially result in a different DST offset.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.d - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `tz.d` property to determine the DST offset, but subtracting 1 from it would change the value and potentially result in a different DST offset.

DONE.
