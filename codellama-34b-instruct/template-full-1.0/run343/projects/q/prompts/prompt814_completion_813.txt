  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `fcall` is a method of the `Q` object, while `call` is a method of the `Function` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {
    return callback();
}
```
This would result in different behavior because `fcall` is a method that takes the context object as an argument, while the replacement code does not have the context object as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);
args.unshift(null);
callback.apply(null, arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because `fcall` is a method that takes the context object as an argument, while the replacement code does not have the context object as an argument.

DONE.
