 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp` returns the natural exponentiation of a number, while `cosh` calculates the hyperbolic cosine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / Math.sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the reciprocal of the hyperbolic sine, which is not the same as the hyperbolic cosine.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cos(b) * Math.cos(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the product of the cosines of `a` and `b`, instead of the hyperbolic cosine of `b` and the cosine of `a`.

DONE.
