  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is an object and `a['arg']` is a property of that object, while `a` on its own would be a reference to the object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` is a variable that has not been defined, while `a['arg']` is a property of an object that has been defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.arg
```
This would result in different behavior because `a.arg` is a property of an object that has been defined, while `a['arg']` is a property of the same object that has been defined.

DONE.
