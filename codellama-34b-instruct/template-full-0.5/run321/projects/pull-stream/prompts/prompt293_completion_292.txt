  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'string' === typeof test
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `test` is a number, while this code checks if it is a string. This would cause the function to behave differently for inputs that are not numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test === NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `test` is a number, while this code checks if it is NaN (Not a Number). This would cause the function to behave differently for inputs that are not numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `test` is a number, while this code checks if it is Infinity. This would cause the function to behave differently for inputs that are not numbers.

DONE.
