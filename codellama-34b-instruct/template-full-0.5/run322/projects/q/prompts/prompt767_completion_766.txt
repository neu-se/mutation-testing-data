  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(err);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` will always reject the promise with the given error, regardless of whether the promise was fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.resolve(err);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve()` will always fulfill the promise with the given value, regardless of whether the promise was rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.defer().resolve(err);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new deferred object and resolve it with the given error, which would result in a different behavior than the original code.

DONE.
