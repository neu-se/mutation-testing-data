  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` and `Math.cos` have different outputs for the same input, which would cause the `exp` function to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because `1` is not a function and would cause a runtime error when the `exp` function tries to call it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a constant that represents the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, and it would cause the `exp` function to return incorrect results.

DONE.
