Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\/$/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly allow paths that end with a slash, as it only checks for a trailing slash instead of ensuring that the path does not end with a slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.includes('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow any path that contains at least one slash, regardless of whether it ends with a slash or has empty segments, thus bypassing the original validation logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^[^/]+$/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly validate paths that consist of a single segment without slashes, which is not the intended behavior of the original code that requires paths to start with a slash.

DONE.
