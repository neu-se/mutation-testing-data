  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always execute the block under the if statement, even if `other.ops.length` is 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would never execute the block under the if statement, even if `other.ops.length` is greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would only execute the block under the if statement if `other.ops.length` is greater than 1.

DONE.
