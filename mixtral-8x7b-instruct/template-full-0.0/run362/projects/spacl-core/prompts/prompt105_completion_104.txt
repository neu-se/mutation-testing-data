 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'some-static-name'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the result of `policy.matches('some-static-name', path, ctx)`, which may not match the intended policy based on the provided `name`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would generate a random number, making the result unpredictable and unrelated to the provided `name`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the current `PolicyMap` object as the policy, which is not the intended behavior since the policy should be based on the provided `name`.

DONE.
