  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a mathematical constant representing the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, while `baseUrlStr` is a string variable containing a URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"A string literal"
```
This would result in different behavior because a string literal is a fixed string value, while `baseUrlStr` is a variable that can hold a different string value each time the function is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof(baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof(baseUrlStr)` is the type of `baseUrlStr`, which is a string, while `baseUrlStr` is a variable that can hold a different string value each time the function is called.

DONE.
