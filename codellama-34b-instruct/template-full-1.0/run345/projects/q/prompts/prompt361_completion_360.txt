  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would result in the promise being rejected, while `deferred.resolve` would result in the promise being resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve` would result in a new resolved promise, while `deferred.resolve` would resolve an existing promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.thenResolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.thenResolve` is a method that returns a new promise that is resolved with the given value, while `deferred.resolve` is a method that resolves an existing promise with the given value.

DONE.
