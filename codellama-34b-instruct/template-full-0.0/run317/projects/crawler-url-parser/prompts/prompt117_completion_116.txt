  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
gettype(linkurl, pageurl)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gettype` function is not defined in the provided code snippet, so the code would throw a `ReferenceError` when attempting to call it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.gettype(pageurl)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gettype` function is not defined as a method of the `linkurl` object, so the code would throw a `TypeError` when attempting to call it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.gettype(linkurl)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gettype` function is not defined as a method of the `pageurl` object, so the code would throw a `TypeError` when attempting to call it.

DONE.
