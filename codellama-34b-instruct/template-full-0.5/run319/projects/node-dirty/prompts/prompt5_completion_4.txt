  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + '_bug'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a suffix to the key, which would cause the data to be stored under a different key in the database.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the key, which would cause the data to be stored under a different key in the database.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the key to uppercase, which would cause the data to be stored under a different key in the database.

DONE.
