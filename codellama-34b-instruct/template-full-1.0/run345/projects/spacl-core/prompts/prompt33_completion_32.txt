  Sure, I can help you with that. Here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part = spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse()[0];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the array before getting the first element, so the resulting regular expression would be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part = spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse()[1];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would get the second-to-last element of the reversed array, so the resulting regular expression would be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part = spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would get the last element of the reversed array, so the resulting regular expression would be different.

DONE.
