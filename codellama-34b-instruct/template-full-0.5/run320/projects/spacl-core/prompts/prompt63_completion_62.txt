  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, but it does not change the order of the properties in the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.sort()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sort()` method sorts the elements in the array, but it does not change the order of the properties in the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method returns a new array with the specified elements, but it does not change the order of the properties in the object.

DONE.
