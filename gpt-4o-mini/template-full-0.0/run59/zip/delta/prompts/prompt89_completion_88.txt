Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow non-object values (like strings or numbers) to pass the check, potentially leading to unexpected behavior when trying to assign `newOp.attributes` to `this.ops[index - 1].attributes`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.attributes === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only allow attributes that are functions to pass the check, which is likely not the intended use case, causing valid attribute objects to be ignored.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(newOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only accept attributes that are arrays, rejecting valid object attributes, which could lead to loss of important data when pushing operations.

DONE.
