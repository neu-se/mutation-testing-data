Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately resolve the promise with an undefined value, ignoring the actual promises in the array and potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` instead of the actual promise, causing the `when` function to treat it as a non-promise value, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises[index] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to add 1 to the promise object, which is not a valid operation, leading to a type error and causing the promise chain to fail.

DONE.
