  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return `undefined` instead of a `Policy` object, which would cause the `matches` method to always return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return `null` instead of a `Policy` object, which would cause the `matches` method to always return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return an empty string instead of a `Policy` object, which would cause the `matches` method to always return `false`.

DONE.
