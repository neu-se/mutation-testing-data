  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>(resolvedPromise.promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the resolved promise instead of the nearer value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>(reject(reason))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with the given reason instead of resolving it with the nearer value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>(fulfill(value))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would fulfill the promise with the given value instead of resolving it with the nearer value.

DONE.
