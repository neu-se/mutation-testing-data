  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `word.length` is a different value than `type`, which is a function that returns the type of a variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `word.toUpperCase()` is a different value than `type`, which is a function that returns the type of a variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `word.split('')` is a different value than `type`, which is a function that returns the type of a variable.

DONE.
