  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because `point1Rad` is the latitude of the first point, while `point2Rad` is the latitude of the second point. Using `point1Rad` instead of `point2Rad` would cause the calculation to use the latitude of the first point instead of the second point, which would result in an incorrect calculation of the distance between the two points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `point2Rad * 2` would double the latitude of the second point, which would cause the calculation to use a different value for the latitude of the second point. This would result in an incorrect calculation of the distance between the two points.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1Rad + point2Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because `point1Rad + point2Rad` would add the latitude of the first point to the latitude of the
