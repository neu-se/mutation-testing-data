  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object 
```
This would result in different behavior because it is a different object, and the `Object.keys()` method returns a different array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return object; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it is a different function, and the `values()` method would be called with a different argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it is a different value, and the `Object.keys()` method would throw an error when called with `null`.

DONE.
