  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
- - op
```
This would result in different behavior because the operator has changed from unary negation to decrement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
~ op
```
This would result in different behavior because the operator has changed from unary negation to bitwise NOT.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value being passed to the `when` function is now one greater than the original value.

DONE.
