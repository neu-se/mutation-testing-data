  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"QReturnValue(value)"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would utilize the `QReturnValue` constructor, which is not used in the original code and could potentially cause errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"obj[prop] = descriptor"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the object property to the descriptor, which is not the intended behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"QReturnValue({ ...descriptor, value })Â 
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new object with the descriptor properties and the `value` property, which is not the intended behavior of the code.

DONE.
