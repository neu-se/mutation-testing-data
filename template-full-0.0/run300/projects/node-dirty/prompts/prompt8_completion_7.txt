  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `val` would return the value of the `val` variable, while the new code fragment `null` would return the value `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `val` would return the value of the `val` variable, while the new code fragment `undefined` would return the value `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `val` would return the value of the `val` variable, while the new code fragment `0` would return the value `0`.

DONE.
