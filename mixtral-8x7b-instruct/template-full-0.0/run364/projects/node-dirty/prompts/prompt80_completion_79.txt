 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Error('File not found')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would always be 'File not found', even if the error is caused by something other than a file not being found.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
err || new Error('File not found')
```
This would result in different behavior because if `err` is falsy (e.g. `null` or `undefined`), the error message would be 'File not found', even if the error is caused by something other than a file not being found.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Error('An error occurred')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would always be 'An error occurred', providing less information about the actual error.

DONE.
