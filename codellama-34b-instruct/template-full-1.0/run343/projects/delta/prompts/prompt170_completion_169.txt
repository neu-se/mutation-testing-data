```
ops.push(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert a null value into the `ops` array, which could cause errors later in the code when it is assumed that the array contains only valid data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last element from the `ops` array, which could cause errors later in the code when it is assumed that the array contains all the necessary data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.shift();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first element from the `ops` array, which could cause errors later in the code when it is assumed that the array contains all the necessary data.

DONE.
