Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it increases the length used for the operation by 1, potentially causing an off-by-one error in the composition logic, leading to incorrect results when composing operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the maximum length between the two iterators instead of the minimum, which could lead to more operations being included in the resulting delta than intended, altering the expected output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it decreases the length used for the operation by 1, which may cause some operations to be skipped or incorrectly processed, resulting in a delta that does not accurately reflect the intended composition of operations.

DONE.
