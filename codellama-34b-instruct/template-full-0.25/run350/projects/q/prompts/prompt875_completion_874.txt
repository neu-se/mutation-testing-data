  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` to create a callback that is passed to `setTimeout`, which is then used to reject the promise. However, this modified code would reject the promise immediately, without waiting for the timeout to expire.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` to create a callback that is passed to `setTimeout`, which is then used to reject the promise. However, this modified code would resolve the promise immediately, without waiting for the timeout to expire.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` to create a callback that is passed to `setTimeout`, which is then used to reject the promise.
