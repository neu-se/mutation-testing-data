  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = 'GET'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for...of` loop would only iterate over the `GET` verb, instead of all the verbs in the `verbs` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = 'POST'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for...of` loop would only iterate over the `POST` verb, instead of all the verbs in the `verbs` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = 'PUT'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for...of` loop would only iterate over the `PUT` verb, instead of all the verbs in the `verbs` object.

DONE.
