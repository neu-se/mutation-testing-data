Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'person', 'persons'
```
This would result in different behavior because the plural of "person" is incorrectly defined as "persons" instead of the correct "people," leading to incorrect pluralization for the word "person."

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'person', 'person'
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly defines the plural of "person" as the same word "person," which does not reflect the correct pluralization and would cause the function to return the singular form instead of the plural.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'person', 'peoples'
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly pluralizes "person" as "peoples," which is not a standard plural form and could lead to confusion in contexts where the correct plural "people" is expected.

DONE.
