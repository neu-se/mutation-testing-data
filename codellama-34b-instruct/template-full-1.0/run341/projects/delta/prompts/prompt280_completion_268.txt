  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the value is undefined or null, but by replacing it with null, it would only check if the value is null, and not undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the value is undefined or null, but by replacing it with undefined, it would only check if the value is undefined, and not null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the value is undefined or null, but by replacing it with 0, it would check if the value is either undefined or a falsy value, but it would not check if the value is null.

DONE.
