  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would decrement the index instead of incrementing it, potentially causing the loop to run indefinitely or skip over certain elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would increment the index by 2 instead of 1, potentially causing the loop to skip over certain elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index = index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would increment the index by 1, but the increment operator is not used, potentially causing the loop to run indefinitely or skip over certain elements.

DONE.
