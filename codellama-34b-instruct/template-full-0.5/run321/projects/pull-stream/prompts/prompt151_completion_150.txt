  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort` is a function that takes two arguments, but `abortCb` is a function that takes three arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because `abortCb` is called with three arguments, but the original code fragment only passed two arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort
```
This would result in different behavior because `abort` is a boolean value, but `abortCb` is a function.

DONE.
