 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
index + length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop condition checks if the index is less than or equal to the end index, and using `index + length` would cause the loop to iterate one more time than it should.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
index - length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` variable is used to keep track of the current position, and subtracting `length` from it would cause the loop to skip over some operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
index * length
```
This would result in different behavior because multiplying the index by the length would cause the loop to iterate much more than it should, potentially causing the function to enter an infinite loop.

DONE.
