Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof options === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check if `options` is an object instead of a string, which would lead to incorrect handling of encoding options.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
options !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `options` is not null, which would always be true unless `options` is explicitly set to null, and would lead to incorrect handling of encoding options.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof options === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `options` is a number, which is not a valid type for the `options` parameter in this context, and would lead to incorrect handling of encoding options.

DONE.
