Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the generator to continue executing instead of handling the error, potentially leading to unhandled promise rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` would effectively ignore any errors that occur, leading to silent failures instead of invoking the error handling logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` would cause the promise chain to not properly handle the error, resulting in unexpected behavior or crashes in the application.

DONE.
