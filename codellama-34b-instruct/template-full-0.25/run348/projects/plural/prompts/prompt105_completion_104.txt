  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep)\b/i, function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the word unchanged, while this new fragment appends an 's' to the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep)\b/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the word unchanged, while this new fragment removes the last character of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep)\b/i, function(w
