  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the method `dispatch` expects an object as its first argument, and `null` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the method `dispatch` expects an object as its first argument, and `undefined` is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` creates a new deferred object, which is not the object that `dispatch` expects as its first argument.

DONE.
