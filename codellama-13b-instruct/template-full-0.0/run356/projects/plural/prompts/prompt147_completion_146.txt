  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1](word, rule[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rule[1]` function is called with two arguments, `word` and `rule[0]`, whereas the original code only passes `word` as an argument. This could cause the function to behave differently, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1](rule[0], word)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rule[1]` function is called with two arguments, `rule[0]` and `word`, whereas the original code only passes `word` as an argument. This could cause the function to behave differently, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1](word, rule[0], rule[1])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rule[1]` function is called with three arguments, `word`, `rule[0]`, and `rule[
