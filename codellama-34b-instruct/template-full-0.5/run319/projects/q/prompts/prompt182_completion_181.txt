  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split("@")[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the part of the stack trace after the "@" symbol, which may not include the file name and line number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.replace(/^.*@/, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the part of the stack trace after the "@" symbol, which may not include the file name and line number, and it would also remove any text before the "@" symbol.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split(":")[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the part of the stack trace after the first colon, which may not include the line number or the file name.

DONE.
