  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [args, name]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments in the array is reversed, which could cause the method to be called with the wrong arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, args.reverse()]
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments array is reversed before being passed to the method, which could cause the method to be called with the wrong arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, args.slice(1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the first element of the arguments array is removed before being passed to the method, which could cause the method to be called with the wrong arguments.

DONE.
