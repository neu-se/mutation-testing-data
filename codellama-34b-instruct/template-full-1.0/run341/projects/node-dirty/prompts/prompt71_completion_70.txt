  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the expected return value of the `load` event is an integer, and using `-1` would cause the event to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the expected return value of the `load` event is an integer, and using `null` would cause the event to return a different data type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Hello, World!"
```
This would result in different behavior because the expected return value of the `load` event is an integer, and using a string would cause the event to return a different data type.

DONE.
