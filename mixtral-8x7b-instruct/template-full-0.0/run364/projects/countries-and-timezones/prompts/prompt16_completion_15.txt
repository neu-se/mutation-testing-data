 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].current = id;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would override the `current` array with a string value, instead of pushing the `id` into the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].current.concat(id);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not modify the original `current` array, but instead create a new array with the concatenated values, which would not affect the rest of the code relying on the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.push.call(result[country].current, id);
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `call` method to explicitly set the `this` context for the `push` method, which might cause issues if the `current` property is not an actual array or if the `push` method is overridden elsewhere in the code.

DONE.
