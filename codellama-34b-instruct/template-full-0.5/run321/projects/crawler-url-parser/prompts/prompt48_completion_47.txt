  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` value for the `slashesDenoteHost` parameter would cause the `//` in the URL to be treated as a path delimiter instead of a host delimiter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` value for the `search` parameter would cause the query string to be excluded from the parsed URL object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `true` value for the `search` parameter would cause the query string to be included in the parsed URL object, but the `false` value for the `slashesDenoteHost` parameter would cause the `//` in the URL to be treated as a path delimiter instead of a host delimiter
