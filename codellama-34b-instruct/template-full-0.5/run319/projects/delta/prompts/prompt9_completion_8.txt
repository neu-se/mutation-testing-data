  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const key in a) {
```
This would result in different behavior because `for...in` loops over the properties of an object in an arbitrary order, while the original code uses `Object.keys()` to iterate over the keys of the object in a specific order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const key of Object.keys(a)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because `for...of` loops over the values of an iterable object, while the original code uses `Object.keys()` to iterate over the keys of the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const key of Object.values(a)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values()` returns an array of the values of an object, while the original code uses `Object.keys()` to iterate over the keys of the object.

DONE.
