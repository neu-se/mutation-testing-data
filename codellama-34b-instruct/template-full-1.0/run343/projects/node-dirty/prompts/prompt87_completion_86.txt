  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.reverse();
```
This would result in different behavior because `arr.reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in the array, whereas `arr.pop()` removes the last element from the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.splice(0, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because `arr.splice(0, 1)` removes the first element from the array, whereas `arr.pop()` removes the last element from the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.shift();
```
This would result in different behavior because `arr.shift()` removes the first element from the array, whereas `arr.pop()` removes the last element from the array.

DONE.
