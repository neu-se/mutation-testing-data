  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the bearing between two points, while this modified code calculates the bearing between two points and then adds 180 degrees to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the bearing between two points, while this modified code calculates the bearing between two points and then multiplies it by 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing - 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the bearing between two points, while this modified code calculates the bearing between two points and then subtracts 180 degrees from it.

DONE.
