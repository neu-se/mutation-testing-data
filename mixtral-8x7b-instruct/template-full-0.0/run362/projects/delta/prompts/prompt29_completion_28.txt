 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.keys(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the keys of the `a` object instead of the `base` object. This could cause the inversion to include keys from `a` that should not be included, or exclude keys from `base` that should be included.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.keys(<any>[])
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns an empty object. This would cause the inversion to never include any keys from `base`, even if they should be included.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.keys(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the keys of the `b` object instead of the `base` object. This could cause the inversion to include keys from `b` that should not be included, or exclude keys from `base` that should be included.
