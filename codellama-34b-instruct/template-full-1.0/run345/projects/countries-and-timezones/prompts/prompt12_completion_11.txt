  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places
```
This would result in different behavior because `places` is a different object than `result`, and it does not have the same properties or methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.cities
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.cities` is a different property than `result`, and it may not have the same value or be defined in the same way.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.countries[id]
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.countries[id]` is a different object than `result`, and it may not have the same properties or methods.

DONE.
