  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush()
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush()` is a function call, whereas `flush` is a reference to the function itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 1000)
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` would delay the execution of `flush` by 1000 milliseconds, whereas the original code executes `flush` immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestAnimationFrame(flush)
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestAnimationFrame` would schedule `flush` to be executed before the next repaint, whereas the original code executes `flush` immediately.

DONE.
