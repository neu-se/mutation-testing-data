  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"put"
```
This would result in different behavior because "put" is not a valid method for a promise, and would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because "get" is a valid method for a promise, but it would not have the same effect as "post" in this context, as it would not cause the promise to be resolved with the given value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"resolve"
```
This would result in different behavior because "resolve" is a valid method for a promise, and would cause the promise to be resolved with the given value, which is not the intended behavior in this context.

DONE.
