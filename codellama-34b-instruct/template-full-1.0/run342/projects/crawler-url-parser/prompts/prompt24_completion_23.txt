  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^#[\w\d]+/
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches the `//` sequence at the beginning of the URL, instead of matching any characters until the end of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#[\w\d]+/
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches the `//` sequence at the beginning of the URL, instead of matching any characters until the end of the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/[\w\d]+/
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches the `/` sequence at the beginning of the URL, instead of matching the end of the URL.

DONE.
