  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would not be able to delete the key from the map, as the `undefined` value is not a valid key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would not be able to delete the key from the map, as the `null` value is not a valid key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would not be able to delete the key from the map, as the empty string is not a valid key.

DONE.
