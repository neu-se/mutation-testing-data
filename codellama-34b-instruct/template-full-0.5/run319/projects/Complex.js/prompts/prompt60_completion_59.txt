  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['phi']
```
This would result in different behavior because `a['phi']` is a different property than `a['r']`, and may have a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['r'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `a['r'] + 1` would add 1 to the value of `a['r']`, which could change the result of the expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['r'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `a['r'] * 2` would double the value of `a['r']`, which could change the result of the expression.

DONE.
