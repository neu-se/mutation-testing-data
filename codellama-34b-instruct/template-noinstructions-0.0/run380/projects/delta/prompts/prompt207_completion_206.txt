  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would push the `otherOp` object onto the `delta` array, while the modified code fragment would push `null` onto the `delta` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would push the `otherOp` object onto the `delta` array, while the modified code fragment would push `undefined` onto the `delta` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would push the `otherOp` object onto the `delta` array, while the modified code fragment would push an empty object onto the `delta` array.

DONE.
