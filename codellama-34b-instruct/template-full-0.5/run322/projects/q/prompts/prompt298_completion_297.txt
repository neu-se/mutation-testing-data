  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` returns a new deferred object, while `Q` is a function that returns a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` returns a rejected promise, while `Q` is a function that returns a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve()` returns a resolved promise, while `Q` is a function that returns a promise.

DONE.
