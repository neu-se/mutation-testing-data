  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"when", args
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the "when" operator to call the "dispatch" method, while the buggy code fragment uses the "when" operator to call the "post" method. This could cause the test suite to fail if the "dispatch" method is not properly tested.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", args
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the "post" operator to call the "dispatch" method, while the buggy code fragment uses the "post" operator to call the "post" method.
