  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (a = { 're': 0, 'im': 0 })
```
This would result in different behavior because it assigns the object to the variable `a` and then checks if it is truthy, which would always be true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (a ^ { 're': 0, 'im': 0 })
```
This would result in different behavior because it performs a bitwise XOR operation on `a` and the object, which would always return a non-zero result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (a && a != { 're': 0, 'im': 0 })
```
This would result in different behavior because it first checks if `a` is truthy, and then if it is not equal to the object. This would allow for the object to still be passed as a valid argument, as long as it is not the exact object that was expected.

DONE.
