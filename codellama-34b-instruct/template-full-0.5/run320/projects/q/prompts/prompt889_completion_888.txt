  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the second argument instead of the first to the `nfapply` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a slice of the arguments array, starting from the second element and including only two elements, instead of passing the entire arguments array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1).concat(array_slice(arguments, 2))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a concatenation of the second element of the arguments array and the entire arguments array, starting from the second element, instead of passing the entire arguments array.

DONE.
