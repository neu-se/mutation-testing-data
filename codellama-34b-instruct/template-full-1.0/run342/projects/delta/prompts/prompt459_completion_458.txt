  Sure, I'd be happy to help!

Here are three options for replacing the `PLACEHOLDER` with a buggy code fragment:

Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(this.index + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an empty array instead of the rest of the `ops` array.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(this.index + 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the wrong slice of the `ops` array.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(this.index - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the `ops` array that does not include the current `index`.

DONE.
