 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([.$])/
```
This would result in different behavior because it only matches '$' or '.' characters, while the original code fragment escapes them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([^$])/g
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches any character except '$', while the original code fragment matches '$' or '.' characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([.$])/
```
This would result in different behavior because it doesn't escape the matched characters, while the original code fragment does.

DONE.
