  Option 1:
The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` returns the cosine of a number, while `sinh` returns the hyperbolic sine of a number.

Option 2:
The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because `1` is not a function and would cause a type error when trying to access the property `cos` of a number.

Option 3:
The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
foo.bar
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to access the property `bar` of a non-existent variable `foo`.

DONE.
