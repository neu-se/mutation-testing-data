  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause `array_slice` to return a slice of the `arguments` array starting from the second argument, rather than the first, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the `fbound` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(...args, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `fbound` function to expect two separate arguments, `args` and `arguments`, rather than a single `args` array argument, which could lead to unexpected behavior when the `fbound` function is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `fbound` function to return `null` as the value of the `args` argument, rather than the actual value of the `args` argument, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the `array_slice` function.

DONE.
