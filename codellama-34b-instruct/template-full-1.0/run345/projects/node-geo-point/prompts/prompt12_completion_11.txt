  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
! point.type || point.type === 'Point'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `fromGeoJSON` function to be called with any object that has a `type` property, regardless of its value. The original code fragment required that the `type` property must have the exact value `'Point'`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type === 'Point' || point.type === 'Point'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `fromGeoJSON` function to be called with any object that has a `type` property, regardless of its value. The original code fragment required that the `type` property must have the exact value `'Point'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
! point.type && point.coordinates.length === 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `fromGeoJSON` function to be called with any object that has a
