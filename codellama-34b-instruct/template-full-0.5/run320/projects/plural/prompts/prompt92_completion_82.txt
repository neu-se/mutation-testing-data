  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chilli'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the singular form of the word, "chilli," instead of the plural form, "chillies."

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chillis'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the plural form of the word, "chillis," instead of the singular form, "chilli."

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chillies' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the plural form of the word, "chillies," with an extra "s" added to the end, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
