  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.delete === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.delete` is a number, while this new code checks if it's a string. This could cause the `delete` operation to be misinterpreted as a `retain` operation, leading to incorrect behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.delete !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.delete` is a number, while this new code checks if it's not a number. This could cause the `delete` operation to be misinterpreted as a `retain` operation, leading to incorrect behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.delete` is a number, while this new code checks if it's undefined. This could cause the `delete` operation
