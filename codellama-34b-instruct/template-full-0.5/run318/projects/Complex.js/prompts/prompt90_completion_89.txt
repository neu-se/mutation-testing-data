  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + '0'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always add the string '0' to the result, regardless of the value of `minus` or `tokens[i + 1]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + (tokens[i + 1] || '0')
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would add the value of `tokens[i + 1]` to the result, or the string '0' if `tokens[i + 1]` is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + ('0' + tokens[i + 1])
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would concatenate the string '0' with the value of `tokens[i + 1]`, regardless of the value of `
