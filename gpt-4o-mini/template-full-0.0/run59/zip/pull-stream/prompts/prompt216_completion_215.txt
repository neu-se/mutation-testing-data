Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the callback to be invoked with `null` instead of the actual error, potentially leading to silent failures where the error is ignored.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `data` variable to the `next` function instead of the error, which could lead to incorrect handling of the data and potentially cause unexpected results in the processing flow.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a string `'error'` as the first argument to the `next` function instead of the actual error object, which could lead to type mismatches and incorrect error handling in the subsequent logic.

DONE.
