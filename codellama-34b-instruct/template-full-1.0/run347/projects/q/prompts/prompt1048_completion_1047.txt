  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` would resolve the promise immediately, instead of rejecting it, which is the intended behavior in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("custom error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject(new Error("custom error"))` would reject the promise with a custom error message, instead of using the default error message of the `Q.reject` method, which is the intended behavior in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer().reject` would create a new deferred object and reject the promise with a new error message, instead of using the original deferred object and the default error message of the `Q.reject` method, which is the intended behavior in the original code fragment.
