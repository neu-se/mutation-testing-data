  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close', resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the event `'close'` is emitted when the output stream is closed, while the event `'error'` is emitted when there is an error in the stream. By replacing `'error'` with `'close'`, the promise would resolve even if there is an error in the stream, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would resolve even if there is an error in the stream, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end', reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the event `'end'` is emitted when the output stream is closed, while the event `'error'` is emitted when there is an error in the stream. By replacing `'error'` with `'end'`, the promise would reject even if there is no error in the stream, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
