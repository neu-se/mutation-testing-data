  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value[name]()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is calling the `apply` method on the `value[name]` object, while this replacement code fragment is calling the `value[name]` function directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value[name].call
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is calling the `apply` method on the `value[name]` object, while this replacement code fragment is calling the `call` method on the `value[name]` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value[name].bind
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is calling the `apply` method on the `value[name]` object, while this replacement code fragment is calling the `bind` method on the `value[name]` object.

DONE.
