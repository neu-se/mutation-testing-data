 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it always passes an empty array as the arguments to the callback function, instead of the actual arguments passed in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes the current context (this) as the arguments to the callback function, instead of the actual arguments passed in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
42
```
This would result in different behavior because it always passes the number 42 as the arguments to the callback function, regardless of the actual arguments passed in the original code.

DONE.
