  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `word` variable as-is, while this replacement would convert the word to lowercase before applying the pluralization rules.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `word` variable as-is, while this replacement would use the length of the word instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.charAt(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `word` variable as-is, while this replacement would use the first character of the word instead.

DONE.
