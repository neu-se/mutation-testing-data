  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is not the same as `b`, and it would change the result of the `Math.pow` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c
```
This would result in different behavior because `c` is not the same as `b`, and it would change the result of the `Math.pow` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d
```
This would result in different behavior because `d` is not the same as `b`, and it would change the result of the `Math.pow` function.

DONE.
