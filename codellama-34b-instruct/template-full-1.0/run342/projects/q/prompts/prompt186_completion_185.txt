  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/at ([^ \t]+):(\d+):(?:\d+)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match strings that contain tabs after the function name, which may not be intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/at ([^ \t]+):(\d+):(?:\d+)$/.test
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a boolean value instead of an array with the matched substrings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/at ([^ \t]+):(\d+):(?:\d+)$/.groups
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array with the matched groups instead of an array with the matched substrings.

DONE.
