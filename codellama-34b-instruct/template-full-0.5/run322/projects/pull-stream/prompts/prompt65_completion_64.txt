  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(end)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `done` function with `end` as an argument, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `done` function with `null` as an argument, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `done` function with `true` as an argument, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

DONE.
