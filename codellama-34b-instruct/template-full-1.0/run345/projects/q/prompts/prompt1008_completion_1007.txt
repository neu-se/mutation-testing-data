  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `arguments` object, which is a built-in property of functions in JavaScript, whereas `null` is a primitive value that represents the absence of any object value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `arguments` object, which is a built-in property of functions in JavaScript, whereas `undefined` is a primitive value that represents an uninitialized or non-existent variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `arguments` object, which is a built-in property of functions in JavaScript, whereas `this` is a keyword that references the current execution context in JavaScript.

DONE.
