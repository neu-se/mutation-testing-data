  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return (rad2deg(θ) + 370) % 360;
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing calculation would be off by 10 degrees.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return (rad2deg(θ) + 360) % 361;
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing calculation would wrap around and be off by one degree.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return (rad2deg(θ) + 359) % 360;
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing calculation would wrap around and be off by one degree in the opposite direction.

DONE.
