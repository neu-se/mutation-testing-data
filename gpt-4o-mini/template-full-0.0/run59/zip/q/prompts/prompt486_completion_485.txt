Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons = [];
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly assigns an empty array to `unhandledReasons`, effectively clearing it but not resetting `unhandledRejections`, which could lead to untracked rejections persisting in the system.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections = true;
unhandledRejections.length = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets `trackUnhandledRejections` to true but does not clear `unhandledReasons`, which means that the reasons for unhandled rejections would still be retained even though tracking is supposedly enabled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets `unhandledRejections` to `null`, which would break any subsequent logic that expects `unhandledRejections` to be an array, potentially causing runtime errors when trying to access or manipulate it.

DONE.
