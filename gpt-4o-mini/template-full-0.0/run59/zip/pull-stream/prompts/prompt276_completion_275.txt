Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately switch to the next stream without processing the current chunk, potentially skipping data that should have been read.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the callback with `null` data, indicating that no data is available, which could lead to unexpected handling of the stream by the consumer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read(true, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly pass `true` to `_read`, which may not be a valid argument for the stream, potentially causing an error or unexpected behavior in the stream processing.

DONE.
