  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return Q(value); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new `Promise` object with the value, which would then be resolved instead of just returning the value directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return value + 1; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different value than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return value.then(function (v) { return v + 1; }); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would apply a different transformation to the value before returning it.

DONE.
