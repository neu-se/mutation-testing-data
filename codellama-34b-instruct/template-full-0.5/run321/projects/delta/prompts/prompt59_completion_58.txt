  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.ops.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the `ops` array starting from the second element, instead of the original code which returns the entire `ops` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.ops.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `ops` array in reverse order, instead of the original code which returns the `ops` array in its original order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.ops.filter(op => op.retain)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a filtered version of the `ops` array, containing only the `retain` operations, instead of the original code which returns the entire `ops` array.

DONE.
