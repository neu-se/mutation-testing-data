  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This change will cause the `toVector` method to return a vector with a different imaginary part than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This change will cause the `toVector` method to return a vector with a different imaginary part than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - 1
```
This change will cause the `toVector` method to return a vector with a different imaginary part than the original code.

DONE.
