  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `_writeFileSync` is a synchronous version of `_writeFile`, and it would cause the `writeFile` function to block until the file is written, which could lead to performance issues.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_writeFileAsync
```
This would result in different behavior because `_writeFileAsync` is an asynchronous version of `_writeFile`, and it would cause the `writeFile` function to return a promise that resolves when the file is written, which could lead to race conditions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_writeFileWithCallback
```
This would result in different behavior because `_writeFileWithCallback` is a version of `_writeFile` that takes a callback function as an argument, and it would cause the `writeFile` function to call the callback function when the file is written, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
