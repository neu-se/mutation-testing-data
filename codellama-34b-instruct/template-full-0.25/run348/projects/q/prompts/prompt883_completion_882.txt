  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise with the error, instead of rejecting it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` would notify the promise with the error, instead of rejecting it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject("Different error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with a different error message.

DONE.
