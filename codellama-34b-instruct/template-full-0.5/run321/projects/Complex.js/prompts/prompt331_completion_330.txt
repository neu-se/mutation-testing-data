  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality, while the modified code fragment checks for greater than zero. This would cause the if statement to evaluate to a different value, potentially causing the code to execute a different branch.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality, while the modified code fragment checks for less than zero. This would cause the if statement to evaluate to a different value, potentially causing the code to execute a different branch.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality with a finite value, while the modified code fragment checks for equality with infinity. This would cause the if statement to evaluate to a different value, potentially causing the code to execute a different branch.

DONE.
