  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && test(data)
```
This change will cause the `read` function to return `loop = true` if `end` is truthy and `test(data)` is truthy, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end || test(data)
```
This change will cause the `read` function to return `loop = true` if `end` is falsy or `test(data)` is truthy, which is different from the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && !test(data)
```
This change will cause the `read` function to return `loop = true` if `end` is truthy and `test(data)` is falsy, which is different from the original behavior.

DONE.
