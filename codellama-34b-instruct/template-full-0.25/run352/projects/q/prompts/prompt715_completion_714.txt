  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.foo
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the `foo` property of `object`, rather than the value of `object` itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the first element of `object`, rather than the value of `object` itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.bar
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the `bar` property of `object`, rather than the value of `object` itself.

DONE.
