  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, progressed, void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments has been changed, which could cause the progressed function to be called with the wrong arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressed, void 0, void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the progressed function is now being called with the wrong arguments, which could cause it to behave incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, void 0, void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the progressed function is no longer being called at all, which could cause the promise to never be resolved or rejected.

DONE.
