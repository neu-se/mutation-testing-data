  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const opLength = Math.min(otherIter.peekLength(), length);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `otherIter` object instead of `thisIter`, which could lead to a different result in the `diffResult` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const opLength = Math.max(otherIter.peekLength(), length);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the maximum of the two lengths instead of the minimum, which could lead to a different result in the `diffResult` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const opLength = length - otherIter.peekLength();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the length of the `otherIter` object from the `length` variable, which could lead to a different result in the `diffResult` variable.

DONE.
