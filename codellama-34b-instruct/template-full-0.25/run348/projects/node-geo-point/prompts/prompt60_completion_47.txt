  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `cos` is the cosine function, which has a different output than `sin` for the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 - sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `1 - sin` is always equal to `cos`, but with a different output for negative inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(x + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin(x + 1)` is always equal to `sin(x)` plus a constant, but with a different output for large inputs.

DONE.
