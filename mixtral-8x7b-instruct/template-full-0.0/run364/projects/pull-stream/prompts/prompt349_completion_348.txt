 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` when the `test` argument is an object with a `test` property that is a function. In the original code, the returned function would call `test.test(data)`, but with this mutation, it would call `test.test(null)`, which would likely cause a test failure if the `test` function was expecting a specific argument value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when the `test` argument is an object with a `test` property that is a function. In the original code, the returned function would call `test.test(data)`, but with this mutation, it would call `test.test(1)`, which would likely cause a test failure if the `test` function was expecting a specific argument type.
