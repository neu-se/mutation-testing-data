  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!filter(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation operator (!) would be applied to the result of the `filter` function, which would flip the truthiness of the result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filter(data, !test)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` function would be called with a different set of arguments, which could change its behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function would be called with the same arguments as the original `filter` function, but the result would be negated by the `!` operator, which could change the behavior of the code.

DONE.
