  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.then(function () {
    throw new Error("Q is not defined");
})
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q` is not defined, and the `then` method would not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.then(function () {
    return "Hello, world!";
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would return a string instead of a promise, and the `done` method would not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.then(function () {
    return Q.reject("Error");
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would return a rejected promise, and the `done` method would not be called.

DONE.
