  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"throw"
```
This would result in different behavior because "throw" is a different operator than "next", and would cause the generator to throw an error instead of continuing to the next iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"return"
```
This would result in different behavior because "return" is a different operator than "next", and would cause the generator to exit early instead of continuing to the next iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"yield"
```
This would result in different behavior because "yield" is a different operator than "next", and would cause the generator to pause execution and return a value to the calling context instead of continuing to the next iteration.

DONE.
