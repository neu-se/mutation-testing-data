  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was removing the index file extension, but the new code fragment would remove the entire path after the index file extension.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '/default'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was removing the index file extension, but the new code fragment would replace the index file extension with the string "/default".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '/default\.[a-z]+$'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was removing the index file extension, but the new code fragment would replace the index file extension with the string "/default" followed by the original file extension.

DONE.
