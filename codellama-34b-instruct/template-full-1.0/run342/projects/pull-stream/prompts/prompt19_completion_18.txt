  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument of the `pull` function is being used instead of the second.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the last argument of the `pull` function is being used instead of the second.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[Math.floor(Math.random() * length)]
```
This would result in different behavior because a random argument of the `pull` function is being used instead of the second.

DONE.
