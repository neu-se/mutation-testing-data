  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point, this
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the arguments in the `calculateBearing` method, potentially causing the method to return an incorrect value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude, this.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the longitude and latitude values of the `this` object as separate arguments to the `calculateBearing` method, potentially causing the method to return an incorrect value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.longitude, point.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the longitude and latitude values of the `point` object as separate arguments to the `calculateBearing` method, potentially causing the method to return an incorrect value.

DONE.
