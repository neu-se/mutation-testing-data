  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^\uFEFF/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/^\uFEFF/` matches the Unicode byte order mark (BOM) at the beginning of the string, and the `replace` method replaces it with an empty string. This would cause the BOM to be removed from the string, which could affect the behavior of the `stringify` function if it relies on the BOM being present.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^\uFEFF/, ' ')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/^\uFEFF/` matches the Unicode byte order mark (BOM) at the beginning of the string, and the `replace` method replaces it with a space character. This would cause the BOM to be replaced with a space character, which could affect the behavior of the `stringify` function if it relies on the BOM being present.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
