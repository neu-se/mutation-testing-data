  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain && domain.exit()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `domain.exit()` method would be called even if `domain` is falsy, which could cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain || domain.exit()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `domain.exit()` method would only be called if `domain` is truthy, which could cause the code to behave differently if `domain` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain ? domain.exit() : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `domain.exit()` method would only be called if `domain` is truthy, and `null` would be returned if `domain` is falsy.

DONE.
