  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the `insert` property of `otherOp` instead of the entire `otherOp` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the `delete` property of `otherOp` instead of the entire `otherOp` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the `retain` property of `otherOp` instead of the entire `otherOp` object.

DONE.
