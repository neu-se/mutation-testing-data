  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basename.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the lowercase version of the basename, even if the original code fragment returned a different case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the basename of the `options.dest` path, which may be different from the basename of the `options.url` path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodeURIComponent(path.basename(options.url))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decode the basename of the `options.url` path, which may be different from the original code fragment that only decoded the `options.dest` path.

DONE.
