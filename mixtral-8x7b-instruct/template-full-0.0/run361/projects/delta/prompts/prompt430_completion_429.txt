 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always check the length of the current operation, instead of checking if the remaining length is less than infinity. This could cause issues when there are operations with a length of 0 or Infinity.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
100
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set a fixed limit of 100 for the length, which might not be suitable for all operations. This could cause the iterator to stop prematurely or skip operations if the length is greater than 100.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always compare the index with 1, instead of checking the length of the current operation. This could cause issues when there are operations with a length of 0 or Infinity, or when the index is not increment
