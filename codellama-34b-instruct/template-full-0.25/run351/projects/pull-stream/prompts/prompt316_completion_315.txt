  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
last ? cb(null, data) : terminate(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `terminate` is called when `last` is false, but in this new code fragment, `terminate` is called when `last` is true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
last ? cb(null, data) : read(ended, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `terminate` is called when `last` is false, but in this new code fragment, `read` is called when `last` is true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
last ? cb(null, data) : cb(ended)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `terminate` is called when `last` is false, but in this new code fragment, `cb` is called when `last` is true.

DONE.
