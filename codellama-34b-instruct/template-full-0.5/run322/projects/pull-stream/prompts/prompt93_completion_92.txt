  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call, but in this replacement, it is being assigned to the variable `cb`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(data, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call with two arguments, but in this replacement, it is being called with only one argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(data, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call with two arguments, but in this replacement, it is being called with the same argument twice.

DONE.
