  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `resolvedPromise` is truthy, while this new code fragment checks if `resolvedPromise` is strictly equal to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `resolvedPromise` is truthy, while this new code fragment checks if `resolvedPromise` is not strictly equal to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `resolvedPromise` is truthy, while this new code fragment checks if `resolvedPromise` is falsy.

DONE.
