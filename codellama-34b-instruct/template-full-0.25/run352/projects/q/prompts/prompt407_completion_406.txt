  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isPromise(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `isPromise` function, so if the original code fragment returned `true`, the new code fragment would return `false`, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPromiseAlike` function checks if the value is an object with a `then` method, which is a common characteristic of promises, but not all promises have this characteristic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFulfilled(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFulfilled` function checks if the value is a fulfilled promise, which means that it has been resolved with a value. If the original code fragment returned `true`, the new code fragment would return `false` if the promise is pending or rejected.
