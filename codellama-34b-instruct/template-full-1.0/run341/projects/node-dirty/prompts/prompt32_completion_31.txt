  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"key" + "something"
```
This would result in different behavior because it is a string concatenation operation, while the original code is just a reference to the "key" variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"key" + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it is a string concatenation operation with a number, while the original code is just a reference to the "key" variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it is a null reference, while the original code is just a reference to the "key" variable.

DONE.
