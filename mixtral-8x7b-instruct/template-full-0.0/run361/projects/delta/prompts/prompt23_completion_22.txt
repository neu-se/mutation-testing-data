 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
a['key']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always look for the string 'key' instead of using the variable `key` for property access.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the value with 0 if the key exists in the object, regardless of the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the value with `undefined` if the key exists in the object, which might not be the desired behavior when comparing objects.

DONE.
