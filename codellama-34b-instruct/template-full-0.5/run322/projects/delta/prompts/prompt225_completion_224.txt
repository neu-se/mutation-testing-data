  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[1], strings[0], cursor
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the diff algorithm to compare the second string to the first string, rather than the first string to the second string, which could produce different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0], strings[1], cursor + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the diff algorithm to start comparing the strings at a different index, which could produce different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0], strings[1], cursor - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the diff algorithm to start comparing the strings at a different index, which could produce different results.

DONE.
