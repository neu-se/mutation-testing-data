  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toLocaleString
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toLocaleString` is a different method than `Object.prototype.toString`, and it may have a different implementation or behavior in the context of the code.
