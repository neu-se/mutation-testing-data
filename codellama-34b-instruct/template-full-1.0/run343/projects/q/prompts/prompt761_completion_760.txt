  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function rejected(err) {
    return Q(when(err, id, id));
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `onRejected` callback to be called with a resolved promise, which would then be handled by the `when` function, potentially causing it to return a different value than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function resolved(result) {
    return Q(when(result, id, id));
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `onFulfilled` callback to be called with a resolved promise, which would then be handled by the `when` function, potentially causing it to return a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function resolved(result) {
