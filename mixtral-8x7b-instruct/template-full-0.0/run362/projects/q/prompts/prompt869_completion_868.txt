 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with a null value instead of the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
42
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with a constant value instead of the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with a random value instead of the original value.

DONE.
