  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is a function, and `match === undefined` would always be `false`, even if `match` is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is a function, and `match !== null` would always be `true`, even if `match` is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is a function, and `match.length` would always be `0`, even if `match` is not defined.

DONE.
