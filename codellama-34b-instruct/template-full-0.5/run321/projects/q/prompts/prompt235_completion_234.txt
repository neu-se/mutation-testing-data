  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first argument to the `promiseDispatch` method, whereas the original code passes all the arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass all but the first argument to the `promiseDispatch` method, whereas the original code passes all the arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat(["extra"])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass all the arguments plus an extra argument "extra", whereas the original code passes only the arguments.

DONE.
