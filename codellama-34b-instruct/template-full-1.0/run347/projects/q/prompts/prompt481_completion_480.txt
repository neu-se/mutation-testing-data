  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var at = array_indexOf(unhandledReasons, reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would try to find the reason in the `unhandledReasons` array instead of the `unhandledRejections` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var at = array_indexOf(unhandledRejections, reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would try to find the reason in the `unhandledRejections` array instead of the `unhandledReasons` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var at = reason;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would try to find the reason in the `unhandledReasons` array instead of the `unhandledRejections` array, and it would also remove the corresponding reason from the `unhandledReasons` array.

DONE.
