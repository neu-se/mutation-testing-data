  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.insert.substring
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring` is a different method than `substr`, and it may return a different substring of the original string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.insert.substr(0, length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a substring of the original string with a different length than the original `substr` call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.insert.substr(length, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a substring of the original string starting from a different position than the original `substr` call.

DONE.
