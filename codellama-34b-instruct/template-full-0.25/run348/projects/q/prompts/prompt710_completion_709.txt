  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("keys", [])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the "keys" method on the object, which is not the same as calling the "dispatch" method with the "keys" argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("values", [])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the "values" method on the object, which is not the same as calling the "dispatch" method with the "keys" argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("length", [])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the "length" method on the object, which is not the same as calling the "dispatch" method with the "keys" argument.

DONE.
