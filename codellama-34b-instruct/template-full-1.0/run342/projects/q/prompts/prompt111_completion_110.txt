  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis
```
This would result in different behavior because `basis` is being used as an accumulator in the `reduce` function, and returning it as the basis for the output array will result in the function only returning a single value, rather than a collection of transformed values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid value to be returned inside the `map` function. The function would throw an error if it encounters a `null` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid value to be returned inside the `map` function. The function would throw an error if it encounters an `undefined` value.

DONE.
