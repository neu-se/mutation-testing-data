  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the substring starting position from the end of the word to the beginning, resulting in a different substring being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the substring starting position from the end of the word to the beginning and then negate the result, resulting in a different substring being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the substring starting position from the end of the word to the beginning and then subtract 1 from the length of the word, resulting in a different substring being returned.

DONE.
