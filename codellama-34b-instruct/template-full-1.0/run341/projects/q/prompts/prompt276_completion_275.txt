  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the reject method expects an error object as an argument, but passing null would cause the promise to be fulfilled instead of rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the reject method expects an error object as an argument, but passing undefined would cause the promise to be fulfilled instead of rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('some error')
```
This would result in different behavior because the reject method expects an error object as an argument, but passing a new Error object with a custom message would cause the promise to be rejected with a different error message.

DONE.
