  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFile
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFile` is an asynchronous function that returns a promise, whereas `fs.readFileSync` is a synchronous function that returns the contents of the file directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFile.bind(fs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFile.bind(fs)` is a bound function that returns a function that can be called with the file path as an argument, whereas `fs.readFileSync` is a synchronous function that takes the file path as an argument and returns the contents of the file directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFile.bind(fs, file)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFile.bind(fs, file)` is a bound function that returns a function that can be called with no arguments, whereas `fs.readFileSync` is a synchronous
