  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis|thesis/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional "thesis" at the end of the regular expression would cause the function to return the same value for both "thesis" and "crisis", which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis|crisis/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional "crisis" at the end of the regular expression would cause the function to return the same value for both "thesis" and "crisis", which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis|thesis|crisis/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional "thesis" and "crisis" at the end of the regular expression would cause the function to return the same value for all three words, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
