 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisData && otherData
```
This would result in different behavior because it always evaluates to true if both `thisData` and `otherData` are not null or undefined, even if they are not objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(thisData).length > 0 && Object.keys(otherData).length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if both `thisData` and `otherData` have any properties, instead of checking if they are objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(thisData) && Array.isArray(otherData)
