  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.calculateDistance
```
This would result in different behavior because `GeoPoint.calculateDistance` returns a different value than `GeoPoint.calculateBearing`, which is the original code fragment that was replaced.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.calculateDestination
```
This would result in different behavior because `GeoPoint.calculateDestination` returns a different value than `GeoPoint.calculateBearing`, which is the original code fragment that was replaced.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<other code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because it is a different code fragment than the original code fragment that was replaced.

DONE.
