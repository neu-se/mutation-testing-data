  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, _value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `cb` function if `value` is not null, while the new code fragment calls the `cb` function regardless of the value of `value`. This change would cause the function to return a different result when `value` is null, which could potentially cause issues in the code that uses this function.
