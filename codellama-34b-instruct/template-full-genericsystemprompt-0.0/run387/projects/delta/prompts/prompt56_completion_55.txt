  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `ops.slice()` creates a shallow copy of the `ops` array, while `ops` itself is a reference to the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `ops.concat()` creates a new array by concatenating the elements of `ops` with the elements of another array, while `ops` itself is a reference to the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.splice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `ops.splice()` modifies the original `ops` array by removing or replacing elements, while `ops` itself is a reference to the original array.

DONE.
