  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to exit immediately, without iterating through the rest of the `Delta` ops.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to run indefinitely, even if there are no more ops to iterate through.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to skip over the first op in the `Delta`, which might have important attributes or data that need to be considered when diffing the two `Delta`s.

DONE.
