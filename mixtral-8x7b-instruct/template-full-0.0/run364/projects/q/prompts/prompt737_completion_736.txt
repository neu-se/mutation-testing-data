 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.keys(promises).length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the number of keys in the promises object instead of the length of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
promises.constructor === Array && promises.length === 0
