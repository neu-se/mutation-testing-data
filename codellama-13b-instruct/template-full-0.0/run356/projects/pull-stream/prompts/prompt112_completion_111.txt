  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `acc` variable would be assigned the value of `data` instead of the result of the `reducer` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = reducer(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `acc` variable would be assigned the result of the `reducer` function instead of the value of `data`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = reducer(acc, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `acc` variable would be assigned the result of the `reducer` function with the current value of `acc` and the value of `data` as arguments instead of the value of `data` alone.

DONE.
