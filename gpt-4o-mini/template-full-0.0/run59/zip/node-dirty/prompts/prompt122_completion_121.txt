Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an 'error' event instead of a 'drain' event, which could lead to the application not properly handling the completion of write operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'write_close'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a 'write_close' event instead of a 'drain' event, potentially causing downstream listeners to miss the signal that the write operations have completed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a 'load' event instead of a 'drain' event, which could confuse the event handling logic that expects a 'drain' event to indicate that the write stream is ready for more data.

DONE.
