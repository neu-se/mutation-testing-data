  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is an integer, while `a + 1` is a float. The `expm1` function is sensitive to small changes in its input, and the difference between `a` and `a + 1` can cause a significant change in the output.
