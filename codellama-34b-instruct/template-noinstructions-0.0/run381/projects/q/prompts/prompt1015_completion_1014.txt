  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a reference to a function, while this replacement is a function call, which would result in a different value being passed to the `nodeArgs.push()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment did not pass any arguments to the `makeNodeResolver()` method, while this replacement passes `null` as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(deferred.promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment did not pass any arguments to the `makeNodeResolver()` method, while this replacement passes `deferred.promise` as an argument.

DONE.
