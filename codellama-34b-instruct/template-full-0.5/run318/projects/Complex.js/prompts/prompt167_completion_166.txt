  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` checks if the value is not a number, while `isZero` checks if the value is zero. This would cause the code to produce different results for certain inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the real part of the complex number is zero, while `isZero` checks if the imaginary part is zero. This would cause the code to produce different results for certain inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the imaginary part of the complex number is zero, while `isZero` checks if the real part is zero. This would cause the code to produce different results for certain inputs.

DONE.
