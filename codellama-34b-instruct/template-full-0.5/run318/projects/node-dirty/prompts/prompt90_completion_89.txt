  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('Empty lines never appear in a healthy database'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the row is empty and emits an error if it is, while the modified code always emits an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('Invalid row format'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the row is in a valid format and emits an error if it is not, while the modified code always emits an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('Different error message'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits an error with a specific message, while the modified code emits an error with a different message.

DONE.
