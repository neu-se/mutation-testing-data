  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
++index > length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the greater than or equal to operator, while this replacement uses the greater than operator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index++ >= length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the postfix increment operator, while this replacement uses the prefix increment operator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index++ > length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the greater than or equal to operator, while this replacement uses the greater than operator.

DONE.
