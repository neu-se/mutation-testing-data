  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would omit the first argument of the `nfbind` function, which is the callback function. This could cause the function to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would omit the first two arguments of the `nfbind` function, which are the callback function and the `this` context. This could cause the function to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would omit the first three arguments of the `nfbind` function, which are the callback function, the `this` context, and the arguments array. This could cause the function to fail or behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
