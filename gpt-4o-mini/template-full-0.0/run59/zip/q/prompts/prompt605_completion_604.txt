Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.promiseResolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to call a non-existent method `promiseResolve` instead of the correct `promiseDispatch`, leading to a runtime error when the method is invoked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.promiseReject
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to call a non-existent method `promiseReject`, which would also cause a runtime error, preventing the promise from resolving or dispatching correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.promiseDispatch.bind(self)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the context of `promiseDispatch` to the current `self`, which may not be the intended context, potentially leading to incorrect behavior or errors when the method is executed.

DONE.
