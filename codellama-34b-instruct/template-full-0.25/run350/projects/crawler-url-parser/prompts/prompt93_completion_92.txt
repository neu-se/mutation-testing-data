  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(href, baseUrlStr, { normalizeHttps: true });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `normalizeHttps` option would cause the `parse` function to normalize HTTPS URLs, which would not be the case with the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(href, baseUrlStr, { normalizeProtocol: false });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `normalizeProtocol` option would cause the `parse` function to not normalize the protocol, which would not be the case with the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(href, baseUrlStr, { removeDirectoryIndex: false });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `removeDirectoryIndex` option would cause the `parse` function to not remove the directory index, which would not be the case with the original code fragment.

DONE.
