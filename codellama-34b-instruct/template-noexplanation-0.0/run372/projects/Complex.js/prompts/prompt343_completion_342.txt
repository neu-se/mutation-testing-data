  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This change will cause the `sinh` function to return the sine of the input value instead of the cosine, which is the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This change will cause the `sinh` function to return the tangent of the input value instead of the cosine, which is the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.csc
```
This change will cause the `sinh` function to return the cosecant of the input value instead of the cosine, which is the intended behavior.

DONE.
