  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deprecated !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `deprecated` is `true`, while the new code fragment checks if it is not `true`. This would cause the `deliverTimezones` function to return a different set of timezones, potentially causing issues with the rest of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `deprecated` is `true`, while the new code fragment checks if it is not `false`. This would cause the `deliverTimezones` function to return a different set of timezones, potentially causing issues with the rest of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deprecated === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `deprecated` is `true`, while the new code fragment checks if it is `false`.
