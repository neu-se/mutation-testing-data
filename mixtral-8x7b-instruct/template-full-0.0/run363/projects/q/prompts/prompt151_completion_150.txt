 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
stacks.unshift("DUMMY")
```
This would result in different behavior because it prepends a dummy string to the `stacks` array, changing the content and potentially causing the `filterStackString` function to filter or exclude frames incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
stacks = []
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `stacks` array with an empty one, causing the `filterStackString` function to not filter any frames and return an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
stacks.unshift(promise.stack)
```
This would result in different behavior because it prepends the `promise.stack` to the `stacks` array, changing the order of the stack traces and potentially causing the `filterStackString` function to filter or exclude frames incorrectly.

DONE.
