  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `div` method to always return `Complex['INFINITY']`, regardless of the input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `div` method to always return `Complex['NAN']`, regardless of the input values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero'] && z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `div` method to return `Complex['ZERO']` when the divisor is infinite and the dividend is zero, which is not the correct result.

DONE.
