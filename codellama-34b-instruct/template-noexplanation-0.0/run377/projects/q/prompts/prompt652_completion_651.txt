  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This change will cause the `dispatch` method to receive one fewer argument than it expects, which may cause it to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 3)]
```
This change will cause the `dispatch` method to receive three fewer arguments than it expects, which may cause it to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)]
```
This change will cause the `dispatch` method to receive only the first argument, which may cause it to fail or behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
