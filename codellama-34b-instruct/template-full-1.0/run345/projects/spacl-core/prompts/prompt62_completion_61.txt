  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props
```
This would result in different behavior because `props` is an array of strings, and `props.reverse()` would reverse the order of the elements in the array, while simply `props` would return the array itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.splice(0, props.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because `props.splice(0, props.length)` would remove all elements from the `props` array, while `props` would return the array itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `props.length` would return the number of elements in the `props` array, while `props` would return the array itself.

DONE.
