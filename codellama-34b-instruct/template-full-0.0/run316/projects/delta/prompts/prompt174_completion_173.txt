  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1, otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to move one step further than it should, potentially leading to an infinite loop or incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() - 1, otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to move one step backward than it should, potentially leading to an infinite loop or incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() * 2, otherIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to move twice as far as it should, potentially leading to an infinite loop or incorrect results.

DONE.
