  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `fail` method to handle errors, while the buggy code fragment uses the `fail` method to handle errors and also calls the `reject` method on the `deferred` object. This could cause the promise to be rejected with an error, which could affect the behavior of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).then(deferred.resolve);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `fail` method to handle errors, while the buggy code fragment uses the `then` method to handle the result of the `dispatch` method. This could cause the promise to be resolved with a different value than the original code fragment, which could affect the behavior of the program.
