  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err === false ? null : err
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `err` is `true`, while the new code fragment checks if `err` is `false`. This change would cause the function to return `null` when `err` is `false`, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

DONE.
