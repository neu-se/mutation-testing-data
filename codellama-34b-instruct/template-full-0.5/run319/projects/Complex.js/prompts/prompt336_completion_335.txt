  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if `a` is equal to 1, but the new code fragment is checking if `a` is equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if `a` is equal to 1, but the new code fragment is checking if `a` is equal to -1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if `a` is equal to 1, but the new code fragment is checking if `a` is equal to itself, which is always true.

DONE.
