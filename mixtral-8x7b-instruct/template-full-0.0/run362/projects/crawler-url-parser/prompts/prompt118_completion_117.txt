 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrl.protocol == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the protocol is null instead of checking if it is not truthy. This might pass for cases where the protocol is an empty string, which should not be allowed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrl.url === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for strict equality with null, while the original code checks if the url property is null, undefined, or an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrl.hasOwnProperty('url')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the object has the 'url' property, rather than checking if the value of the 'url' property is null. This would not catch cases where the 'url' property exists but has an incorrect value.

DONE.
