  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, data
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`. In the context of the function, `null` is indicating that there is no more data to read, while `undefined` means that there is still data to read, but the data itself is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null, null` is passing two null values to the callback, which would be interpreted as a single null value with two components.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, data
```
This would result in different behavior because `data, data` is passing the same data value to the callback twice, which would be interpreted as a single data value with two components.

DONE.
