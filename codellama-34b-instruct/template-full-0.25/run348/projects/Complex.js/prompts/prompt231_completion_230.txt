  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `sqrt` function to always return a complex number with a real part of 0 and an imaginary part equal to the square root of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `sqrt` function to always return a complex number with a real part equal to the square root of the input and an imaginary part of 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `sqrt` function to always return a complex number with a real part equal to the square root of the input and an imaginary part equal to the square root of the input.

DONE.
