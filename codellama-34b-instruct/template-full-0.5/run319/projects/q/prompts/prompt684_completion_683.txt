  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `call` method to call `array_slice` on the `arguments` object, which would result in a different value being passed to the `dispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different value to the `dispatch` method, which could cause the `Q.invoke` method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different value to the `dispatch` method, which could cause the `Q.invoke` method to behave differently.

DONE.
