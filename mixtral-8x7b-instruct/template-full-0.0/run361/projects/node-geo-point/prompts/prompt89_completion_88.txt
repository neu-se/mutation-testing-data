 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cos(distance)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Math.cos()` function on the `distance` variable instead of calculating the angular distance in radians. This change would cause the resulting `φ2` value to be incorrect, leading to inaccurate destination point calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / distance
```
This would result in different behavior because it simply inverts the `distance` value instead of calculating the angular distance in radians. This change would cause the resulting `sinδ` and `cosδ` values to be incorrect, leading to inaccurate destination point calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it generates a random number between 0 and 1 instead of calculating the angular distance in radians. This change would cause the resulting `sinδ` and `cosδ` values to be
