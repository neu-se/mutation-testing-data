  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones[name] = buildTimezone(data, "UTC");
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return the same timezone, "UTC", instead of the correct timezone for the given name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones[name] = buildTimezone(data, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return null, instead of the correct timezone for the given name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones[name] = buildTimezone(data, name.toUpperCase());
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return the timezone with the same name in uppercase, instead of the correct timezone for the given name.

DONE.
