  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.pipe(createWriteStream(dest)).on('error', reject).once('close', () => resolve({ filename: dest }));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pipe` method is not being used to pipe the response data to the write stream, which could cause the write stream to not receive all of the data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.pipe(createWriteStream(dest)).on('error', reject).once('close', () => resolve({ filename: dest }));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pipe` method is being used to pipe the response data to the write stream, but the `on` method is not being used to handle errors, which could cause the write stream to not receive all of the data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

res.pipe(createWriteStream(dest)).on('error', reject).once('close', () => resolve({ filename: dest }));
```
