  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 1, baseIndex + length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first character of the base string, potentially causing the slice to include incorrect characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex + length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include one fewer character than the original slice, potentially causing the resulting delta to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 1, baseIndex + length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the last character of the base string, potentially causing the slice to include incorrect characters.

DONE.
