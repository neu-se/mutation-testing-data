  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the string 'foo' to the value of `src`, which would change the path that is being accessed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the value of `src` to uppercase, which could change the path that is being accessed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the value of `src` on commas and return the first element of the resulting array, which could change the path that is being accessed.

DONE.
