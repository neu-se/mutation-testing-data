  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(other.ops[0]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the first operation from the `other` delta onto the `delta` object, which is not what the original code does. The original code pushes the first operation from the `other` delta onto the `delta` object only if the `other` delta has more than one operation.
