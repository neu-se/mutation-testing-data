  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because `clear()` removes all elements from the map, whereas `delete()` removes a specific element from the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set("baseUrl", null);
```
This would result in different behavior because `set()` adds or updates an element in the map, whereas `delete()` removes an element from the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.values().next().value = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the value of the first element in the map to `null`, whereas `delete()` removes an element from the map.

DONE.
