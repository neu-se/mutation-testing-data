  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This would result in different behavior because `x` and `y` are different variables in the `calculateDestination` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ
```
This would result in different behavior because `Δλ` represents the difference in longitude between the two points, while `y` represents the difference in latitude.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2
```
This would result in different behavior because `φ2` represents the latitude of the destination point, while `y` is used to calculate the difference in latitude.

DONE.
