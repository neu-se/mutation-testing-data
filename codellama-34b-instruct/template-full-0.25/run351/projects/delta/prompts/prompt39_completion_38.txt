  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the property is undefined, while this new code fragment checks if the property is not undefined. This would cause the code to behave differently in cases where the property is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the property is undefined, while this new code fragment checks if the property is null. This would cause the code to behave differently in cases where the property is null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] === undefined || a[key] === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the property is undefined, while this new code fragment checks if the property is undefined or null. This would cause the code to behave differently in cases where the property is undefined or null.

DONE.
