  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```diff
- result[country].current.push(id);
+ result[country].current = result[country].current.concat(id);
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` returns a new array, whereas `push` mutates the existing array. In this case, the `result[country]` object is mutated, which could cause issues if the object is being used in other parts of the codebase.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```diff
- result[country].current.push(id);
+ result[country].all.push(id);
```
This would result in different behavior because `result[country].all` is a nested object property, whereas `result[country].current` is a direct property of the `result` object. This could cause issues if the `all` property is being used in other parts of the codebase, as it would be overwritten by the new value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```diff
