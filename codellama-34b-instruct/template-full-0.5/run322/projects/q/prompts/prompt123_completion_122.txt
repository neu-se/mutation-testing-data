  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key of object
```
This would result in different behavior because `var key of object` is a syntax error and would cause the code to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because `object[key]` would evaluate to the value of the `key` property of the `object`, rather than the key itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys(object)` would return an array of the keys of the `object`, rather than a single key.

DONE.
