  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` is a different function that checks if an object is a promise-like object, which may have different behavior than `isPromise` when called on the same object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isPromise` is the negation of `isPromise`, which would cause the `isRejected` function to return the opposite of what it would with `isPromise`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPending
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPending` checks if a promise is in the pending state, which may not be the same as checking if it is a promise.

DONE.
