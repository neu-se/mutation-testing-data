  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter` and `otherIter` are separate iterators, so `thisIter.peekType` would be checking the type of the current operation in this iterator, rather than the other iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
transform
```
This would result in different behavior because `transform` is a method of the `Delta` class, while `peekType` is a method of the `OpIterator` class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
operations.peekType
```
This would result in different behavior because `operations` is a list of all the operations in the delta, while `peekType` is a method of the `OpIterator` class.

DONE.
