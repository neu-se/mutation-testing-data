  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` creates a shallow copy of the array, while `concat()` creates a new array by concatenating the elements of the original array with the elements of the provided array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in the array, while `concat()` concatenates the elements of the original array with the elements of the provided array in the order they appear.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` removes the last element from the array, while `concat()` concatenates the elements of the original array with the elements of the provided array without removing any elements.

DONE.
