  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the current code calculates the index of the substring in the otherOp's insert string, but adding 1 to the retain value would make it point to the next character, which may not be the case in the otherOp's insert string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.attributes.length;
```
This would result in different behavior because the current code calculates the index of the substring in the otherOp's insert string, but using the length of the otherOp's attributes object would make it point to a different location in the otherOp's insert string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain;
```
This would result in different behavior because the current code calculates the index of the substring in the otherOp's insert string, but using the retain value of the otherOp would make it point to the same location as the retain value
