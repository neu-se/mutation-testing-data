  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-sinh
```
This will negate the result of the `sinh` function, which will cause the `cos` function to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh(b) + 1
```
This will add 1 to the result of the `sinh` function, which will cause the `cos` function to return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh(b) * 2
```
This will double the result of the `sinh` function, which will cause the `cos` function to return incorrect results.

DONE.
