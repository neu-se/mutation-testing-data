  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  countries[id] = buildCountry(data, id);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `memoizeCountry` function is not being called, which means that the `countries` object is not being updated. As a result, the `getCountry` function will always return `null` when called with the same `id`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  countries[id] = buildCountry(data, id + 'a');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `id` parameter is being modified by appending the string 'a' to it. This means that the `getCountry` function will return a different result when called with the same `id`, since it is looking up a country with a different `id` in the `countries` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  countries[id] = buildCountry(data, id * 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `id
