  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'test'
```
This would result in different behavior because `embedType` is a variable that is used to determine the type of an embed operation, while `'test'` is a string literal that does not have any meaning in the context of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a special numeric value that is used to represent "not a number", and it is not a valid embed type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because `42` is a numerical value that is not a valid embed type.

DONE.
