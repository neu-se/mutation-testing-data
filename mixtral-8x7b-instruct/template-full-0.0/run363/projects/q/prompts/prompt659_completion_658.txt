 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
arguments, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fcall` method would receive only the `object` argument, and the rest of the arguments would be ignored.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a copy of the arguments array, but it would not work in older browsers that do not support the `slice` method on arrays.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1)
