  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `countryId` is a string representing a country's unique identifier. By adding `[0]`, we are now accessing the first character of the string, which could potentially result in a different country being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() * countryId.length
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `countryId` is a string representing a country's unique identifier. By calling `Math.random()`, we are generating a random number between 0 and 1, and then multiplying it by the length of the string. This would result in a different character being accessed, potentially causing a different country to be returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry(countryId.substr(1))
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `countryId` is a string representing a country's unique
