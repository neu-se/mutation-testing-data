  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisData.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisData.length` would return the length of the `thisData` object, which may not be the same as the length of the `otherData` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherData.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherData.length` would return the length of the `otherData` object, which may not be the same as the length of the `thisData` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.min(thisData.length, otherData.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.min(thisData.length, otherData.length)` would return the minimum of the lengths of the `thisData` and `otherData` objects, which may not be the same as the length of the `otherData` object.

DONE.
