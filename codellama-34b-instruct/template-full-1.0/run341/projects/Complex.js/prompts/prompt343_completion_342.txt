  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `1 + Math.cos` is not a valid operation, and the code would throw a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` returns the sine of the argument, whereas `Math.cos` returns the cosine.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(45)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin(45)` returns the sine of 45 degrees, whereas `Math.cos` returns the cosine of the argument.

DONE.
