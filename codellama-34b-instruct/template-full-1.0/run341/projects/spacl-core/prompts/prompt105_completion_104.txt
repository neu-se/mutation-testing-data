  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name + '!
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ '!'` part would be evaluated to concatenate a string with the `name` variable, resulting in a different value than just `name`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the `name` variable to uppercase, resulting in a different value than just `name`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.split(' ').join()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the `name` variable into an array of substrings using spaces as the separator, and then join them back together with no separator, resulting in a different value than just `name`.

DONE.
