  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would add an "s" to words that end in "o", while the new code fragment would add "es".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would add an "s" to words that end in "o", while the new code fragment would add "ies".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would add an "s" to words that end in "o", while the new code fragment would add "s".

DONE.
