  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
The original code fragment `defer` is a function call that returns a promise, but replacing it with `42` would cause the code to return the integer value `42` instead of a promise. This would likely result in a type error since the returned value would not have a `then` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(42)
```
The original code fragment `defer` is a function call that returns a promise, but replacing it with `Promise.resolve(42)` would cause the code to return a promise that resolves to the integer value `42`. This would likely result in different behavior since `defer` returns a promise that waits for input from the user, and `Promise.resolve` returns a promise that resolves immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(42)
```
The original code fragment `defer` is a function
