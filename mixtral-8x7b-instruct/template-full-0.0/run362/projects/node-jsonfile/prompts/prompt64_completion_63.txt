 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'ascii'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the encoding scheme used by the `toString` method, which could lead to incorrect string conversion and affect the JSON parsing in the `stringify` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'hex'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the encoding scheme used by the `toString` method, which could lead to incorrect string conversion and affect the JSON parsing in the `stringify` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` as the encoding parameter to the `toString` method would throw a `TypeError`, causing the `stripBom` function to fail.

DONE.
