 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would clear the timeout immediately, regardless of the elapsed time.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to clear an undefined variable, causing an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not clear the timeout, causing it to still fire even if the promise is resolved before the timeout.

DONE.
