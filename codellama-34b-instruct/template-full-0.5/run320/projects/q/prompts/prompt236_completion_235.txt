  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferredPromise, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferredPromise` is a different variable than `resolvedPromise`, and it may not have the same properties or methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise` is a different variable than `resolvedPromise`, and it may not have the same properties or methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promise, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolvedPromise.promise` is a different property than `resolvedPromise`, and it may not have the same properties or methods.

DONE.
