  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the peeked type is equal to 'insert', while this replacement checks if it is not equal to 'insert'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the peeked length is less than or equal to 0, while this replacement checks if it is greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the peeked length is greater than 0, while this replacement checks if it is equal to 0.

DONE.
