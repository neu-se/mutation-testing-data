 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(i)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the incremented value of `i` to the callback, while this change would pass the current value of `i` to the callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the incremented value of `i` as the second argument to the callback, while this change would pass the current value of `i` as the second argument to the callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes `true` to the callback when `i` is greater than `max`, while this change would pass `false` to the callback in the same situation.

DONE.
