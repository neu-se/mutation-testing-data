Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() > 0 ? 'insert' : 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly assumes that if there is any length available, the next operation is always an 'insert', which could lead to misinterpretation of the operation type and incorrect index calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'retain' ? 'delete' : 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the logic of operation types, treating 'retain' as 'delete' and vice versa, which would disrupt the intended transformation logic and potentially lead to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' ? 'retain' : 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to treat every 'insert' operation as a 'retain', leading to incorrect handling of operations and potentially causing the transformation logic to fail in retaining the correct data.

DONE.
