 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match()` method call on the `a` string would not return `null` but instead would throw an error if `tokens` is `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if there are no matches in the string instead of checking if the `match()` method returned `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof tokens === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `tokens` variable is not defined instead of checking if the `match()` method returned `null`.

DONE.
