  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max > 0 && any
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than `||`, so the expression would be evaluated as `(max > 0) && any`, which would always be `false` if `max` is greater than 0 and `any` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max > 0 || !any
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator has a higher precedence than `||`, so the expression would be evaluated as `(max > 0) || !any`, which would always be `true` if `max` is greater than 0 and `any` is `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max > 0 || any && max > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than `||`, so the expression would be evaluated as `(max > 0) ||
