  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset > index && priority
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nextType` check to be inverted, so the `insert` branch would be taken even if `nextType` is not equal to `insert`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType !== 'insert' || offset >= index
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `insert` branch to be taken if `nextType` is not equal to `insert`, regardless of the value of `offset`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset < index || nextType !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `insert` branch to be taken if the offset is less than the index, regardless of the value of `nextType`.

DONE.
