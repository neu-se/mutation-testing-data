  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.map
```
This would result in different behavior because `map` returns a new array with the same number of elements as the original array, whereas `filter` returns a new array with a subset of the elements of the original array that match the given predicate.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.map(function(op) { return op.retain ? op : null; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array with the same number of elements as the original array, but with null values instead of the original values for the elements that do not satisfy the predicate.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.filter(function(op) { return op.retain === undefined; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array with a subset of the elements of the original array that do not have a `retain` property.

DONE.
