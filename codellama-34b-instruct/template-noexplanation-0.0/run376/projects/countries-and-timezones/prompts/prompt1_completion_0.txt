  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!tzMap
```
This change will cause the function to return null if the `tzMap` variable is falsy, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!tzMap.current
```
This change will cause the function to return null if the `current` property of the `tzMap` object is falsy, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!tzMap.all
```
This change will cause the function to return null if the `all` property of the `tzMap` object is falsy, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
