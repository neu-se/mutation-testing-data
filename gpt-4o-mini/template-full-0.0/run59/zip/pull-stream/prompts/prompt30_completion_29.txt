Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the reference from the third argument to the second argument, potentially altering the expected input for the `pull` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[3] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the value of the third argument by adding 1, which could lead to unexpected results if the third argument is not a number or if the addition changes the intended logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the third argument with `null`, which could cause the `pull` function to behave incorrectly if it relies on the presence of a valid third argument.

DONE.
