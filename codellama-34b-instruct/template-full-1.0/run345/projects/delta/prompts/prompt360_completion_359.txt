  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.hasNext() && otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code would ignore the case where one of the iterators has no next value, causing the while loop to continue indefinitely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!thisIter.hasNext() || !otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code would ignore the case where both iterators have a next value, causing the while loop to terminate prematurely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.hasNext() !== otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code would ignore the case where both iterators have the same next value, causing the while loop to continue indefinitely.

DONE.
