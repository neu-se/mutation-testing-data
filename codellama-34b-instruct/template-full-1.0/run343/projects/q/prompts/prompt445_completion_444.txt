  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection", unhandledReasons[unhandledRejections.length], unhandledRejections[unhandledRejections.length]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the original arguments with different values from the `unhandledReasons` and `unhandledRejections` arrays, which are used to track unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled", reason, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the type of event emitted when a promise is rejected, and it would provide different arguments to the event handler.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledFulfillment", value, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the type of event emitted when a promise is fulfilled, and it would provide different arguments to the event handler.

DONE.
