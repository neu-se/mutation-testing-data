  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a specific `this` value and a bound argument list, whereas the original code simply passes the `nodeback` function as a callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` calls the `nodeback` function with a specific `this` value and a set of arguments, whereas the original code simply passes the `nodeback` function as a callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` calls the `nodeback` function with a specific `this` value and a set of arguments, whereas the original code simply passes the `nodeback` function as a callback.

DONE.
