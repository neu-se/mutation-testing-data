  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(newValue)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` is a function that expects a notification message as an argument, but `newValue` is not a notification message. Replacing `deferred.notify` with `deferred.notify(newValue)` would cause the code to fail with a `TypeError` because `newValue` is not a valid notification message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(deferred.promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.promise` is a promise object, but `deferred.notify` expects a notification message as an argument. Replacing `deferred.notify` with `deferred.notify(deferred.promise)` would cause the code to fail with a `TypeError` because `deferred.promise` is not a valid notification message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
