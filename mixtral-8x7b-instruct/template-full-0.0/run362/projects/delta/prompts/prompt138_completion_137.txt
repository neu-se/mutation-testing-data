 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' && firstLeft <= thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the order of comparison for `firstLeft` and `thisIter.peekLength()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'delete' && thisIter.peekLength() <= firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the `peekType()` condition from 'insert' to 'delete'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' && firstLeft < thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the operator from `<=` to `<` for the comparison of `firstLeft` and `thisIter.peekLength()`.

DONE.
