  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part of spec.split('/').slice(2).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice method is called with a different argument, which would cause the resulting array to have a different length and content.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part of spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the join method is called with no argument, which would cause the resulting string to be concatenated without any separator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part of spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().map(x => x.toUpperCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because the map method is called with a different function, which would cause the resulting array to have different elements.

DONE.
