  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof tz.d === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `tz.d` is a number, rather than if it is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.d !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `tz.d` is defined, rather than if it is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(tz.d || 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the value of `tz.d` if it is truthy, or 0 if it is not.

DONE.
