 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'me'
```
This would result in different behavior because the rule added for the string 'memo' is replaced with a rule for the string 'me', which would cause incorrect pluralization for the word 'memo'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/me/
```
This would result in different behavior because the rule added for the string 'memo' is replaced with a regular expression that matches the string 'me', which would cause incorrect pluralization for the word 'memo' and also incorrectly match and apply to any words containing 'me'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w + 'a' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function added for the string 'memo' is replaced with a function that appends the letter 'a' to the input word, which would cause incorrect pluralization for the word 'memo' and any other words that should form their plural by
