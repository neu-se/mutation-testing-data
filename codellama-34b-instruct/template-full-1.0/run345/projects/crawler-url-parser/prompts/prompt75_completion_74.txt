  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `<base>` would select the `base` element of the page, while the replacement code fragment `''` would select nothing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'sect'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `<base>` would select the `base` element of the page, while the replacement code fragment `'sect'` would select the `sect` element of the page.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'.default'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `<base>` would select the `base` element of the page, while the replacement code fragment `'.default'` would select the `default` class of the page.

DONE.
