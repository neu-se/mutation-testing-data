  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated
```
This change will cause the `deliverCountry` function to return a different value for the `timezones` property, which may cause tests that rely on this property to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.timezones
```
This change will cause the `deliverTimezones` function to return a different value for the `timezones` property, which may cause tests that rely on this property to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.countries
```
This change will cause the `getCountriesForTimezone` function to return a different value for the `countries` property, which may cause tests that rely on this property to fail.

DONE.
