 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFulfilled` function would always return true, regardless of the input's promise status.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFulfilled` function would return false for any input that is a promise, even if it's fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFulfilled` function would always return the value of the `this` keyword, instead of checking the promise status.

DONE.
