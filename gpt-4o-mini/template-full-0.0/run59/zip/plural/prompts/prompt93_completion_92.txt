Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'child', 'children'
```
This would result in different behavior because the pluralization of "child" to "children" is an irregular plural form, which does not follow the same pattern as "chilli" to "chillies".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chilli', 'chillieses'
```
This would result in different behavior because "chillieses" is not a valid plural form of "chilli", as the correct plural is "chillies", thus causing incorrect pluralization.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chilli', 'chillie'
```
This would result in different behavior because "chillie" is a misspelling and does not represent the correct plural form of "chilli", which should be "chillies".

DONE.
