  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type !== 'Point'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `type` property of the `point` object is not equal to `'Point'`, which is the opposite of the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `point` object does not have a `coordinates` property, which is different from the original code fragment that checks if the `point` object has a `coordinates` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length !== 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the length of the `coordinates` property of the `point` object is not equal to 2, which is different from the original code fragment that checks if the length is equal to 2.

DONE.
