 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates an empty object instead of using the `cloneDeep` function to create a deep copy of `newOp`. This could cause issues if `newOp` contains nested objects or arrays, as changes to the original object would not be reflected in the empty object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
lastOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `lastOp` variable instead of `newOp`. This could cause issues if `lastOp` and `newOp` have different properties or values, as the code would be modifying the wrong object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops[index] = newOp;
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly assigns `newOp` to the `index` position in the `ops` array, instead of using `splice` to insert it at the correct position. This could cause issues if
