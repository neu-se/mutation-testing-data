  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject, deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the rejected promise would not be passed to the deferred's `reject` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.resolve);
```
This would result in different behavior because the fulfilled promise would be passed to the deferred's `resolve` method instead of the `reject` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).fail(function() {});
```
This would result in different behavior because a new function would be passed to the `fail` method instead of the deferred's `reject` method.

DONE.
