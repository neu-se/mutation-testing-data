  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.+\/$/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match` method would return `null` instead of a non-null value, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` instead of `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.+\/$/) !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match` method would return `undefined` instead of a non-null value, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` instead of `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.+\/$/) !== spec.match(/^.+$/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match` method would return a different value for the same input, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` instead of `false`.

DONE.
