  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end` is a boolean value that indicates whether the stream has ended, while `null` is a null value that does not have this meaning. This change would cause the code to behave differently in the case where the stream has ended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a value that indicates that a variable or property has not been defined, while `end` is a boolean value that indicates whether the stream has ended. This change would cause the code to behave differently in the case where the stream has ended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because `true` is a boolean value that indicates that the stream has ended, while `end` is a boolean value that indicates whether the stream has ended. This change would cause the code to behave differently in the case where the stream has ended.

DONE.
