  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name
```
This would result in different behavior because `policy.name` is a string, while `policy` is an object. This would cause the `set` method to throw an error, as it expects a `Policy` object as the second argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `policy.name.toLowerCase()` is a string, while `policy` is an object. This would cause the `set` method to throw an error, as it expects a `Policy` object as the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `policy.name.toUpperCase()` is a string, while `policy` is an object. This would cause the `set` method to throw an error, as it expects a `Policy` object as the second argument.

DONE.
