  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('cello', 'cello')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a new rule to the list of rules, while the modified code fragment adds a rule that is already present in the list, which would not change the behavior of the program.

DONE.
