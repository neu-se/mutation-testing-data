  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([.$])/g, '\\$2'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string now references the second capture group, which does not exist in the regular expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([.$])/g, '\\$1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string now references the first capture group, which does not exist in the regular expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([.$])/g, '\\$0'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string now references the entire match, which does not exist in the regular expression.

DONE.
