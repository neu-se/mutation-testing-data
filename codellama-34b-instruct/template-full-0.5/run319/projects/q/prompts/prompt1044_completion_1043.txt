  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get("tail").fail
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is called on the `promise` object, which is not the same as the `promise` object returned by the `get` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get("tail").then
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the `promise` object, which is not the same as the `promise` object returned by the `get` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get("tail").catch
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch` method is called on the `promise` object, which is not the same as the `promise` object returned by the `get` method.

DONE.
