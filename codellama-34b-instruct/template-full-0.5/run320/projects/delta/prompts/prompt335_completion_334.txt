  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes, baseOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `AttributeMap.invert` function to be called with the wrong number of arguments, which would likely cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes, baseOp.attributes,
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `AttributeMap.invert` function to be called with an extra argument, which would likely cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

DONE.
