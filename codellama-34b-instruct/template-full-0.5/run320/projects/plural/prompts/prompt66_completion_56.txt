  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('memo', 'memo')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code adds the plural form of the word "memo" as "memos", while this modified code would return the same word "memo".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('memo', 'memos')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code adds the plural form of the word "memo" as "memos", while this modified code would return the same word "memos".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('memo', 'memus')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code adds the plural form of the word "memo" as "memos", while this modified code would return a different plural form "memus".

DONE.
