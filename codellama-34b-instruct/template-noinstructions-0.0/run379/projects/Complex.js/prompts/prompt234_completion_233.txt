  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is less than or equal to 0, while this new code fragment only checks if `a` is less than 0. This means that if `a` is equal to 0, the original code fragment would return `true`, while this new code fragment would return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a != 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is less than or equal to 0, while this new code fragment checks if `a` is not equal to 0. This means that if `a` is equal to 0, the original code fragment would return `true`, while this new code fragment would return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is less than or equal to
