  Sure, I can help you with that! Here are three possible options for mutating the code:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(this['re'] + 1, this['im'] + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operation would always add one to the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, regardless of whether the division resulted in an integer or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(this['re'] * 2, this['im'] * 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operation would always double the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, regardless of whether the division resulted in an integer or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(this['re'] / 2, this['im'] / 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `/ 2` operation would always halve the
