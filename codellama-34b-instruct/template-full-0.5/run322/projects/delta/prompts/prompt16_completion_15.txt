  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof b !== 'object'` checks if `b` is not an object, while `b === undefined` checks if `b` is undefined. If `b` is undefined, the first condition would evaluate to `true`, while the second condition would evaluate to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b != null
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof b !== 'object'` checks if `b` is not an object, while `b != null` checks if `b` is not null or undefined. If `b` is null or undefined, the first condition would evaluate to `true`, while the second condition would evaluate to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b instanceof Object
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof b !== 'object'` checks if `b` is not an object, while `b instanceof Object` checks if `b` is an instance of the
