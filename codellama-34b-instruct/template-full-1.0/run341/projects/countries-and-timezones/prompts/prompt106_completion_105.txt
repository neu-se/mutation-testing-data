  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country == null
```
This would result in different behavior because `country == null` checks for `null` or `undefined` values, while `!country` only checks for falsy values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `country.length === 0` checks for an empty string, while `!country` checks for falsy values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country.countryId === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `country.countryId === null` checks for a `null` value for the `countryId` property, while `!country` checks for falsy values.

DONE.
