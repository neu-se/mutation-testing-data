 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would call the function directly instead of posting a message to it. This could cause issues if the function being called is asynchronous and expects to be called with a Node.js-style callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, nodeArgs, deferred.resolve]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` function would be passed as an argument to the function being called, which is not the case in the original code. This could cause the function to behave unexpectedly, or it could cause an error if the function is not expecting an additional argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would use the `apply` method to call the function, which would pass the `node
