 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` is the correct way to calculate the cosine of a number in JavaScript, while `cos` is a reference to a local variable or function that might not be defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / x
```
This would result in different behavior because this expression calculates the reciprocal of `x`, not the cosine of `x`. This would produce incorrect results in the `calculateBearing` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` generates a random number between 0 and 1, not the cosine of a number. This would produce incorrect results in the `calculateBearing` method.

DONE.
