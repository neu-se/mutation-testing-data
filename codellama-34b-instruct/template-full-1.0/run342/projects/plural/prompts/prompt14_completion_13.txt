  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because `word.substr(1, w.length - 1)` would return the substring starting from index 1 instead of from the beginning of the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because `word.substr(0, w.length - 1)` would return the substring starting from index 0 to the second-to-last character of the word, whereas `word.substr(-1, w.length - 1)` would return the substring starting from the last character of the word to the second-to-last character, effectively removing the last character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `word.substr(0, w.length - 1)` would return the substring starting from index 0 to the last character of the word, whereas `word.substr(w.length - 2
