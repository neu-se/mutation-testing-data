  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
7
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method would be called with the wrong index, causing the resulting string to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
9
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method would be called with the wrong index, causing the resulting string to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method would be called with a negative index, causing an error to be thrown.

DONE.
