Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.split('//')[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly remove the protocol from the URL instead of replacing it with 'http://', potentially leading to malformed URLs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/\/\//, 'https://')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the protocol with 'https://' instead of 'http://', which may not be the intended behavior for URLs that should default to 'http'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/\/\//, 'ftp://')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the protocol to 'ftp://' instead of 'http://', which is inappropriate for most web URLs and could lead to errors in URL parsing.

DONE.
