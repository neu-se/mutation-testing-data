  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is the logical NOT operator, and it inverts the result of the expression. In the original code, the `ended` variable is only checked if it is truthy, but with the `!` operator, the `ended` variable is checked if it is falsy. This can cause the function to return different results, depending on the initial value of `ended`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is the logical AND operator, and it checks both expressions and returns the second expression if the first expression is truthy. In the original code, the `ended` variable is only checked if it is truthy, but with the `&&` operator, the `cb` function is only called if both the `ended` variable and the `cb` function are truthy. This can cause the function to return different results, depending on the initial values of `ended` and `cb`.
