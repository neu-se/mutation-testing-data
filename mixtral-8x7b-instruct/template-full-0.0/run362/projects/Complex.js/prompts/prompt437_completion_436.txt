 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use 1 as the power for the places argument, instead of the original code which uses 10 to the power of the places argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.pow(2, places || 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use 2 as the base for the power operation instead of 10, which could lead to unexpected results in the rounding operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
places || 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not perform any power operation, and would always use the original places value or 0, which could lead to incorrect rounding results.

DONE.
