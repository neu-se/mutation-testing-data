  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src + 'foo'
```
This code fragment will concatenate the string 'foo' to the end of the src variable, which will likely cause the access() function to fail, as the resulting path will not exist.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.substring(1)
```
This code fragment will remove the first character of the src variable, which will likely cause the access() function to fail, as the resulting path will not exist.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.toUpperCase()
```
This code fragment will convert the src variable to uppercase, which will likely cause the access() function to fail, as the resulting path will not exist.

DONE.
