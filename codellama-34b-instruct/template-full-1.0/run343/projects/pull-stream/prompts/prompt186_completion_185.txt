  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i+1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the next element in the array, rather than the current element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i-1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the previous element in the array, rather than the current element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
randomNumber()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a random number, rather than the current element in the array.

DONE.
