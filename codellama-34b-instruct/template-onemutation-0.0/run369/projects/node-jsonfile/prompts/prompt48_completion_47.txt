  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `str` is a string, while `null` is a null value. The `stringify` function would produce different output for these two values, leading to a different behavior in the `writeFileSync` function.

DONE.
