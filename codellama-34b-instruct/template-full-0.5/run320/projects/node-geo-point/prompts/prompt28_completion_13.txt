  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by 2 would cause the angle to be doubled, which would change the direction of the bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad - 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 180 would cause the angle to be inverted, which would change the direction of the bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad + 90
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 90 would cause the angle to be rotated by 90 degrees, which would change the direction of the bearing.

DONE.
