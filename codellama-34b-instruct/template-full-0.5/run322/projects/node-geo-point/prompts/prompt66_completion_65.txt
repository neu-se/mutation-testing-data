  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(y, x)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan2` is a function that returns the arctangent of the quotient of its arguments, whereas `atan2` is a variable that is not defined in the code snippet.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan(y / x)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan` is a function that returns the arctangent of its argument, whereas `atan2` is a function that returns the arctangent of the quotient of its arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan(y * x)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan` is a function that returns the arctangent of its argument, whereas `atan2` is a function that returns the arctangent of the quotient of its arguments.

DONE.
