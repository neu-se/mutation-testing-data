  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the `Math.abs(<PLACEHOLDER>)` expression always evaluate to `0`, causing the `if` statement to always execute the `return Complex['NAN']` branch, even if the input is valid.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c * c
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the `Math.abs(<PLACEHOLDER>)` expression always evaluate to `c^2`, causing the `if` statement to always execute the `return Complex['NAN']` branch, even if the input is valid.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * c
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the `Math.abs(<PLACEHOLDER>)` expression always evaluate to `a * c`, causing the `if` statement to always execute the `return Complex['NAN']` branch, even if
