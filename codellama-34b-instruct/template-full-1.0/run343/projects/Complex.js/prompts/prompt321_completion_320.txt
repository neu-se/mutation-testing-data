  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the original function uses `Math.cos` to calculate the secant, but replacing it with `Math.sin` would cause the function to calculate the sine instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because the original function uses `Math.cos` to calculate the secant, but replacing it with `Math.abs` would cause the function to calculate the absolute value of the input instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because the original function uses `Math.cos` to calculate the secant, but replacing it with `Math.floor` would cause the function to round the input down to the nearest integer instead.

DONE.
