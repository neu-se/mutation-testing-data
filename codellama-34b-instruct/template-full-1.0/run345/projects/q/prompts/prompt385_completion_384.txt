  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the fulfilled promise value, but `undefined` would cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the fulfilled promise value, but throwing an error would cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"something else"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the fulfilled promise value, but `"something else"` would change the return value of the function.

DONE.
