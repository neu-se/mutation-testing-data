  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return promise.inspect();
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.inspect()` would return the state of the promise, but `regardless` is a function that returns the promise itself, which is not the same behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return promise.then(noop, noop);
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.then(noop, noop)` would return a new promise that resolves with the value of the original promise, but `regardless` is a function that returns the promise itself, which is not the same behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return promise.then(noop, function () {});
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.then(noop, function () {})` would return a new promise that resolves with the value of the original promise, but `regardless` is a function that returns the promise itself,
