  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\r\n", EOL
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the global flag `g` to replace all occurrences of `\n` with `EOL`, while this replacement only replaces the first occurrence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"[^\n]+", EOL
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the dot character `.` to match any character except for a newline, while this replacement uses a character class `[^\n]` to match any character except for a newline.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
EOL, EOL
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a different value for `EOL` than the replacement.

DONE.
