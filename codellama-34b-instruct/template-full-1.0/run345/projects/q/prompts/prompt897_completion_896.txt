  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had a bug that would cause the promise to never be resolved or rejected in certain cases. The fixed code fragment would ensure that the promise is always resolved or rejected, which would change the behavior of the function in those cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had a bug that would cause the promise to never be rejected in certain cases. The fixed code fragment would ensure that the promise is always rejected, which would change the behavior of the function in those cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify("done");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had a bug that would cause the promise to never be notified in certain cases. The fixed code fragment would ensure that the promise is always notified, which would change the behavior of the function in those
