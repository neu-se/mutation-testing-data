  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing would be offset by 180 degrees, which could cause the destination point to be calculated incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing would be doubled, which could cause the destination point to be calculated incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing - 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing would be offset by -180 degrees, which could cause the destination point to be calculated incorrectly.

DONE.
