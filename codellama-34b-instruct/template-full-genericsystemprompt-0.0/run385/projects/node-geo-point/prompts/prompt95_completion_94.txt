  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the sine of the wrong latitude value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosφ2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the cosine of the wrong latitude value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ1 * cosφ2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the sine of the wrong latitude value and then multiply it by the cosine of the wrong latitude value.

DONE.
