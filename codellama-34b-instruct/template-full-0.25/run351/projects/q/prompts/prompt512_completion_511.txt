  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_values
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_values` returns an array of the values in the object, while `object_keys` returns an array of the keys in the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_entries` returns an array of the key-value pairs in the object, while `object_keys` returns an array of the keys in the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values()` returns an array of the values in the object, while `object_keys` returns an array of the keys in the object.

DONE.
