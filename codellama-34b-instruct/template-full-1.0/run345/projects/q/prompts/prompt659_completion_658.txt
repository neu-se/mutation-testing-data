  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.wait
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.wait` is a reserved method in the Q library and is used to wait for a promise to be fulfilled. Using it in place of `arguments, 2` would cause the function to wait for the second argument passed to `Q.dispatch`, instead of slicing the array of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.concurrent
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.concurrent` is a reserved method in the Q library and is used to execute an array of promises concurrently. Using it in place of `arguments, 2` would cause the function to execute a subset of promises concurrently, instead of slicing the array of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fapply
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fapply` is a reserved method in the Q library and is used to apply a function in a future turn. Using it
