  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(deferred.promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` expects an error object as its first argument, but `deferred.promise` is a promise object, which would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(deferred.promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` expects a value as its first argument, but `deferred.promise` is a promise object, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the promise object itself, rather than the value it represents.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(deferred.promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver` expects a function as its first argument, but `deferred.promise` is a promise object, which would cause an error to be thrown.
