  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `next` method to return a different value, potentially leading to incorrect results in the subsequent code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(<PLACEHOLDER> + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `next` method to return a different value, potentially leading to incorrect results in the subsequent code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(<PLACEHOLDER> - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `next` method to return a different value, potentially leading to incorrect results in the subsequent code.

DONE.
