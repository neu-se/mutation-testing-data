  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nfapply(FS.readFile, [__filename])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nfapply` is a different function than `Q`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nfcall(FS.readFile, [__filename])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nfcall` is a different function than `Q`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nfbind(FS.readFile, [__filename])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nfbind` is a different function than `Q`.

DONE.
