  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i++)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the callback function with the wrong arguments. The original code calls the callback function with the first argument set to `null`, but this change would call it with the first argument set to `i++`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the callback function with the wrong arguments. The original code calls the callback function with the second argument set to `i++`, which increments the value of `i` by 1, but this change would call it with the second argument set to `0`, which would not increment the value of `i`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the callback function with the wrong arguments. The original code calls the callback function with the second argument set to `
