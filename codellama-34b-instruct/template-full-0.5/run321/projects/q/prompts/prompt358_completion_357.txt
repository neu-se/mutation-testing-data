  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressed.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `progressed.bind(null)` would return a new function that is bound to `null` as its `this` value, whereas `progressed` would return the original function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressed.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `progressed.bind(this)` would return a new function that is bound to `this` as its `this` value, whereas `progressed` would return the original function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressed.bind(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `progressed.bind(undefined)` would return a new function that is bound to `undefined` as its `this` value, whereas `progressed` would return the original function.

DONE.
