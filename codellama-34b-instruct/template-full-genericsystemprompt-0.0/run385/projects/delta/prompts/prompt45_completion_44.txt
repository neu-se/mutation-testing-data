  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof b !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true` when `b` is an object, even if `b` is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false` when `b` is an object, even if `b` is null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true` when `b` is an object, even if `b` is null.

DONE.
