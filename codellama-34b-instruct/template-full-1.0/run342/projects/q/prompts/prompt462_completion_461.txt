  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return array_lastIndexOf(reportedUnhandledRejections, promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_lastIndexOf` function returns the index of the last occurrence of the specified value in the array, rather than the index of the first occurrence as returned by `array_indexOf`. This would mean that if `promise` occurs multiple times in `reportedUnhandledRejections`, only the last occurrence would be removed by the `array_lastIndexOf` function, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return array_includes(reportedUnhandledRejections, promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_includes` function returns a boolean indicating whether the specified value is present in the array, rather than the index of the first occurrence as returned by `array_indexOf`. This would mean that if `promise` occurs multiple times in `reportedUnhandledRejections`, the function would always return `false`, even if `prom
