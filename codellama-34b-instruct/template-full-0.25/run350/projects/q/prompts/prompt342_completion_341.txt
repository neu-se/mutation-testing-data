  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(fulfilled(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfilled` is a function that returns a promise, so `deferred.resolve` would be called with a promise instead of a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(rejected(exception));
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejected` is a function that returns a promise, so `deferred.resolve` would be called with a promise instead of a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would be called instead of `deferred.resolve`, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

DONE.
