  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the imaginary part of the complex number instead of the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['abs']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the absolute value of the complex number instead of the real part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['arg']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the argument (angle in radians) of the complex number instead of the real part.

DONE.
