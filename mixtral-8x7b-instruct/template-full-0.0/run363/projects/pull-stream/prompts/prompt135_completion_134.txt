 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.exit(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the script would immediately exit with a non-zero status code, rather than calling the callback function `cb`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.error(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the error would be logged to the console, but the callback function `cb` would not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(() => cb(err), 1000)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function `cb` would be called with the error after a delay of 1 second, rather than being called synchronously.

DONE.
