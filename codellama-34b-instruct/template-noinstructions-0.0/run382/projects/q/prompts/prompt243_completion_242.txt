  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if `resolvedPromise` is not `undefined`, even if the promise is not yet resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `true` if `resolvedPromise` is `true`, not if it is any other truthy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `true` if `resolvedPromise` is `false`, not if it is any other falsy value.

DONE.
