  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.denodeify.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a method on functions, and it would call the function with the given context and arguments. In this case, it would not return a promise, which would cause the code that expects a promise to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.denodeify.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` is a method on functions, and it would return a new function that is bound to the given context and arguments. In this case, it would return a function that returns a promise, which is not what the code expects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.denodeify.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` is a method on functions, and it would call the function with the given context and arguments as an array. In this case, it would not return a promise, which would cause the code that expects a promise to fail
