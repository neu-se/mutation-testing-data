  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r > 1 ? 0 : r
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return 1 if r is greater than 1, but the new code fragment would return 0 instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r > 1 ? r : 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return 1 if r is greater than 1, but the new code fragment would return 0 instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r > 1 ? r : r + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return 1 if r is greater than 1, but the new code fragment would return r + 1 instead.

DONE.
