  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` signal would be ignored, and the stream would continue to read data even if an abort signal was received.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would not be called with the `err` parameter, and the stream would not be able to report errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, function(err) { cb(err); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called with the `err` parameter, but the `abort` signal would still be ignored.

DONE.
