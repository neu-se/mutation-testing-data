  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split("at ")[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first occurrence of "at " in the stack trace, which may not be the function call that caused the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split("at ")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the last occurrence of "at " in the stack trace, which may not be the function call that caused the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split("at ").slice(-2)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider the second-to-last occurrence of "at " in the stack trace, which may be the function call that caused the error.

DONE.
