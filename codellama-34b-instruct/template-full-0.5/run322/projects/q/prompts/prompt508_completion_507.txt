  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a method that calls a function with a given this value and arguments provided individually, while `apply` is a method that calls a function with a given this value and arguments provided as an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` is a method that creates a new function that, when called, has its this keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.toString
```
This would result in different behavior because `toString` is a method that returns a string representing the object, while `apply` and `call` are methods that invoke a function.

DONE.
