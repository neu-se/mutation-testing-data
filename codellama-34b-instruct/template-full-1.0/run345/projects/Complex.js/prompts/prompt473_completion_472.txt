  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` function expects a real number, not an imaginary number, as its argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(this['re'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` function expects a real number, not a square root of a real number, as its argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex['I']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` function expects a real number, not a complex number, as its argument.

DONE.
