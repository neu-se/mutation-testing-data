Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(`Failed to parse row: ${row}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the variable `row` instead of `rowStr`, which may not provide the correct context of the original string that caused the error, potentially leading to confusion about what data was corrupted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(`Could not load corrupted row: ${rowStr.toUpperCase()}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it transforms `rowStr` to uppercase, which changes the content of the error message, potentially making it less informative or misleading about the nature of the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(`Row data is invalid: ${JSON.stringify(rowStr)}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `JSON.stringify(rowStr)` instead of the original message, which may not accurately reflect the nature of the error and could lead to a more complex error message that obscures the original issue.

DONE.
