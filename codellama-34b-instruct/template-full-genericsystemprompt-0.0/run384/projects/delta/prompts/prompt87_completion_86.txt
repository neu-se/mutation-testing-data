  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the attributes of the last operation to the current operation, rather than merging them as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = { ...lastOp.attributes, ...newOp.attributes }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would merge the attributes of the last operation with the current operation, but it would also overwrite any conflicting attributes in the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = { ...newOp.attributes, ...lastOp.attributes }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would merge the attributes of the current operation with the last operation, but it would also overwrite any conflicting attributes in the last operation.

DONE.
