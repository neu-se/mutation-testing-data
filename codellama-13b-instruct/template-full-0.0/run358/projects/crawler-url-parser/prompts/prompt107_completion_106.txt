  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the URL to lowercase, which could affect the comparison with other URLs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the URL to uppercase, which could affect the comparison with other URLs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url.replace(/^https?:\/\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace()` method would remove the "http" or "https" protocol from the URL, which could affect the comparison with other URLs.

DONE.
