  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(end === true ? null : end)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `===` operator to check for equality, while the new code fragment uses the `==` operator. This could cause the function to behave differently in certain edge cases, such as when `end` is a boolean value.

DONE.
