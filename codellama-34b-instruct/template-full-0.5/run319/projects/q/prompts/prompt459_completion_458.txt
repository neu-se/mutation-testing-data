  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.slice(), promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new array instead of modifying the existing one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.concat(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the promise to the end of the array instead of removing it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.splice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first element of the array instead of the last one.

DONE.
