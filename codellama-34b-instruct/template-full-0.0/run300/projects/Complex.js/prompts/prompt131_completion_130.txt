  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the result of `this['isInfinite']`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when the original code would have evaluated to `false`, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` is the opposite of `isInfinite`, so the `if` statement would evaluate to `true` when the original code would have evaluated to `false`, and vice versa.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` checks if a value is not a number, while `isInfinite` checks if a value is infinite. The `if` statement would evaluate to `true` when the original code would have evaluated to `false`, and vice versa.
