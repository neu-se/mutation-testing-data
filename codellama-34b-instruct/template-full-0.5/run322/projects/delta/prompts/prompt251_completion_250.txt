  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const opLength = Math.min(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the way the `opLength` variable is calculated, potentially leading to different results in the `diffResult.forEach` loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const opLength = Math.max(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the way the `opLength` variable is calculated, potentially leading to different results in the `diffResult.forEach` loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const opLength = thisIter.peekLength() + otherIter.peekLength();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the way the `opLength` variable is calculated, potentially leading to different results in the `diffResult.forEach` loop.

DONE.
