  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(reject(undefined))
```
This would result in different behavior because a rejected promise with no reason would be created, rather than a rejected promise with the given reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(fulfill(undefined))
```
This would result in different behavior because a fulfilled promise with no value would be created, rather than a rejected promise with the given reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(Q(reason))
```
This would result in different behavior because a new promise would be created from the reason, rather than a rejected promise with the given reason.

DONE.
