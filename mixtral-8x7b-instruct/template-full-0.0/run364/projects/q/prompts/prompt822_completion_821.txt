Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```javascript
function() { return "I'm not a promise"; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method expects a promise as an argument, and a function that returns a string is not a promise. This would cause the `then` method chained after `Q(<PLACE
