  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve` returns a resolved promise, while `Promise.reject` returns a rejected promise. This means that the code that handles the promise returned by `image` would be executed, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(new Error('something went wrong'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise returned by `image` to be rejected with a specific error message, which could be handled differently by the code that calls `image`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(new Error('something went wrong'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise returned by `image` to be rejected with a specific error message, which could be handled differently by the code that calls `image`.

DONE.
