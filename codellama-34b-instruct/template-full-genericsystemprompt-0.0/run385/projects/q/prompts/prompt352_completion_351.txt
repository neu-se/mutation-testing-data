  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw exception
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would have returned a rejected promise, while the new code fragment would throw an exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return resolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would have returned a rejected promise, while the new code fragment would return a resolved promise with the same value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(new Error("Rejected"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would have returned a rejected promise with the original exception, while the new code fragment would return a rejected promise with a new error message.

DONE.
