  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!point.hasOwnProperty('type') || !point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `point` object has both the `type` and `coordinates` properties, while this new code fragment checks if the `point` object does not have either of those properties. This would cause the `fromGeoJSON` method to throw an error if the `point` object has either of those properties, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type === 'Point'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `point` object has a `type` property with the value `'Point'`, while this new code fragment checks if the `point` object has a `type` property with any value other than `'Point'`. This would cause the `fromGeoJSON` method to throw an error if the `point` object has a `type` property with the value `'
