  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would not be called with the expected arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be called with the error argument instead of the data argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be called with the data argument instead of the error argument.

DONE.
