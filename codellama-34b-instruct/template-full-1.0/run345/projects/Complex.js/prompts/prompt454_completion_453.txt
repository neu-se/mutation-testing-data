  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the result of `isNaN`, causing the method to return `false` when the actual result should be `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` would return `false` when the complex number is at the zero pole or infinity pole of the Riemann sphere, while `isNaN` would return `true` in both cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] > this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the real part of the complex number to its imaginary part, while `isNaN` checks for the presence of `NaN` in both parts.

DONE.
