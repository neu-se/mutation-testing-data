  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self[op].apply(self, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `self[op]` would refer to the `op` property of `self`, which is not necessarily the same as the `op` parameter passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.op.apply(self, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `self.op` would refer to the `op` property of `self`, which is not necessarily the same as the `op` parameter passed to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.op(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `self.op` would refer to the `op` method of `self`, which is not necessarily the same as the `op` parameter passed to the function.

DONE.
