  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite` checks if the complex number is infinite, while `isZero` checks if it is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === 0 && this['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the real and imaginary parts of the complex number are both zero, while `isZero` checks if the complex number is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] < 0 || this['im'] < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the real or imaginary part of the complex number is negative, while `isZero` checks if the complex number is zero.

DONE.
