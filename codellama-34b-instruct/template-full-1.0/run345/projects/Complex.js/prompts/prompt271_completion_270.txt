  Option 1:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because math.atan2 is used

Option 2:
```
Math.sin(this.re, this.im)
```
This would result in different behavior because Math.sin takes only one argument

Option 3:
```
Math.tan(this.im, this.re)
```
This would result in different behavior because Math.tan takes only one argument
