  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using `a`, which is a variable. In this alternative, we are using `-a`, which is the negative of `a`. This will cause the result of the operation to be multiplied by -1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using `a`, which is a variable. In this alternative, we are using `a + 1`, which would add 1 to the value of `a`, resulting in a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using `a`, which is a variable. In this alternative, we are using `a + b`, which would add the value of `b` to the value of `a`, resulting in a different result.

DONE.
