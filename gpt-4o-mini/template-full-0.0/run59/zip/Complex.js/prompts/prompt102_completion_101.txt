Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '+' : '') + c
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the sign of the number being parsed from negative to positive when `minus` is odd, which could lead to incorrect results when interpreting complex numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(c)
```
This would result in different behavior because it takes the absolute value of `c`, ignoring its sign entirely, which would lead to incorrect parsing of the real part of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-parseFloat(c)
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the parsed value to be negative regardless of the original value of `c`, which could lead to incorrect results when adding or subtracting complex numbers.

DONE.
