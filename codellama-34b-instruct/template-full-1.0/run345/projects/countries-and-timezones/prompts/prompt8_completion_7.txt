  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.timezones.slice(0, 10)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return a subset of the total timezones, which could cause errors in the buildCountry function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.timezones.filter(tz => tz.country === "USA")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return timezones that match a specific country, which could cause errors in the buildCountry function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.timezones.map(tz => tz.id)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return an array of timezone IDs, which could cause errors in the buildCountry function.

DONE.
