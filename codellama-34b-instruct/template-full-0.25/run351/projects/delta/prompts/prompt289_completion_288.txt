  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip over the next two elements in the iteration, potentially causing the code to miss important information or behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.previous()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would move the iteration backward, potentially causing the code to process the same element multiple times or miss important information.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.reset()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reset the iteration to the beginning, potentially causing the code to process the same elements multiple times or miss important information.

DONE.
