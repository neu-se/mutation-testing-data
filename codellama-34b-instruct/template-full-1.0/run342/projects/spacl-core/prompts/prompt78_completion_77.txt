  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const rule of this.rules.readOnly()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prevent the policy from being modified and so the "push" and "clone" methods would not work.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const rule of this.rules.pop()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first element of the "rules" array each time the loop is executed, which would cause the "query" method to not check all the rules.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const rule of this.rules.sample()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check a randomly selected element of the "rules" array each time the loop is executed, which would not cover the entire policy.

DONE.
