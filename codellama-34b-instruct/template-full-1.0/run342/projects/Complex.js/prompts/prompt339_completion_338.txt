  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0 || b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` and `b` are both 0, while the new code fragment checks if either `a` or `b` is not 0. This change would cause the `return` statement to be executed even if `a` and `b` are both 0, which could result in unexpected behavior in the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0 && b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` and `b` are both 0, while the new code fragment checks if both `a` and `b` are not 0. This change would cause the `return` statement to be skipped if either `a` or `b` is 0, which could result in unexpected behavior in the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0 ||
