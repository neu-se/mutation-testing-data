  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is not defined in the current scope, and the `call` method would throw a `TypeError` exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method would throw a `TypeError` exception when trying to call `undefined` or `null` as a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method would throw a `TypeError` exception when trying to call an object as a function.

DONE.
