  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next
```
This would result in different behavior because the `otherIter` iterator is not being used in the original code, while the `thisIter` iterator is being used. By replacing `thisIter` with `otherIter`, the code would be using a different iterator, which could potentially lead to different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(other.ops[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `other` delta is being used instead of `this` delta. By pushing `other.ops[0]` to `delta`, the code would be using a different delta, which could potentially lead to different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.concat(other)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retDelta` delta is being concatenated with `other`, which could potentially lead to different behavior than concatenating `this` with `other`.

DONE.
