  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.toLowerCase();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would return a new string with all characters in lower case, whereas the original code fragment using `replace` would not modify the input string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.substring(0, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring(0,0)` method would return an empty string, whereas the original code fragment using `replace` would not modify the input string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.split();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method would split the input string into an array of substrings, whereas the original code fragment using `replace` would not modify the input string.

DONE.
