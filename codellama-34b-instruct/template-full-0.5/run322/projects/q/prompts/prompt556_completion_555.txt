  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value, callback, errback
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `all` method to be called on the `result.value` property instead of the `result` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result, callback, errback
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `all` method to be called on the `result` object without any arguments, which would likely result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value.all(callback, errback)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `all` method to be called on the `result.value` property with the `callback` and `errback` arguments, which would likely result in an error.

DONE.
