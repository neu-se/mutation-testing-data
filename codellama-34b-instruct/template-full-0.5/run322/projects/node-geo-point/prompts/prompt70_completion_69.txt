  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(θ / 2) + 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the bearing in degrees, but the replaced code fragment calculates the bearing in radians.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(θ * 2) + 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the bearing in degrees, but the replaced code fragment calculates the bearing in radians.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(θ + 360) % 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the bearing in degrees, but the replaced code fragment calculates the bearing in radians and then takes the modulo 180.

DONE.
