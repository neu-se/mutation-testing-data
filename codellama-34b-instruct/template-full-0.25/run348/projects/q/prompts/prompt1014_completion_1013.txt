  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method expects a function as its argument, but `null` is being passed instead. This would cause the `nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver())` line to throw an error, which would result in the promise being rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method expects a function as its argument, but an empty function is being passed instead. This would cause the `nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver())` line to push a function onto the `nodeArgs` array, which would result in the promise being resolved with a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(deferred.makeNodeResolver())
```
This would result in
