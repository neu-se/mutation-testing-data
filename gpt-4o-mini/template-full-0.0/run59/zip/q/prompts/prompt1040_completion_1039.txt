Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately resolve the promise with the provided value instead of creating a new deferred promise, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the queue's handling of values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("Queue error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with an error instead of deferring it, causing the queue to fail immediately when trying to put a value, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set `next` to `null`, leading to a situation where `next.promise` is undefined, which would cause runtime errors when trying to access properties on `next` later in the code.

DONE.
