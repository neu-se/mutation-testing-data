  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, "wrong name"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would try to retrieve the timezone with the name "wrong name" instead of the correct name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.timezones[0], name
```
This would result in different behavior because it would try to retrieve the first timezone in the list instead of the correct timezone.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, name
```
This would result in different behavior because it would try to retrieve the timezone from a null object instead of the correct object.

DONE.
