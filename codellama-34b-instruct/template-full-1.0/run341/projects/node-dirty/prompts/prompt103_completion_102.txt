  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val
```
This would result in different behavior because `row.val` is undefined, whereas `row.key` is a defined property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row['key']
```
This would result in different behavior because `row['key']` is a different syntax for accessing the `key` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete a different key-value pair from the `this._data` object.

DONE.
