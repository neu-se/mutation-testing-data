  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete || op.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider a string value for the `retain` property as a deletion, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete || op.retain === 'number' && op.retain > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider positive numbers for the `retain` property as a deletion, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete || op.retain === 'number' && op.retain < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider negative numbers for the `retain` property as a deletion, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
