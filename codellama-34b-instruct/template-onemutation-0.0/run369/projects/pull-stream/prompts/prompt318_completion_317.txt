  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `cb` function with the `data` argument, while the new code fragment calls it with both `null` and `data` arguments. This could potentially cause the test suite to pass even if the `take` function is not working correctly.

DONE.
