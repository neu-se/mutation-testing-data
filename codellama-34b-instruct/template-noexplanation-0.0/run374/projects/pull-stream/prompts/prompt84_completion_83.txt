  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This change will cause the `read` function to be called with `null` as the first argument, which will likely cause an error or unexpected behavior in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This change will cause the `read` function to be called with `undefined` as the first argument, which may cause the code to behave differently than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This change will cause the `read` function to be called with `true` as the first argument, which may cause the code to behave differently than expected.

DONE.
