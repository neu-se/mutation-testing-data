  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl, parsedUrl.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pathname` property is not included in the original code fragment, which would cause the `URL.resolve` method to use the `href` property instead, which could result in a different URL being resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl, parsedUrl.search
```
This would result in different behavior because the `search` property is not included in the original code fragment, which would cause the `URL.resolve` method to use the `href` property instead, which could result in a different URL being resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl, parsedUrl.hash
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hash` property is not included in the original code fragment, which would cause the `URL.resolve` method to use the `href` property instead, which could result in a different URL being resolved.
