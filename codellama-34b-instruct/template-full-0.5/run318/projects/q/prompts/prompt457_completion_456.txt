  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` creates a shallow copy of the array, which means that the original array is not modified when the copy is modified. In the original code, `unhandledRejections` is modified when `untrackRejection()` is called, which could affect the behavior of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.splice(0, unhandledRejections.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice()` modifies the original array, which means that the array is cleared when `untrackRejection()` is called. In the original code, `unhandledRejections` is not modified when `untrackRejection()` is called, which could affect the behavior of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` removes the
