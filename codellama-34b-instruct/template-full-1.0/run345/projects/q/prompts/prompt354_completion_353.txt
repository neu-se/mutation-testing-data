  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function is not called, which would prevent the promise from being rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function is called instead of the `fulfilled` function, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error instead of returning a promise, which would cause the promise to be rejected.

DONE.
