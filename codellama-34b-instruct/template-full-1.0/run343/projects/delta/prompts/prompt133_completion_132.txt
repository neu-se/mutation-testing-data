  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `Op.length` returns the length of the operation, while `Op.length - 1` would return the length minus one, which could cause the algorithm to skip over certain operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `Op.length` returns the length of the operation, while `Op.length + 1` would return the length plus one, which could cause the algorithm to include extra operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(Op.length / 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Op.length / 2` would return the half length of the operation, while `Math.floor(Op.length / 2)` would round down to the nearest integer, which could cause the algorithm to truncate or round down certain operations.

DONE.
