 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.index >= this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the index is at the end of the array instead of checking if there is a next operation with `hasNext()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.offset === Op.length(this.ops[this.index])
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the offset has reached the end of the current operation instead of checking if there is a next operation with `hasNext()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the type of the current operation instead of checking if there is a next operation with `hasNext()`.

DONE.
