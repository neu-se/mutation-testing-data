  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flush` function would be called with a different argument, which could cause it to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush, 1000
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flush` function would be called with a different argument, which could cause it to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush, -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flush` function would be called with a different argument, which could cause it to behave differently.

DONE.
