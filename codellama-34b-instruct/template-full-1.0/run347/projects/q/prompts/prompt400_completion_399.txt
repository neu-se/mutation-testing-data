  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"a string"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is
different. "a string" is a string primitive and does not have the same
behavior as a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because 0 is a number primitive and
does not have the same behavior as a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => null
```
This would result in different behavior because () => null is a function and
does not have the same behavior as a promise.

DONE.
