 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(abort || true, done || function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` function is replaced with a direct call to `read`, which may cause the function to terminate prematurely and not process all data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op && op(data) || read(abort || true, done || function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the order of operations, potentially causing the `read` function to be called before the `op` function, which could lead to data being processed out of order or skipped entirely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort = true
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the `abort` variable to `true` unconditionally, causing the function to terminate immediately and potentially skipping processing of remaining data.

DONE.
