  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops !== other.ops
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the comparison, causing the `invert` method to return a delta that is the opposite of the original delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length !== other.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the length of the two ops arrays, rather than the arrays themselves. This would cause the `invert` method to return a delta that is the opposite of the original delta if the two arrays have different lengths.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length === other.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the length of the two ops arrays, rather than the arrays themselves. This would cause the `invert` method to return a delta that is the same as the original delta if the two arrays have the same length.

DONE.
