Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `undefined` instead of the `exception` would mean that any error thrown during the promise execution would not be captured, leading to unhandled promise rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Error occurred"
```
This would result in different behavior because returning a string message instead of the actual `exception` would obscure the original error details, making debugging more difficult and potentially leading to misleading error handling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `null` instead of the `exception` would indicate that no error occurred, which could lead to incorrect assumptions about the success of the promise operation, allowing the program to continue executing as if everything was fine.

DONE.
