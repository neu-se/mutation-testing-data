  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the latitude and longitude values in the calculation of the great-circle distance between the two points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad + 0.001
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a small deviation to the longitude value of the second point, causing a difference in the calculated distance between the two points.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pi = 3;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of pi to a value of 3, which would cause a significant deviation in the calculated distance between the two points.

DONE.
