  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Something went wrong");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws an exception if the generator throws an error, but this code fragment would always throw an error regardless of whether the generator throws an error or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw exception;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws an exception if the generator throws an error, but this code fragment would always throw an exception regardless of whether the generator throws an error or not.

```

DONE.
