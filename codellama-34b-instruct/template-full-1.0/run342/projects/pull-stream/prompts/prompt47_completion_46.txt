  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never be entered when the length of `arguments` is 0 or negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would be entered one extra time when the length of `arguments` is 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would exit one iteration earlier when the length of `arguments` is 1.

DONE.
