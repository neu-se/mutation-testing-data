  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\$2'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match the second capture group instead of the first.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\$0'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match the entire match instead of the first capture group.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\$1'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match the first capture group instead of the entire match.

DONE.
