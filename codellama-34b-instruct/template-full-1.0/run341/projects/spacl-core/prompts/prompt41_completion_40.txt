  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not escape the forward slash, which is a special character in regular expressions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would escape the forward slash, which is not necessary in this context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'//'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any sequence of characters that starts with a forward slash.

DONE.
