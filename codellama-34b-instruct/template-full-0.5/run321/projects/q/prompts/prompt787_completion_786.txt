  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected immediately, rather than waiting for the promise to be fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled immediately, rather than waiting for the promise to be fulfilled or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.then()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled or rejected after a delay, rather than immediately.

DONE.
