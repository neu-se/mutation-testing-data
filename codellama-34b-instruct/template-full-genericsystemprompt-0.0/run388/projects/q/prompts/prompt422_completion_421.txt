  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the fulfillment value of the promise, rather than the promise itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().reason
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the rejection reason of the promise, rather than the promise itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the state of the promise, rather than the promise itself.

DONE.
