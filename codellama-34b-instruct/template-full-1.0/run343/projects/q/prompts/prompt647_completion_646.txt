  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post1"
```
This would result in different behavior because "post1" is not a valid property name for the object returned by `Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, args])`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args
```
This would result in different behavior because `args` is not a valid property name for the object returned by `Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, args])`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name
```
This would result in different behavior because `name` is not a valid property name for the object returned by `Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, args])`.

DONE.
