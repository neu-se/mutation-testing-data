  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType
```
This change will cause the `compose` method to use the `peekType` method of the `otherIter` iterator instead of the `thisIter` iterator, which may result in different behavior if the two iterators have different types of operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength
```
This change will cause the `compose` method to use the `peekLength` method of the `thisIter` iterator instead of the `peekType` method, which may result in different behavior if the two iterators have different lengths of operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength
```
This change will cause the `compose` method to use the `peekLength` method of the `otherIter` iterator instead of the `peekType` method, which may result in different behavior if the two iterators have different lengths of operations.

DONE.
