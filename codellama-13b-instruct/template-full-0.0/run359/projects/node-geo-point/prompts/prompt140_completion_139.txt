  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the longitude value is being used instead of the latitude value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the longitude value is being incremented by 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the longitude value is being decremented by 1.

DONE.
