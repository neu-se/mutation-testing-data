  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"wasFlipped"
```
This would result in different behavior because "wasFlipped" is not a valid property of the Complex class, and would cause the code to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"flipped"
```
This would result in different behavior because "flipped" is not a valid property of the Complex class, and would cause the code to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"add"
```
This would result in different behavior because "add" is a valid method of the Complex class, and would cause the code to add two complex numbers instead of checking if a complex number is NaN.

DONE.
