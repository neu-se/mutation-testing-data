  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value.then()
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.value` is a promise, and calling `then()` on it would return a new promise that resolves to the value of the original promise, rather than the value itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value.catch()
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.value` is a promise, and calling `catch()` on it would return a new promise that resolves to the value of the original promise if it is fulfilled, or the reason for rejection if it is rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value.finally()
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.value` is a promise, and calling `finally()` on it would return a new promise that resolves to the value of the original promise, regardless of whether it is fulfilled or rejected.

DONE.
