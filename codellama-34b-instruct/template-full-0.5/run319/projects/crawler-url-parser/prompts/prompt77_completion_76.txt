  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedBaseUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'http://');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only replaces the protocol if it is not already present, while this code fragment always adds the protocol, potentially changing the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedBaseUrlStr.replace(/^\/\//, 'http://');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only replaces the protocol if it is not already present, while this code fragment always replaces the protocol with "http://", potentially changing the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedBaseUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, '');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only replaces the protocol if it is not already present, while this code fragment always removes the protocol, potentially changing the URL.

DONE.
