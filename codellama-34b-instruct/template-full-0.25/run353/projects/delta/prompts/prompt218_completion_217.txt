  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would result in the concatenation of the entire `other.ops` array, while the new code fragment would result in the concatenation of all but the last element of the `other.ops` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would result in the concatenation of the entire `other.ops` array, while the new code fragment would result in the concatenation of all but the first element of the `other.ops` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would result in the concatenation of the entire `other.ops` array, while the new code fragment would result in the concatenation of all but the last element of the `other.ops
