  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("Q can't get fulfillment value from any promise, all promises were rejected."))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `any` function to always reject with an error message, regardless of whether any of the promises in the input array are fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(result)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `any` function to always resolve with the fulfillment value of the first promise in the input array, regardless of whether any of the other promises are fulfilled or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(promise, onFulfilled, onRejected, onProgress)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `any` function to always wait for the first promise in the input array to settle, regardless of whether any of the other promises are fulfilled or
