  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is not defined in the function, so it would return `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because `b[key]` is not defined in the function, so it would return `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because `a[key]` is not defined in the function, so it would return `undefined`.

DONE.
