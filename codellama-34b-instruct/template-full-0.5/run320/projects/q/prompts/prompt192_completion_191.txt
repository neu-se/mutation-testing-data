  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the uppercase version of the stack line, which may not match the expected result of the `isInternalFrame` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split(":")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the first part of the stack line, separated by the colon character, which may not match the expected result of the `isInternalFrame` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.replace(":", "")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove all colon characters from the stack line, which may not match the expected result of the `isInternalFrame` function.

DONE.
