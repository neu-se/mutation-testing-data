  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.message, self
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the message property of the exception object instead of the exception object itself, which could potentially change the behavior of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.stack, self
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the stack property of the exception object instead of the exception object itself, which could potentially change the behavior of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.toString(), self
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the string representation of the exception object instead of the exception object itself, which could potentially change the behavior of the program.

DONE.
