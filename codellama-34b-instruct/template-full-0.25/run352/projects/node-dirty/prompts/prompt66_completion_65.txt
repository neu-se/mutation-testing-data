  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(() => {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `destroy` method on the `_writeStream`, which would close the stream immediately, while the new code fragment calls the `end` method with an empty callback, which would wait for all data to be written to the stream before closing it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy(new Error('Test error'));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not pass any arguments to the `destroy` method, while the new code fragment passes an error object, which would cause the stream to be closed with an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(() => {
  throw new Error('Test error');
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not throw any errors, while the new code fragment throws an error inside the callback function, which would
