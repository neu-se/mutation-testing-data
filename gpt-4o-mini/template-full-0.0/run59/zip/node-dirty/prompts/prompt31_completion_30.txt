Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, null, cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the value associated with the key to `null` instead of deleting the key from the `_data` map, which changes the intended functionality of the `rm` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(key, val, cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly calls `this.set` with `val` (which is `undefined`), leading to the key being retained in the `_data` map instead of being removed, thus not achieving the intended removal of the key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete(key);
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly deletes the key from `_data` without invoking the callback `cb`, which means that the callback will not be executed to signal that the operation is complete, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the application.

DONE.
