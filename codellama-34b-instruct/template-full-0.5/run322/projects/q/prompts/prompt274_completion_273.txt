  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always reject the promise with the error object, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!error
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always resolve the promise with the input value, regardless of whether it is an error object or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.message
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always resolve the promise with the message property of the error object, regardless of whether it is an error object or not.

DONE.
