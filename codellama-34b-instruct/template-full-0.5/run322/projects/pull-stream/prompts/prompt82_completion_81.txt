  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function is called with the `abort` argument, which is not the intended behavior. The original code fragment `read` is called without any arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function is called without any arguments, which is not the intended behavior. The original code fragment `read` is called with the `abort` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function is called with the `null` argument, which is not the intended behavior. The original code fragment `read` is called with the `abort` argument.

DONE.
