  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.search.split("=")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the search query into an array of key-value pairs, whereas the original code fragment only splits the search query into a single array of strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.search.split("&")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the search query into an array of strings, where each string represents a single query parameter, whereas the original code fragment splits the search query into an array of key-value pairs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.search.split("?")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the search query into an array of strings, where each string represents a single query parameter, whereas the original code fragment splits the search query into an array of key-value pairs.

DONE.
