  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function would return a country object even if it's already cached.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] && countries[id].timezones
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function would only return a country object if it has any timezones.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] || buildCountry(data, id)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function would build a new country object if it's not already cached.

DONE.
