  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-y
```
This would result in different behavior because the angle phi is now calculated using the imaginary part of the complex number instead of the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-(Math.PI / 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the angle phi is now calculated using half of pi instead of the original angle.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(b, a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the angle phi is now calculated using the arctangent function instead of the original formula.

DONE.
