  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse` method with the `false` value for the `slashesDenoteHost` parameter would not treat the first segment of the URL as a host.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse` method with the `false` value for the `search` parameter would not parse the query string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse` method with the `true` value for the `query` parameter would parse the query string and return the result as an object.

DONE.
