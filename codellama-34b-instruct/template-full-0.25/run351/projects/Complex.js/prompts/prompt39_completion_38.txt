  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.log` function to calculate the logarithm of the sum of the squares of `a` and `b`, while this replacement code fragment multiplies `a` and `b` directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.log` function to calculate the logarithm of the sum of the squares of `a` and `b`, while this replacement code fragment divides `a` by `b` directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.log` function to calculate the logarithm of the sum of the squares of `a` and `b`, while this replacement code fragment adds `a` and `b` directly.

DONE.
