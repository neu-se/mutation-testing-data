  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(b, a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments to `Math.atan2` are swapped, which would cause the resulting angle to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(a, b) + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting angle would be offset by 180 degrees, which would cause the complex number to be rotated by 180 degrees.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(a, b) - Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting angle would be offset by -180 degrees, which would cause the complex number to be rotated by -180 degrees.

DONE.
