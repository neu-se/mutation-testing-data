  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return baseIndex + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was `return baseIndex + length;`, which would return the correct index after the operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return baseIndex - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was `return baseIndex + length;`, which would return the correct index after the operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return baseIndex + 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was `return baseIndex + length;`, which would return the correct index after the operation.

DONE.
