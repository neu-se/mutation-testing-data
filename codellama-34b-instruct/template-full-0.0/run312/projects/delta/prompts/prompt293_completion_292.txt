  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `line.delete` would delete the entire line, whereas `line.push` would only push the current operation to the line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `line.retain` would retain the entire line, whereas `line.push` would only push the current operation to the line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `line.insert` would insert a new line, whereas `line.push` would only push the current operation to the line.

DONE.
