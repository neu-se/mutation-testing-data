  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op].apply(promise, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `apply` method on the `descriptor` object, which is not defined in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op].call(promise, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `call` method on the `descriptor` object, which is not defined in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op].bind(promise, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `bind` method on the `descriptor` object, which is not defined in the original code.

DONE.
