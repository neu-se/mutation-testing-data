  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(key) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value stored at the given key, while this modified code fragment returns the value stored at the given key plus 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(key) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value stored at the given key, while this modified code fragment returns the value stored at the given key minus 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(key) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value stored at the given key, while this modified code fragment returns the value stored at the given key multiplied by 2.

DONE.
