  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'base' + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string, while the replaced code fragment is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'base' + '1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string, while the replaced code fragment is a concatenation of two strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'base' + 'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string, while the replaced code fragment is a concatenation of two strings, one of which is a number.

DONE.
