  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb
```
This would result in different behavior because `abortCb` is a function that takes an argument, but `cb` is a function that takes no arguments. In the original code, `cb` is called with no arguments, but if `abortCb` is used instead, it will be called with an argument, which could cause a type error or other unexpected behavior.
