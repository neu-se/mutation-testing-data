  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(Math.abs(z['im'] - this['im']) - Complex['EPSILON']) <= Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `equals` method to always return `true` for complex numbers with an imaginary part within `Complex['EPSILON']` of the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(z['im'] - this['im']) <= Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `equals` method to always return `true` for complex numbers with an imaginary part within `Complex['EPSILON']` of the real part, regardless of whether the real part is also within `Complex['EPSILON']` of the real part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(z['im'] - this['im']) <= 0.
