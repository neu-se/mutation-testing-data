  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, but the replacement code fragment is a string literal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void task
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, but the replacement code fragment is an expression statement with the same result as the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, but the replacement code fragment is a different expression.

DONE.
