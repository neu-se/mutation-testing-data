  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_keys` function would return the keys of the object, but with an offset of 1. This would cause the function to return incorrect results, and could potentially cause errors in the code that uses the `array_keys` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_keys` function would return the keys of the object, but with an offset of -1. This would cause the function to return incorrect results, and could potentially cause errors in the code that uses the `array_keys` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_keys` function would return the keys of the object, but with a multiplication factor of 2. This would cause the function to return incorrect results, and could potentially cause errors in the code that uses the `array
