  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new GeoPoint(0, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the same point, regardless of the input coordinates, instead of calculating the destination point based on the input coordinates and the distance and bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new GeoPoint(this.longitude, this.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a point with the same coordinates as the input point, instead of calculating the destination point based on the distance and bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new GeoPoint(Math.random() * 180, Math.random() * 360)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a random point within the bounds of the latitude and longitude, instead of calculating the destination point based on the input coordinates and the distance and bearing.

DONE.
