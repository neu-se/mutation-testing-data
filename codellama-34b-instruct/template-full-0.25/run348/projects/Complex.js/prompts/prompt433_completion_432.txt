  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the real part of the complex number by the number of places, instead of the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] / places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would divide the imaginary part of the complex number by the number of places, instead of multiplying it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + this['im'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the real part of the complex number to the product of the imaginary part and the number of places, instead of just multiplying the imaginary part.

DONE.
