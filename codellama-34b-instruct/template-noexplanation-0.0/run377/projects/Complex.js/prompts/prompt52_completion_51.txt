  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg'] + 1
```
This change will cause the `Math.log` function to return a different value, which may affect the overall result of the `logHypot` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg'] - 1
```
This change will also cause the `Math.log` function to return a different value, which may affect the overall result of the `logHypot` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg'] * 2
```
This change will cause the `Math.log` function to return a different value, which may affect the overall result of the `logHypot` function.

DONE.
