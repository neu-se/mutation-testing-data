  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would evaluate to `false` instead of `true`, and the `else` block would be executed instead of the `if` block.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would evaluate to `true` instead of `false`, and the `if` block would be executed instead of the `else` block.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would evaluate to `true` instead of `false`, and the `if` block would be executed instead of the `else` block.

DONE.
