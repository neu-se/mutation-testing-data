  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split("\n")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first line of the stack trace, which may not contain the desired information.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split("\n").reverse()[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider the last line of the stack trace, which may not contain the desired information.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split("\n").slice(1).join("\n")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider all lines of the stack trace except the first one, which may not contain the desired information.

DONE.
