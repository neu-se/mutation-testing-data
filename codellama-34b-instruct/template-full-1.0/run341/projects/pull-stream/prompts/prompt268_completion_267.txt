  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a function to be passed to `cb`, but `null` is not a function and will cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a function to be passed to `cb`, but `undefined` is not a function and will cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a function to be passed to `cb`, but `read` is a function that takes two arguments, and will cause an error when called with one argument.

DONE.
