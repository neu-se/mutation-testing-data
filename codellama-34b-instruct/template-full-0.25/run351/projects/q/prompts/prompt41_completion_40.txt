  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush()
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush()` is a function that is already defined in the code, and calling it again would cause an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush(1)` is a function call with a different argument than the original `flush()` call, and it would cause the `flush` function to be called with a different argument, which could potentially change the behavior of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush.call(null)` is a function call with a different `this` context than the original `flush()` call, and it could potentially change the behavior of the program.

DONE.
