  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `while` loop to continue even if the `otherIter` iterator has reached the end of the `other` Delta's operations, which could lead to an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `while` loop to exit immediately if the `delta` Delta has no operations, which would prevent any further processing of the `other` Delta's operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i >= delta.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `while` loop to exit immediately if the `i` index has reached the end of the `delta` Delta's operations, which would prevent any further processing of the `other` Delta's operations.

DONE.
