  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb in verbs
```
This would result in different behavior because it would loop through the indices of the `verbs` array, rather than the elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb of Object.keys(verbs)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would loop through the keys of the `verbs` object, rather than the elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would randomly generate a number for each iteration, rather than using the actual elements of the `verbs` array.

DONE.
