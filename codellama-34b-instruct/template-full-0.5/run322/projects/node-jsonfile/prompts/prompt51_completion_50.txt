  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(obj, replacer, spaces)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `JSON.stringify` method with the `replacer` and `spaces` arguments, which are not present in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(obj, null, spaces)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `JSON.stringify` method with a `null` replacer function, which would result in the stringified object being returned without any modifications.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(obj, replacer, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `JSON.stringify` method with a `null` spaces argument, which would result in the stringified object being returned without any indentation.

DONE.
