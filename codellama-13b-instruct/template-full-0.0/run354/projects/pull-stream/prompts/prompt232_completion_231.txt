  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end && test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function is called with the same argument as the `read` function, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && !test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function is called with the opposite argument as the `read` function, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end && !test(data) && !read(end, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function is called with the same argument as the `test` function, which could lead to unexpected results.

DONE.
