 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript

```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider any `otherOp` with a non-null `retain` property as a "retain" operation, even if it's not a number. This could lead to incorrect composition of operations.

```typescript
typeof otherOp.retain !== 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider any `otherOp` with a defined `retain` property as a "retain" operation, even if it's not a number. This could lead to incorrect composition of operations.
