  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastOp.delete` is always equal to `typeof newOp.delete === 'number'`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastOp.attributes` is always equal to `typeof newOp.attributes === 'object'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the current instance of the class, which is different from `lastOp`.

DONE.
