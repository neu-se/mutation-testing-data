  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This change will cause the `isInfinite` method to be called instead of the `isNaN` method, which could potentially cause the `isInfinite` method to return a different value than it would have if the original code had been executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This change will cause the `isFinite` method to be called instead of the `isNaN` method, which could potentially cause the `isFinite` method to return a different value than it would have if the original code had been executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']
```
This change will cause the `isZero` method to be called instead of the `isNaN` method, which could potentially cause the `isZero` method to return a different value than it would have if the original code had been executed.

DONE.
