  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b*b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the expression, potentially causing the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b + c
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an additional term to the expression, potentially changing the result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2*a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the value of the variable `a` in the expression, potentially changing the result of the calculation.

DONE.
