  Sure, I can help you with that! Here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different behavior than the original code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` will reject the promise with an error, whereas `deferred.resolve` will resolve the promise with a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.promise.then(() => {
    throw new Error("Some custom error");
})
```

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.promise.then(() => {
    return;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new promise that resolves with `undefined` when it is fulfilled, whereas the original code
