  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pathname.split('/').pop()
```
This code fragment will return the last segment of the pathname, which may not be the same as the basename of the file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pathname.split('/').shift()
```
This code fragment will return the first segment of the pathname, which may not be the same as the basename of the file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pathname.split('/').slice(-2).join('/')
```
This code fragment will return the last two segments of the pathname, which may not be the same as the basename of the file.

DONE.
