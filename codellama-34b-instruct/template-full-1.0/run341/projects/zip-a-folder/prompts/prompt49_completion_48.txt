  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
< 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison operator would be reversed, allowing the code to pass even if the compression level is greater than 9.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof o.compression === "string";
```
This would result in different behavior because the compression level would always be considered a string, even if it's a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!o.compression;
```
This would result in different behavior because the compression level would always be considered as not being defined, even if it's defined as a number.

DONE.
