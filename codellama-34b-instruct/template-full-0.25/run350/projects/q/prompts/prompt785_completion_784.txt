  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("rejected")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a new error object, rather than the original rejection reason.

DONE.
