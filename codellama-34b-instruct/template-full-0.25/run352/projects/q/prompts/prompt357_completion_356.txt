  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function is not called with the expected `exception` argument, which could cause the promise to be resolved instead of rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function is not called with any argument, which could cause the promise to be resolved instead of rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function is not called at all, and instead an error is thrown, which could cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

DONE.
