  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasNext` is a method that checks if there is a next element in the iterator, whereas `iter.hasNext` would be a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `next` is a method that returns the next element in the iterator, whereas `iter.next` would be a syntax error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek` is a method that returns the next element in the iterator without advancing it, whereas `iter.peek` would be a syntax error.

DONE.
