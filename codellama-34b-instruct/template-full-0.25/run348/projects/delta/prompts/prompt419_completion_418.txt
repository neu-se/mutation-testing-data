  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType !== 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next type is 'delete', while this replacement checks if it is not 'delete'. This would cause the code to behave differently in cases where the next type is not 'delete', which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next type is 'delete', while this replacement checks if it is 'retain'. This would cause the code to behave differently in cases where the next type is 'retain', which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next type is 'delete', while this replacement checks if it is 'insert'. This would cause the code to behave differently in cases where the next type is 'insert', which
