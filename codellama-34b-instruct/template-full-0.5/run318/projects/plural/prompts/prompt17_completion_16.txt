  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/x$|ch$|s$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now matching "x" or "ch" or "s" at the end of the word, instead of just "x" or "ch" or "s" alone.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/x$|ch$|s$/i, function(
