  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify` method would be called with `null` as the argument, which would not trigger any progress notifications.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify` method would be called with `undefined` as the argument, which would not trigger any progress notifications.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify` method would be called with `0` as the argument, which would trigger a progress notification with a value of `0`.

DONE.
