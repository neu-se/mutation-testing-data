Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!node.isFile()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the node is not a file instead of checking if it's a directory, potentially allowing files to be opened with flags that are not intended for files.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
node.isSymbolicLink()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the node is a symbolic link instead of a directory, which could lead to incorrect error handling for symbolic links.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
flagsNum === FLAGS.w
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the flags used to open the file instead of the node type, potentially allowing directories to be opened for writing if the write flag is set.

DONE.
