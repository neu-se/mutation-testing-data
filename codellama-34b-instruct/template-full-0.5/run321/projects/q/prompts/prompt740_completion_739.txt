  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `allResolved` function to return a promise that is already rejected, rather than a promise that is resolved with an array of promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `allResolved` function to return a promise that is resolved with `undefined`, rather than a promise that is resolved with an array of promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `allResolved` function to return a promise that is resolved with the value `true`, rather than a promise that is resolved with an array of promises.

DONE.
