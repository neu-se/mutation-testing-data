  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would decrement `i` instead of incrementing it, which could cause the function to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max++
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment `max`, which could cause the function to return incorrect results if `max` is used as a boundary condition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reset `i` to 0, which could cause the function to return incorrect results if `i` is used as a counter.

DONE.
