  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true` if `row.val` is not `undefined`, even if it is `null` or `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val == undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true` if `row.val` is `undefined`, even if it is `null` or `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof row.val === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true` if `row.val` is `undefined`, even if it is `null` or `false`.

DONE.
