  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { throw new Error(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would throw an error, causing the program to crash, rather than returning a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return 42; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the value 42, rather than the value returned by the original function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return undefined, rather than the value returned by the original function.

DONE.
