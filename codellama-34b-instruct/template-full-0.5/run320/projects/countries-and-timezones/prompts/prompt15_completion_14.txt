  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.r !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `tz.r` is undefined, while this new code fragment checks if it is not undefined. This change would cause the code to execute the `if` block if `tz.r` is not undefined, which may produce different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.r === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `tz.r` is undefined, while this new code fragment checks if it is null. This change would cause the code to execute the `if` block if `tz.r` is null, which may produce different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!tz.r
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `tz.r` is undefined, while this new code fragment checks if it is falsey. This change would cause the code to execute the `if` block
