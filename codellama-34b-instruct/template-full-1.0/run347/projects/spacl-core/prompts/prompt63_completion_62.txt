  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push(`/${part.replace(/([^/])/g, '\\/$1')}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement pattern now uses $1 instead of $0, which would cause the regex to match a different subset of strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push(`/${part.replace(/([^/])/g, '\\$1')}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement pattern now uses $1 instead of $0, which would cause the regex to match a different subset of strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push(`/${part.replace(/\$/g, '\\$')}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement pattern now escapes $ with \\$ instead of replacing it with \\/, which would cause the regex to match a different subset of strings.

DONE.
