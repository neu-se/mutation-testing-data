  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.test
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.test` is a different method than `path.match`, and it may not return the same result for the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.split` returns an array of substrings, whereas `path.match` returns a `Matcher` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.replace
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.replace` returns a new string with the specified replacement, whereas `path.match` returns a `Matcher` object.

DONE.
