  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is not being called on the correct object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).fail(deferred.resolve);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is being called with the wrong argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).fail(function() {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is being called with a different function.

DONE.
