  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing calculation would use the latitude of the starting point instead of the ending point, which would result in an incorrect bearing value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing calculation would use the longitude of the ending point instead of the starting point, which would result in an incorrect bearing value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing calculation would use the longitude of the starting point instead of the ending point, which would result in an incorrect bearing value.

DONE.
