  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op === { delete: length }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, even if the `op` object has a different structure than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete === length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `true` if the `op` object has a `delete` property with the same value as `length`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete === op.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `true` if the `op` object has both a `delete` property and a `length` property, and those properties have the same value.

DONE.
