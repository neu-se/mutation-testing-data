  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function is not being called with the correct arguments. The `abortCb` function expects three arguments: `cb`, `abort`, and `onAbort`, but in the original code, only two arguments are being passed: `cb` and `abort`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument is being passed to the `abortCb` function, which may cause it to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the extra argument being passed to the `abortCb` function is a boolean value, which may cause it to behave differently than if it were a
