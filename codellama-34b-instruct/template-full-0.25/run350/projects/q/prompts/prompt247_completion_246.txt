  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first character of the stack trace, which could potentially change the line number that is displayed in the stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.substring(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first two characters of the stack trace, which could potentially change the line number and column number that are displayed in the stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.substring(3)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first three characters of the stack trace, which could potentially change the line number, column number, and function name that are displayed in the stack trace.

DONE.
