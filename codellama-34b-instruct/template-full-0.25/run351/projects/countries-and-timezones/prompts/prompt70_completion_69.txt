  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeTimezone(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `memoizeTimezone` function would be called with a null argument, which would cause it to return null, rather than the expected timezone object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeTimezone(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `memoizeTimezone` function would be called with an undefined argument, which would cause it to return undefined, rather than the expected timezone object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeTimezone(timezones[name]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `memoizeTimezone` function would be called with a timezone object that is already memoized, which would cause it to return the memoized object, rather than the expected timezone object.

DONE.
