 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.constants.F_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.constants.F_OK` checks if the file exists, regardless of permissions, instead of checking if the file is readable and writable as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.constants.R_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because only the read permission is checked, while the original code checks for both read and write permissions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because only the write permission is checked, while the original code checks for both read and write permissions.

By changing the permissions check, you can expose potential issues in the test suite regarding file access and handling of permission errors. DONE.
