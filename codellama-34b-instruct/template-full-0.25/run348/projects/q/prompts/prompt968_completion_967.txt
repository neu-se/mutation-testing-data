  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function and would cause a `TypeError` when invoked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function and would cause a `TypeError` when invoked.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo", args
```
This would result in different behavior because `"foo"` is not a function and would cause a `TypeError` when invoked.

DONE.
