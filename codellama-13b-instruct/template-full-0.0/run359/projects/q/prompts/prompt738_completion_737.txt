  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` function would return a rejected promise if any of the promises in the array are rejected, whereas the original code would return a fulfilled promise with the values of the fulfilled promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` function would return a fulfilled promise with the values of the fulfilled promises, whereas the original code would return a rejected promise if any of the promises in the array are rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` function would return a fulfilled promise with the values of the fulfilled promises, whereas the original code would return a rejected promise if any of the promises in the array are rejected.

DONE.
