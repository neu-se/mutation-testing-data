  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` checks if a value is present in a string, while `indexOf` checks if a value is present in an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` extracts a section of a string, while `indexOf` checks if a value is present in an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert.split
```
This would result in different behavior because `split` splits a string into an array of substrings, while `indexOf` checks if a value is present in an array.

DONE.
