  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"tail"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return the `tail` property of the `ends.promise` object, which is not the same as the `head` property that was originally returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"head.tail"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return the `tail` property of the `head` object, which is not the same as the `head` property that was originally returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"head.tail.head"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return the `head` property of the `tail` object, which is not the same as the `head` property that was originally returned.

DONE.
