Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the variable used in the calculation from the real part `a` to the imaginary part `b`, which will yield incorrect results for the complex hyperbolic cosine function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the real part `a`, which alters the input to the `cosh` function, leading to an incorrect calculation of the complex hyperbolic cosine.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the square of the real part `a` instead of `a`, which will significantly change the output of the `cosh` function, as it will no longer reflect the original input value.

DONE.
