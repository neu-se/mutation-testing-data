  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filterNot
```
This would result in different behavior because `filterNot` is a different function than `filter`, and it is not clear what the intention of the developer was when using `filterNot` in this context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filter.not
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter.not` is a different method than `filter`, and it is not clear what the intention of the developer was when using `filter.not` in this context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `!filter` is a different operation than `filter`, and it is not clear what the intention of the developer was when using `!filter` in this context.

DONE.
