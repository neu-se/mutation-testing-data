Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
l
```
This would result in different behavior because the `l` variable holds the left index of the current partition, whereas the original `indices[l]` code fragment uses the value at the `l` index in the `indices` array, which is a calculated quantile index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
indices[r]
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the rightmost index of the current partition, instead of the left index from the `indices` array, potentially altering the quantile selection process.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
m
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the middle index of the current partition, which could lead to incorrect ordering and thus incorrect quantile calculation, as opposed to using the pre-calculated quantile index from the `indices` array.

DONE.
