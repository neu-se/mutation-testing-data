  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because the concatenation operation would be skipped, and the resulting string would be a single space rather than a newline character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "
```
This would result in different behavior because the concatenation operation would be skipped, and the resulting string would be two spaces rather than a newline character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\t"
```
This would result in different behavior because the concatenation operation would be skipped, and the resulting string would be a tab character rather than a newline character.

DONE.
