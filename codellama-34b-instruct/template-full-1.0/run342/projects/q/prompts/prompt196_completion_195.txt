  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var index = stackLine.lastIndexOf(":")
var fileNameAndLineNumber = [stackLine.substring(1, index), Number(stackLine.substring(index + 1))]
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression used to extract the file name and line number from the stack line is different. The code in the placeholder code fragment uses the `String.prototype.match()` method to extract the values, while this code uses `String.prototype.lastIndexOf()` and `String.prototype.substring()` to extract the values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var fileNameAndLineNumber = [stackLine.split("(")[1].split(")")[0], stackLine.split(":")[0]]
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression used to extract the file name and line number from the stack line is different. The code in the placeholder code fragment uses the `String.prototype.match()` method to extract the values, while this code uses `String.prototype.split
