  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the wrong collection of ops, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual behavior of the transformPosition method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the next op in the iteration, rather than the type of the next op, leading to incorrect comparisons and changes in behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the current op in the iteration, rather than the type of the next op, leading to incorrect comparisons and changes in behavior.

DONE.
