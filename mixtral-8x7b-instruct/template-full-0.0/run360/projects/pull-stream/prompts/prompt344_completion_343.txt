 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort(abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` function would be called with the `abort` value as an argument, whereas in the original code, `onAbort` is called without any arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
global.onAbort && onAbort(abort === true ? null: abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the global `onAbort` variable is truthy, whereas the original code only checks if the `onAbort` argument is truthy.
