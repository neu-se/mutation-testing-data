  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted before the database is actually loaded, potentially leading to inconsistencies in the application.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', null
```
This would result in different behavior because a `null` error would be emitted, which could cause the application to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'key', null
```
This would result in different behavior because a `null` value would be emitted for the `key` event, which could cause the application to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
