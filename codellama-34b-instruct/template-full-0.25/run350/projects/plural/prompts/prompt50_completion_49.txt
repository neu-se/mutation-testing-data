  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]e$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match words that end in "e" instead of "o".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]o{2}$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match words that end in "oo" instead of "o".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]o{3}$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match words that end in "ooo" instead of "o".

DONE.
