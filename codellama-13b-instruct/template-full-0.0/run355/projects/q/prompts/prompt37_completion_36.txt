  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.exit()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `domain.exit()` function is called before the `task()` function, which would cause the `task()` function to be executed in the global scope instead of the domain scope.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.enter()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `domain.enter()` function is called after the `task()` function, which would cause the `task()` function to be executed in the domain scope instead of the global scope.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.run(task)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `domain.run(task)` function is called instead of the `task()` function, which would cause the `task()` function to be executed in the domain scope instead of the global scope.

DONE.
