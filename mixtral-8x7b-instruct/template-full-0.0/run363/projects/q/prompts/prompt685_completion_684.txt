 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly uses `Array.prototype.slice` to convert the arguments object to a real array, which is different from the original behavior of just using `arguments`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the array literal `[]` to create a new array, and then calls the `slice` method from that array's prototype, which is different from the original behavior of just using `arguments`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
arguments.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it assumes that `slice` is a method of the `arguments` object, which is not the case in all JavaScript environments. The original code uses the `array_slice` utility function, which handles cross-browser compatibility for this.
