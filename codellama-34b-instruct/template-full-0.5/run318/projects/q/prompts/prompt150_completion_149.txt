  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p.stack.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `p.stack.slice(1)` would return the stack trace without the first frame, which could cause the `isNodeFrame` function to return `true` for a frame that is not actually a Node frame.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p.stack.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `p.stack.slice(0, -1)` would return the stack trace without the last frame, which could cause the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function to return the wrong file name and line number for the last frame.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p.stack.split("\n").reverse()[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `p.stack.split("\n").reverse()[0]` would return the last frame of the stack trace, which could cause the `isInternalFrame` function to return
