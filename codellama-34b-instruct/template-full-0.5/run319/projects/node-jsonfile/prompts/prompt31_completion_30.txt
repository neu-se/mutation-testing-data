  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.encoding` is a string representing the encoding of the file, whereas `options` is an object that may contain other properties such as `throws` or `fs`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.throws
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.throws` is a boolean value that indicates whether the function should throw an error if the file cannot be read, whereas `options` is an object that may contain other properties such as `encoding` or `fs`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.fs
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.fs` is a reference to the file system module that should be used to read the file, whereas `options` is an object that may contain other properties such as `encoding` or `throws`.

DONE.
