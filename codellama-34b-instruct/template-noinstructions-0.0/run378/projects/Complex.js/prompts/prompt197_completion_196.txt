  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `z['re']` to access the real part of the complex number, while `z['im']` would access the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] + z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `z['re']` to access the real part of the complex number, while `z['re'] + z['im']` would access the sum of the real and imaginary parts.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] * z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `z['re']` to access the real part of the complex number, while `z['re'] * z['im']` would access the product of the real and imaginary parts.

DONE.
