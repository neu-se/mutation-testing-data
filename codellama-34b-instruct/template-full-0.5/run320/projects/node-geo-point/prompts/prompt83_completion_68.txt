  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the latitude value to be used in the calculation of the destination point, which would lead to an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the longitude value to be used in the calculation of the destination point, which would lead to an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1 + φ2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the sum of the latitude and longitude values to be used in the calculation of the destination point, which would lead to an incorrect result.

DONE.
