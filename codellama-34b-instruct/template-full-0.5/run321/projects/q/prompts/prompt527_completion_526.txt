  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object[op].apply(object, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the method on the object with the given name, rather than the method on the promise with the given name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object[op](args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the method on the object with the given name, rather than the method on the promise with the given name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object[op](args, object)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the method on the object with the given name, rather than the method on the promise with the given name.

DONE.
