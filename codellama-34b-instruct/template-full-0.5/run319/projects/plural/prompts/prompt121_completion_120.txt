  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/g, function(w) { return w.toLowerCase() }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `i` flag to perform a case-insensitive match, while the new code fragment uses the `g` flag to perform a global match. The `g` flag will match all occurrences of the pattern in the input string, while the `i` flag will perform a case-insensitive match.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/i, function(w) { return w.slice(0, -3) + 'ices' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `i` flag to perform a case-insensitive match, while the new code fragment uses the `i` flag to perform a case-insensitive match and then slices the input string to remove the last three characters and adds 'ices' to the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can
