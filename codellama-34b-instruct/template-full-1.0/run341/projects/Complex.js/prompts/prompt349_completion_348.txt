  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh(a) * cos(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the cosine of `a` is being multiplied by the cosine of `b`, which is incorrect. The correct behavior would be to multiply the cosine of `a` by the sine of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the product of `a` and `b` is a different value than the cosine of `a` times the sine of `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sqrt(a * a + b * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the square root of the sum of the squares of `a` and `b` is not equal to the cosine of `a` times the sine of `b`.

DONE.
