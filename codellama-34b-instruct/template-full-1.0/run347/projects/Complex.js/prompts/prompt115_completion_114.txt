  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code specifically checked whether `a` was greater than `b`, but `a + b` would be a different value and may not have the same relationship to `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code specifically checked whether `a` was greater than `b`, but `a - b` would be a different value and may not have the same relationship to `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code specifically checked whether `a` was greater than `b`, but `a * b` would be a different value and may not have the same relationship to `b`.

DONE.
