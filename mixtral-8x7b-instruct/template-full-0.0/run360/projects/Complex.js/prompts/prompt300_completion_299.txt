 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the argument to the `Math.cos()` function is changed, affecting the result of the `cot()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / a
```
This would result in different behavior because the reciprocal of the argument is used, potentially causing a division by zero error if `a` is 0, affecting the result of the `cot()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the absolute value of `a` is used, removing the sign of `a`, affecting the result of the `cot()` method.

DONE.
