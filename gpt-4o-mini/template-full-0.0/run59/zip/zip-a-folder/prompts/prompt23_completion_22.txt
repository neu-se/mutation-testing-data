Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiver('zip', { zlib: { level: 0 } });
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the compression level to 0, which means the output will be uncompressed, regardless of the specified compression level in the options.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiver('zip', { gzip: false });
```
This would result in different behavior because it disables gzip compression entirely, which would change the output format and potentially lead to an invalid zip file if the source is not compatible with the specified format.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiver('tar', { zlib: { level: 10 } });
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the compression level to 10, which is typically out of the valid range for zlib compression levels (0-9), potentially causing an error or unexpected behavior during the compression process.

DONE.
