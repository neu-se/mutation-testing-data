  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason && reason.stack !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `reason.stack` is undefined, while the new code fragment checks if `reason` is truthy and `reason.stack` is not undefined. If `reason` is a truthy value that does not have a `stack` property, the new code fragment would evaluate to `true`, while the original code fragment would evaluate to `false`.
