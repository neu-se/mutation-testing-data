  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the previous element in the `tokens` array instead of the next element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the element after the next element in the `tokens` array instead of the next element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the current element in the `tokens` array instead of accessing the next element.

DONE.
