  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `end` variable, causing the `once` function to be called even if the `end` variable is not truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && op
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator short-circuits the evaluation of the expression if the `end` variable is falsy, and the `op` function is only called if the `end` variable is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || op
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator short-circuits the evaluation of the expression if the `end` variable is truthy, and the `op` function is only called if the `end` variable is falsy.

DONE.
