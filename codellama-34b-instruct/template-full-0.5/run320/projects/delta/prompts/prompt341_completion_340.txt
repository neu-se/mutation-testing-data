  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new OpIterator(slice.ops).next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip over the first two elements of the `slice.ops` array, potentially causing the `next` method to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new OpIterator(slice.ops).next(10)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip over the first ten elements of the `slice.ops` array, potentially causing the `next` method to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new OpIterator(slice.ops).next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `next` method to return the first element of the `slice.ops` array, potentially causing the `reduce` method to have a different result.

DONE.
