  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.nfapply
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.nfapply` is a function that returns a promise, which may not be what the developer intended to use.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` is a function that resolves the deferred object, which may not be what the developer intended to use.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` is a function that schedules a function to be called after a specified delay, which may not be what the developer intended to use.

DONE.
