  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because the `re` property is the real part of the complex number, whereas the `im` property is the imaginary part. Using `this['re']` instead of `this['im']` would result in a different calculation and potentially a different outcome.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-this['im'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative sign would cause the calculation to result in a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 would cause the calculation to result in a different value.

DONE.
