Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!_read
```
This would result in different behavior because it will cause the code to enter the `nextStream()` function when `_read` is falsy, which is the opposite of the original logic that checks if `_read` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it will always evaluate to `true`, causing the code to always call `nextChunk()` regardless of the state of `_read`, which may lead to unexpected behavior when processing streams.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof _read === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `_read` is a string, which is not the intended type for `_read`. This will lead to `nextStream()` being called when `_read` is not a string, potentially breaking the stream processing logic.

DONE.
