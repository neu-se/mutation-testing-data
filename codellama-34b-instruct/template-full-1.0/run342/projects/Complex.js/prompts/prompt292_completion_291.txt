  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement code multiplies the values of `a` and `b`, while the original code only uses `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement code adds 1 to the value of `a`, while the original code does not modify the value of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / (b - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement code divides the value of `a` by the difference of the values of `b` and 1, while the original code does not modify the value of `a`.

DONE.
