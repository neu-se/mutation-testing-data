Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
cb(new Error('Unexpected error'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns an error, instead of returning `null` or `undefined` when the destination parent is the same as the source parent or the root path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
cb(null, { srcStat, destStat: srcStat })
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the source stat as the destination stat, instead of returning `null` or `undefined` when the destination parent is the same as the source parent or the root path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
cb(null, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a boolean value `true` instead of returning `null` or `undefined` when the destination parent is the same as the source parent or the root path, which could cause issues in the calling code that expects a specific type of return value.

DONE.
