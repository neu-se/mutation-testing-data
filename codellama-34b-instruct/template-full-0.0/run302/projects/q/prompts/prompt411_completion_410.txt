  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return inspected.value;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the fulfillment value, even if the promise is rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return inspected.reason;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the rejection reason, even if the promise is fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return inspected.state;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the state of the promise, regardless of whether it is fulfilled or rejected.

DONE.
