  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin(x)` returns a value between -1 and 1, while `x` may be a large number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs(x)` returns the absolute value of `x`, which may be different from `x` itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt(x)` returns the square root of `x`, which may be different from `x` itself.

DONE.
