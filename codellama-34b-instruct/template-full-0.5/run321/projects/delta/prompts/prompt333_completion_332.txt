  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property is not defined for the `attributes` object, which would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `values()` method is not defined for the `attributes` object, which would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys()` method is not defined for the `attributes` object, which would cause an error to be thrown.

DONE.
