  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `catch` is a method that handles rejected promises, whereas `then` is a method that handles both fulfilled and rejected promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.all
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` is a method that returns a promise that is fulfilled when all of the input promises are fulfilled, whereas `then` is a method that handles both fulfilled and rejected promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.race
```
This would result in different behavior because `race` is a method that returns a promise that is fulfilled or rejected when the first input promise is fulfilled or rejected, whereas `then` is a method that handles both fulfilled and rejected promises.

DONE.
