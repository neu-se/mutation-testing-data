  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the "length - 1" expression would decrement the `length` variable by 1, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the "length + 1" expression would increment the `length` variable by 1, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the "length * 2" expression would double the `length` variable, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
