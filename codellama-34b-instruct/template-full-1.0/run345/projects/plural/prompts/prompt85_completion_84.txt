  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mice', 'mice'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment contained a typo and the resulting bug would not be caught by the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mouse', 'dog'
```
This would result in different behavior because the test suite would expect the word "mouse" to be pluralized to "mice", but it would be pluralized to "dog" instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bird', 'mouse'
```
This would result in different behavior because the test suite would expect the word "bird" to be pluralized to "birds", but it would be pluralized to "mouse" instead.

DONE.
