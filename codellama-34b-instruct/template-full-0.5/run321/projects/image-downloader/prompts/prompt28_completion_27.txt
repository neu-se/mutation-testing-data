  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimRight().startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `trimRight()` will trim the characters from the right side of the string, whereas `trimLeft()` trims the characters from the left side of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.startsWith('https://')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the string starts with the substring "https://" instead of checking if the first character is "https".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.includes('https')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the string includes the substring "https" anywhere in the string, instead of checking if the first character is "https".

DONE.
