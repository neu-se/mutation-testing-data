 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeStackTraceLong` function would receive `null` as its argument instead of an `Error` object, which could cause unexpected behavior or errors in the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
error, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function would not be called with an error object, which could cause the returned promise to be resolved instead of rejected. This could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that uses the returned promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{} , promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function would receive an empty object instead of an `Error` object. This could cause unexpected behavior or errors in the code that handles the rejected promise, as it would not have access to the error message or other properties of the `Error` object.

DONE.
