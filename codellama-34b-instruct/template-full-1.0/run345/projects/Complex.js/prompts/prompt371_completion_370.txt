  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` returns the cosine of the argument, whereas `Math.sin` returns the sine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan` returns the tangent of the argument, which would give a different result than `Math.sin` or `Math.cos`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cbrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cbrt` returns the cube root of the argument, which would give a different result than `Math.sin`, `Math.cos`, or `Math.tan`.

Please let me know if you need more explanation for any of the options.

DONE.
