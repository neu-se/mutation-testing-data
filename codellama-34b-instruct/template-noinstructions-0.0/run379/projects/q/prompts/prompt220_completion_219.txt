  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would always evaluate to `true`, causing the `Q.longStackSupport` property to be set to `true` regardless of the value of `process.env.Q_DEBUG`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would always evaluate to `false`, causing the `Q.longStackSupport` property to be set to `false` regardless of the value of `process.env.Q_DEBUG`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.env.Q_DEBUG === "true"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would only evaluate to `true` if the value of `process.env.Q_DEBUG` is the string `"true"`, which is not the same as the original code fragment.

DONE.
