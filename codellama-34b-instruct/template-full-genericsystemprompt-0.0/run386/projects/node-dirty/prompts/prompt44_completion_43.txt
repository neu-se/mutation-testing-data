  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(key, updater(this.get(key)), cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `set` method with the updated value, but it would not delete the key if the updated value is `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(key, updater(this.get(key)), cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `set` method with the updated value, but it would not delete the key if the updated value is `undefined`.
