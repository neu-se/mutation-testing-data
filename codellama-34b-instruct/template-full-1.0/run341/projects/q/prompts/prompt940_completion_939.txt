  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the `arguments` object from the second element instead of from the first, which could cause the function to behave differently if it relies on the first element or if it is passed an empty array as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the `arguments` object up to the second-to-last element instead of slicing all elements, which could cause the function to behave differently if it relies on the last element or if it is passed only one argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 10)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the `arguments` object starting from the 10th element instead of from the first, which could cause the function to behave differently if it relies
