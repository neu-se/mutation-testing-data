  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise` object would be replaced with `null`, which would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to throw an error when it tries to access the `promise` object's properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise` object would be replaced with `undefined`, which would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to throw an error when it tries to access the `promise` object's properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise` object would be replaced with an empty object, which would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to throw an error when it tries to access the `promise` object's properties.

DONE.
