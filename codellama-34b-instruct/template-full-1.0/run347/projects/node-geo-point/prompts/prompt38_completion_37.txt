  Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin(x)` is always between `-1` and `1`, while `cos(x)` can be any value between `-1` and `1`.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
1 +
```
This would result in different behavior because `1 + x` is always greater than `x`, while `x` can be any value between `-1` and `1`.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs(x)` is always non-negative, while `x` can be any value between `-1` and `1`.

DONE.
