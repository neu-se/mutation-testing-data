  Sure, here are three possible options for mutating the code:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.split(".").pop().includes("tmp")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the destination path includes the substring "tmp", which might not always be the case. For example, if the destination path is "/abc/def.jpg", the original code would return true, but the mutated code would return false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.indexOf("tmp") >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the destination path contains the substring "tmp", which might not always be the case. For example, if the destination path is "/abc/def.jpg", the original code would return true, but the mutated code would return false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
option.tmp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the destination path ends with ".tmp" instead of
