  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stackLine` variable would be incremented by 1, causing the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function to return the wrong values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stackLine` variable would be decremented by 1, causing the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function to return the wrong values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"string"
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be attempting to get the filename and line number from a string, rather than the actual stack trace.

DONE.
