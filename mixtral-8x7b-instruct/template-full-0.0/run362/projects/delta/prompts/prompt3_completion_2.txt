 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.assign({}, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.assign` does not create a deep copy, unlike `cloneDeep`. It only performs a shallow copy, meaning that nested objects would still reference the original objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not copy the properties from `b` to the new object when `b` is not an object. The original `cloneDeep` would still copy the properties, ensuring that the result has the correct properties even when `b` is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(b))
