  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `callback` is a function that is expected to be called with a value, while `null` is not a function and would cause an error if called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `callback` is a function that is expected to be called with a value, while `undefined` is not a function and would cause an error if called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `callback` is a function that is expected to be called with a value, while `() => {}` is a function that does not take any arguments and does not return any value, which would cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
