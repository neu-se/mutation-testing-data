  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).th("<PLACEHOLDER>")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the text content of the element with the result of calling the `th` method with the `PLACEHOLDER` argument, which is not the same as the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the text content of the element to the result of calling the `text` method with the `PLACEHOLDER` argument, which is not the same as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).html(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the HTML content of the element to the result of calling the `html` method with the `PLACEHOLDER` argument, which is not the same as the original code.

DONE.
