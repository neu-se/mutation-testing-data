  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin` and `cos` are inverse trigonometric functions, and the `cos` function in the original code fragment is used to compute the x-coordinate of the destination point. Replacing it with `sin` would result in a different x-coordinate, which could potentially lead to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` generates a random number between 0 and 1, which could potentially lead to incorrect results when used in place of the `cos` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(x, y) => x + y
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function in the original code fragment is used to compute the x-coordinate of the destination point, and replacing it with a function that simply adds the x- and y-coordinates would result in a different x-coordinate, which
