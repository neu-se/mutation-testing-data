  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.off
```
This would result in different behavior because the `off` method is used to stop listening for events on an object, whereas the `on` method is used to listen for events.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.error
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` method is used to handle errors that may occur during the compression process, whereas the `on` method is used to listen for events.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` method is used to stop listening for events on an object, whereas the `on` method is used to listen for events.

DONE.
