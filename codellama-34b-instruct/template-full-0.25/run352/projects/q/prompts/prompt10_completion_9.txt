  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
define(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `define` is a function that expects a module name as its first argument, and passing `null` would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
define("foo", null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `define` is a function that expects a module name as its first argument, and passing `"foo"` as the module name would cause the module to be defined with the name `"foo"`. Passing `null` as the second argument would cause the module to be defined with no dependencies.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
define(function () { return null; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `define` is a function that expects a module name as its first argument, and passing a function that returns `null` would cause the module to be defined with a function that returns `null`.

DONE.
