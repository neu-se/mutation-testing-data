  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_shift()` returns the first element of an array, whereas `array_slice()` returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_pop()` removes and returns the last element of an array, whereas `array_slice()` returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_reverse
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in an array, whereas `array_slice()` returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array.

DONE.
