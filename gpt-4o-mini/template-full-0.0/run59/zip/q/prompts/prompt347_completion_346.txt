Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof rejected === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `_rejected` function to always reject the exception, regardless of whether a rejection handler was provided, leading to unhandled promise rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat a `null` value as a valid rejection handler, causing the `_rejected` function to not call the handler and instead always reject with the original exception, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in promise chains.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof rejected !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise if `rejected` is anything other than a function, which could lead to situations where valid rejection handlers are ignored, resulting in unhandled exceptions.

DONE.
