Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] + places
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the multiplication operation to addition, which will yield a different result for the imaginary part of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * (places + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the scaling factor by adding 1 to it, which will increase the value of the imaginary part after applying the ceiling function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because it mistakenly uses the real part of the complex number instead of the imaginary part, leading to an incorrect calculation for the imaginary component.

DONE.
