  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a different array, and the `nbind` function would be called with a different `thisp` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a different array, and the `nbind` function would be called with a different `thisp` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a different array, and the `nbind` function would be called with a different `thisp` argument.

DONE.
