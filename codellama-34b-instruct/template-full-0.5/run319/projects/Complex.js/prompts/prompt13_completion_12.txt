  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b < x || x < b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `x` is between `-b` and `b`, while the new code fragment checks if `x` is less than `-b` or greater than `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(-b > x || x > b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `x` is between `-b` and `b`, while the new code fragment checks if `x` is not between `-b` and `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b > x && x > b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `x` is between `-b` and `b`, while the new code fragment checks if `x` is greater than `-b` and less than `b`.

DONE.
