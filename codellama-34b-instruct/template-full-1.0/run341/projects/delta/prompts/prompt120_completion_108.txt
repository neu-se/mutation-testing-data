  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` is a property of the `Op` object that represents the length of the retain operation, whereas `delete` is a property that represents the length of the delete operation. Using `retain` instead of `delete` would cause the code to execute a retain operation with a different length, resulting in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` is a property of the `Op` object that represents the length of the insert operation, whereas `delete` is a property that represents the length of the delete operation. Using `insert` instead of `delete` would cause the code to execute an insert operation with a different length, resulting in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.delete + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to delete one more element than it would have with the
