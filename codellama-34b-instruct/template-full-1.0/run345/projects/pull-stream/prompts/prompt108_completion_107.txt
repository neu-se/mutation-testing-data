  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `cb` argument is strictly equal to `null`, rather than simply checking if it is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof cb === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `cb` argument is a function, rather than simply checking if it is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc instanceof Error
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `acc` argument is an instance of the `Error` class, rather than simply checking if it is truthy.

DONE.
