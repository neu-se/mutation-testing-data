  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Buffer.isBuffer(content) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Buffer.isBuffer` method checks if the given object is a buffer, and the `===` operator checks for strict equality. If the `content` variable is not a buffer, the `Buffer.isBuffer` method would return `false`, and the `===` operator would also return `false`, causing the `if` statement to be skipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.constructor === Buffer
```
This would result in different behavior because the `constructor` property of an object refers to the function that created the object, and the `Buffer` function is the constructor for buffer objects. If the `content` variable is not a buffer, the `constructor` property would not be equal to `Buffer`, and the `if` statement would be skipped.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content instanceof Buffer
```
This would result in different behavior because the `instanceof
