  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function expects an array of arguments, but `null` is not an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function expects an array of arguments, but an empty array is not a valid argument list.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function expects an array of arguments, but `[1, 2, 3]` is not a valid argument list for the `defer` function.

DONE.
