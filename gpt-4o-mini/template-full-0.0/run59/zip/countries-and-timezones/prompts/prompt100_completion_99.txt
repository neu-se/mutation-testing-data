Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(tzs).filter(key => tzs[key].deprecated)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return only the timezones that are marked as deprecated, effectively filtering out all non-deprecated timezones instead of returning all timezones.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(data.countries)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to iterate over the countries instead of the timezones, leading to incorrect data being processed and returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(tzs).map(key => tzs[key])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of timezone objects instead of an object containing only the non-deprecated timezones, which changes the structure of the returned data.

DONE.
