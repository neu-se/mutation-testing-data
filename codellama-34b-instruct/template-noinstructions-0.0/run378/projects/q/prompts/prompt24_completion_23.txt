  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("This is a bug");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not throw an error, but the replaced code fragment does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment continues to execute the rest of the function, but the replaced code fragment returns early.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment assigns a value to the `task` variable, but the replaced code fragment does not.

DONE.
