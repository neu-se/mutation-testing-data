  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `retDelta.delete` would delete the next operation from the delta, instead of pushing the next operation from the other iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.delete(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `retDelta.delete(0)` would delete the first operation from the delta, instead of pushing the next operation from the other iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.retain(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `retDelta.retain(1)` would retain the next operation from the delta, but the base iterator would still have the same number of operations, resulting in different behavior.

DONE.
