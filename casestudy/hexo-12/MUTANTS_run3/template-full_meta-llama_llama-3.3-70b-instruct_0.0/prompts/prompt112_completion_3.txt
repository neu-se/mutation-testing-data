Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data.slug.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the case of the slug to uppercase, which may not match the expected case in the `config.filename_case` transformation, potentially leading to incorrect slug generation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data.slug + 'test'
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends a fixed string 'test' to the slug, which would alter the resulting slug and may cause issues with slug matching or generation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data.title.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `title` property instead of `slug`, which may not be the intended value for slug generation, potentially leading to incorrect or unexpected slug creation.

DONE.
