  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.pow` and `Math.sqrt` have different mathematical properties, and using `Math.sqrt` instead of `Math.pow` would cause the function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.pow` and `Math.abs` have different mathematical properties, and using `Math.abs` instead of `Math.pow` would cause the function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.pow` and `Math.log` have different mathematical properties, and using `Math.log` instead of `Math.pow` would cause the function to return a different result.

DONE.
