  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete(key);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits an event with the size of the data, which would not happen if the data were deleted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits an event with the size of the data, which would not happen if the value associated with the key were `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits an event with the size of the data, which would not happen if the value associated with the key were undefined.

DONE.
