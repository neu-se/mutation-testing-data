  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` function is called immediately, whereas the original code fragment `inspect` is called later when the promise is settled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` function is called with the correct context, whereas the original code fragment `inspect` is called with the wrong context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect.bind(this)()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` function is called with the correct context and arguments, whereas the original code fragment `inspect` is called with the wrong context and arguments.

DONE.
