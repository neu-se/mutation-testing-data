  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` is a method of the `Function` object, while `call` is a method of the `Function.prototype` object. `apply` and `call` are similar, but they differ in how they handle the arguments passed to the function. `apply` takes an array of arguments, while `call` takes a list of arguments.

DONE.
