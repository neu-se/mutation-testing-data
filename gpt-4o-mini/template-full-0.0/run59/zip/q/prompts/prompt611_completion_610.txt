Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to set a property instead of getting its value, leading to an error or unexpected behavior when trying to retrieve a property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to delete a property instead of retrieving its value, which could result in the property being removed from the object rather than accessed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"invoke"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to invoke a method on the object rather than getting a property value, potentially leading to a runtime error if the method does not exist or is not callable.

DONE.
