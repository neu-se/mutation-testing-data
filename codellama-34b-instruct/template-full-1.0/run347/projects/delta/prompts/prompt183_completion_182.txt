  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the retain operation to retain one more element than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the retain operation to retain one fewer element than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the retain operation to retain the null value, rather than the intended element.

DONE.
