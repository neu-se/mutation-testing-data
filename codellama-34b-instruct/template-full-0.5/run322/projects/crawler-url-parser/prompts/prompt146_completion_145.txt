  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the "/index.[a-z]+$" pattern with "/", while the modified code fragment replaces the same pattern with an empty string, which would result in a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '/default'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the "/index.[a-z]+$" pattern with "/", while the modified code fragment replaces the same pattern with "/default", which would result in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '/default.[a-z]+$'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the "/index.[a-z]+$" pattern with "/", while the modified code fragment replaces the same pattern
