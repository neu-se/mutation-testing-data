  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first element of the `rule` array, which is a regular expression, instead of the second element, which is the function to be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the second element of the `rule` array, which is a function, instead of returning the function itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return rule[1]; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new function that returns the second element of the `rule` array, instead of returning the function itself.

DONE.
