  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(baseUrlStr, false, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` parameter value would cause the `URL.parse` method to not parse the query string, which could lead to incorrect results in the `extract` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(baseUrlStr, true, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` parameter value would cause the `URL.parse` method to not parse the path, which could lead to incorrect results in the `extract` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(baseUrlStr, true, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `true` parameter value would cause the `URL.parse` method to parse the query string and path, which could lead to incorrect results in the `extract` function.

DONE.
