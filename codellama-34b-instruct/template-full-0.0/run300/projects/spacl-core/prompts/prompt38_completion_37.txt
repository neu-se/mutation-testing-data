  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, whereas the `slice()` method returns a shallow copy of a portion of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').filter(Boolean)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter()` method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, whereas the `slice()` method returns a shallow copy of a portion of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').map(x => x.toUpperCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map()` method creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array, whereas the `slice()` method returns a shallow copy of a portion of the array.

DONE.
