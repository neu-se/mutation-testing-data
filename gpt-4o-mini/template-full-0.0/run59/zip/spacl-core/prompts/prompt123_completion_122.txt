Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.regex.props.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly return `false` if there are no properties in the regex, even if the path matches the regex pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.regex.test(path)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a different method to check for a match, potentially leading to incorrect results if the `test` method does not align with the intended matching logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.includes(this.regex)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the path includes the regex as a substring rather than matching the path against the regex pattern, which could lead to false positives or negatives in the matching logic.

DONE.
