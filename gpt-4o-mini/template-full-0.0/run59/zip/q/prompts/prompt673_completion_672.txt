Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would attempt to dispatch on `null`, which is not a valid object, leading to a runtime error instead of correctly processing the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would attempt to dispatch on `undefined`, which would also lead to a runtime error, as it cannot be used as a valid object for dispatching.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"string"
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would attempt to dispatch on a string, which is not a valid object for the dispatch method, potentially causing unexpected behavior or errors during execution.

DONE.
