  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 3
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the result of the substring function, potentially causing it to return a different word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the result of the substring function, potentially causing it to return a different word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the result of the substring function, potentially causing it to return a different word.

DONE.
