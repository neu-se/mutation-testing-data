  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = "GET";
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the `verb` variable to the string "GET", regardless of the actual verb being used in the request.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = this.verbs[verb];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the `verb` variable to the value of the `verbs` object at the key `verb`, which is not the same as the actual verb being used in the request.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = this.verbs[verb] = true;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the `verb` variable to `true`, regardless of the actual verb being used in the request.

DONE.
