 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only calls `deferred.resolve` without any arguments, whereas this modification always passes `null` as an argument. This could cause issues if the code downstream assumes that `deferred.resolve` will never be called with an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` is being replaced with `deferred.reject`, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved. This could cause issues if the code downstream is not prepared to handle rejected promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(deferred.resolve, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` is being used to wrap the call to `deferred.resolve`, which would cause the promise to be resolved asynchronously instead of synchronously. This could cause
