  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.promiseDispatch.apply(resolvedPromise, args.reverse());
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` array would be reversed before being passed to `promiseDispatch`, which could cause the promise to be resolved or rejected with a different value than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.promiseDispatch.apply(resolvedPromise, args.slice(1));
```
This would result in different behavior because the first element of the `args` array would be removed before being passed to `promiseDispatch`, which could cause the promise to be resolved or rejected with a different value than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.promiseDispatch.apply(resolvedPromise, args.concat(["extra_arg"]));
```
This would result in different behavior because an additional argument would be added to the `args` array before being passed to `promiseDispatch`, which could cause the promise
