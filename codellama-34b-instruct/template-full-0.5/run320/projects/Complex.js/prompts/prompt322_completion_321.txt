  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `2 * a` calculates the double of the value of `a`, while the new code fragment `1` always returns the value `1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `2 * a` calculates the double of the value of `a`, while the new code fragment `a + 1` calculates the sum of the value of `a` and `1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `2 * a` calculates the double of the value of `a`, while the new code fragment `b` returns the value of `b`.

DONE.
