 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because `[]` is an empty array, which would cause an error when trying to call the `plural` method on it. The original code fragment, `this`, refers to the current execution context, which is a string when the `plural` method is called from the `String.prototype.plural` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that does not have methods, so trying to call the `plural` method on it would result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object, which does not have a `plural` method. Therefore, trying to call the `plural` method on it would result in an error.

DONE.
