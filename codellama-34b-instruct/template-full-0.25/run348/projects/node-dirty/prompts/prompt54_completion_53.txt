  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is called immediately, rather than when the `drain` event is emitted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.on('drain', () => {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `on` method is called with an empty function, rather than with a reference to the `drain` event.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.off('drain', () => {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `off` method is called with an empty function, rather than with a reference to the `drain` event.

DONE.
