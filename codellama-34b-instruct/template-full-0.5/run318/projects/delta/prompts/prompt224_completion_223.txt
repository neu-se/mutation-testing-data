  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cursor + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the cursor would be incremented by one, potentially skipping over a character in the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cursor - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the cursor would be decremented by one, potentially moving the cursor to a previous character in the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cursor * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the cursor would be multiplied by two, potentially moving the cursor to a different position in the string.

DONE.
