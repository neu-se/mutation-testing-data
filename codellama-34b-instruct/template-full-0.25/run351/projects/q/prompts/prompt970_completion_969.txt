  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is passing the `name` variable as a string, while this replacement code fragment is passing the uppercase version of the `name` variable as a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name + "!"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is passing the `name` variable as a string, while this replacement code fragment is passing the `name` variable concatenated with an exclamation mark as a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is passing the `name` variable as a string, while this replacement code fragment is passing the length of the `name` variable as a number.

DONE.
