  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.then(void 0, void 0, progressed)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a promise that is resolved with the value of the `object` parameter, while the modified code fragment returns a promise that is resolved with the value of the `object.then(void 0, void 0, progressed)` expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(void 0, void 0, progressed)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a promise that is resolved with the value of the `object` parameter, while the modified code fragment returns a promise that is resolved with the value of the `Q(object).then(void 0, void 0, progressed)` expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(void 0, void 0, progressed).then(void 0, void 0, progressed
