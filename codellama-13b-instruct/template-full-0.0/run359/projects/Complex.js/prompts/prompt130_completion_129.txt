  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if both `this['isInfinite']()` and `z['isInfinite']()` are true, while the modified code fragment checks if either one is true. This could potentially cause the `add` method to return `Complex['INFINITY']` when it should not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && !z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if both `this['isInfinite']()` and `z['isInfinite']()` are true, while the modified code fragment checks if `this['isInfinite']()` is true and `z['isInfinite']()` is false. This could potentially cause the `add` method to return `Complex['INFINITY']` when it should not.
