  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === "function" && !define.amd
```
This would result in different behavior because with this new code fragment, the conditional statement would evaluate to true only if `define` is a function and `define.amd` is falsy, whereas the original code fragment would evaluate to true only if `define` is a function and `define.amd` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === "function" && define.amd === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because with this new code fragment, the conditional statement would evaluate to true only if `define` is a function and `define.amd` is equal to 1, whereas the original code fragment would evaluate to true only if `define` is a function and `define.amd` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === "function" && !/^define\.amd/.test(define)
```
This would result in different behavior
