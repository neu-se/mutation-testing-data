  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is expected to be an object, but `null` is a primitive value that will cause an error if the `concat` method is called on it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is expected to be an object, but `{}` is an empty object that will not have the expected `ops` property and will cause an error if the `concat` method is called on it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is expected to be an object, but `undefined` is a primitive value that will cause an error if the `concat` method is called on it.

DONE.
