  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([^.$])/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any character except for a period or a dollar sign, while the new code fragment matches any character except for a period.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([^.$]+)/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any character except for a period or a dollar sign, while the new code fragment matches one or more of any character except for a period.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([^.$]*)[.$]/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any character except for a period or a dollar sign, while the new code fragment matches any character except for a period followed by a dollar sign.

DONE.
