 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'type' in point
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the string 'type' exists as a property in the point object, rather than checking if 'type' is a direct property of the point object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(point, 'type')
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `call` method to explicitly set the `this` context to the point object, but it still checks if 'type' is a direct property of the point object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Reflect.has(point, 'type')
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Reflect.has` method to check if 'type' is a property of the point object, which may include inherited properties.

DONE.
