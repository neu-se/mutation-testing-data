  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first character of the stack trace, which could potentially change the line number and file name associated with the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.split("\n")[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the stack trace into an array of lines, and then select the second line, which could potentially change the line number and file name associated with the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.replace(/^.*\n/, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first line of the stack trace, which could potentially change the line number and file name associated with the error.

DONE.
