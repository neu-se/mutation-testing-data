  Sure, here are three different ways to replace the PLACEHOLDER in the `GeoPoint.calculateDestination` method:
```
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
point2.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the `point1` and `point2` parameters are swapped, leading to incorrect calculations for the distance and bearing between the two points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
point1.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the `longitude` property is replaced with `latitude`, leading to calculations that use the wrong coordinates for the destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
point2.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the `longitude` property is replaced with `latitude`, leading to calculations that use the wrong coordinates for the destination point.

DONE.
