 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback === null || typeof callback.apply !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat `callback` as `null` as a falsy value, while the original code treats it as an object with no `apply` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!callback || typeof callback.call !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `call` method instead of the `apply` method to check if `callback` is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!callback || callback.constructor.name !== "Function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `constructor.name` property to check if `callback` is a function, which would not work for functions created using the function constructor.

DONE.
