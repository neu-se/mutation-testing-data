  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(len + 8 - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the current code checks if the input word matches the base word when there are no rules, but with this new code, it always returns the base word even if the input word doesn't match the base word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
len
```
This would result in different behavior because the current code checks if the input word matches the base word when there are no rules, but with this new code, it always returns the base word without checking if the input word matches the base word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
len + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the current code checks if the input word matches the base word when there are no rules, but with this new code, it always returns the base word without checking if the input word matches the base word, but with an extra unnecessary addition operation.

DONE.
