  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the 'delete' operation, while the new code fragment checks for the 'retain' operation. The 'retain' operation is used to keep a portion of the text unchanged, while the 'delete' operation is used to remove a portion of the text. By replacing 'delete' with 'retain', the code will behave differently and may produce unexpected results.
