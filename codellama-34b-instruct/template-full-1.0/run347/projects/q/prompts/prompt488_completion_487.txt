  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections();
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would reset the unhandled rejections array, potentially hiding existing bugs in the unhandled rejection tracking mechanism.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections = [];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would directly manipulate the state of the unhandled rejections array, potentially causing issues with other parts of the code that rely on its contents.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit("unhandledRejection", reason, promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would bypass the tracking mechanism and emit an unhandled rejection event directly, potentially causing behaviors that would not be expected in a test environment.

DONE.
