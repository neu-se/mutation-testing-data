 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => nextStream()
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps the `nextStream` function in an arrow function, which may cause issues with context binding or unexpected behavior due to lexical scoping.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `nextStream` function with a boolean value, which would cause an error when called, as it is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `nextStream` function with the `values` variable, which is a different function imported from the `../sources/values` module. This would cause the `flatten` function to behave differently, as it would call the `values` function instead of the `nextStream` function.

DONE.
