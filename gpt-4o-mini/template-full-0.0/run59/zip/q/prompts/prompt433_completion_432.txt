Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly set `trackUnhandledRejections` to true when it is already false, potentially leading to unhandled rejections being tracked when they should not be.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!trackUnhandledRejections && false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to false, preventing `trackUnhandledRejections` from being set to true regardless of its current state, effectively disabling unhandled rejection tracking permanently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set `trackUnhandledRejections` to true only if it was already true, which means it would not reset the tracking state when it was false, leading to potential inconsistencies in tracking unhandled rejections.

DONE.
