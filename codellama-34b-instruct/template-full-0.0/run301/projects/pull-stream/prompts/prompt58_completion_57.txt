  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `done` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `done` is strictly equal to `null`. If `done` is any other falsy value (such as `undefined` or `false`), the original code would still execute the `if` block, but this new code would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `done` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `done` is not strictly equal to `null`. If `done` is any other falsy value (such as `undefined` or `false`), the original code would still execute the `if` block, but this new code would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof done === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if
