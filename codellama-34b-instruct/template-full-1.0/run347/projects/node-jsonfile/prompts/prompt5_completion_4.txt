  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random(), options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `universalify.fromCallback` function to be passed a random number as the first argument, rather than the expected `file` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `universalify.fromCallback` function to be passed `null` as the first argument, rather than the expected `file` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `universalify.fromCallback` function to be passed `undefined` as the first argument, rather than the expected `file` variable.

DONE.
