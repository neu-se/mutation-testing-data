  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, val] = this._data.entries().next().value;
```
This code fragment will assign the key and value of the first entry in the Map to the variables `key` and `val`, respectively.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, val] = this._data.get(key);
```
This code fragment will assign the value associated with the key `key` in the Map to the variable `val`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, val] = this._data.keys().next().value;
```
This code fragment will assign the first key in the Map to the variable `key`.

DONE.
