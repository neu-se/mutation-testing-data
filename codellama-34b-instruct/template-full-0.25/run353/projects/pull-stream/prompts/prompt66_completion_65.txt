  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === false ? null : end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the logic of the original code fragment, causing the function to return `null` when `end` is `true`, and `end` when `end` is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end !== true ? null : end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `end` is not equal to `true`, and if so, return `null`. If `end` is `true`, it would return `end`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end ? null : end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `end` is truthy, and if so, return `null`. If `end` is falsy, it would return `end`.

DONE.
