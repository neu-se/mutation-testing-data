  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the word would be incorrect, leading to the wrong plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the word would be incorrect, leading to the wrong plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the word would be incorrect, leading to the wrong plural form.

DONE.
