  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.delete(baseUrlStr);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` method is not being called on the `urlMap` object, which would cause the `baseUrlStr` to not be removed from the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set(currentUrl.url, currentUrl);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method is not being called on the `urlMap` object, which would cause the `currentUrl` object to not be added to the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retArr = retArr.map(function (el) {
	return {
		url: el.url,
		text: el.text,
		type: el.type
	}
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` method is not being called on the `retArr` array, which would cause the `el
