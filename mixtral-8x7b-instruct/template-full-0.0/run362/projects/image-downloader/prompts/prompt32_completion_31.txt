 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode !== 201
```
This would result in different behavior because the code now checks for a status code of 201 (Created) instead of 200 (OK), potentially causing the function to reject valid responses.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode > 299
```
This would result in different behavior because the code now rejects any response with a status code higher than 299 (including 3xx redirects), which might not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.headers['content-length'] !== '0'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code now checks the 'content-length' header instead of the status code, which might not accurately represent the success or failure of the request.

DONE.
