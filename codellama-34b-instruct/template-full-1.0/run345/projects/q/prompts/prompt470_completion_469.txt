  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process.emit()` method would be called with `reason` as the first argument, rather than `promise`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `unhandledReasons.length` would be passed as the second argument to `process.emit()`, rather than `promise`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `reportedUnhandledRejections.length` would be passed as the second argument to `process.emit()`, rather than `promise`.

DONE.
