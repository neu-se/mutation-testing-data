  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekType` method returns the type of the next operation in the iterator, and in this case, it would return `'retain'` instead of `'insert'`. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` and the code inside the `if` block would not be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, and in this case, it would return a non-zero value instead of `0`. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` and the code inside the `if` block would be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek() != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek
