  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `return reject(exception);` is inside a `try` block, so it will only be executed if an exception is thrown. However, the new code fragment `return reject(exception);` is not inside a `try` block, so it will be executed regardless of whether an exception is thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(new Error(exception));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `return reject(exception);` is inside a `try` block, so it will only be executed if an exception is thrown. However, the new code fragment `return reject(new Error(exception));` is not inside a `try` block, so it will be executed regardless of whether an exception is thrown. Additionally, the new code fragment will create a new `Error` object with the exception as the message, which may not be desirable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
