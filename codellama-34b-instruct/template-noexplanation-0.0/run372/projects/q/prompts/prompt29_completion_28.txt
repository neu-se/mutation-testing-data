  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.length + 1
```
This change will cause the loop to run one extra time, which may cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.length - 1
```
This change will cause the loop to run one fewer time than it should, which may cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.length * 2
```
This change will cause the loop to run twice as many times as it should, which may cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.

DONE.
