  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('read_close', 'foo');
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different from the original code, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code that listens to the event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('read_close', this._data.size);
```
This would result in different behavior because the event data is different from the original code, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code that listens to the event.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('read_close', this._data.size + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the event data is different from the original code, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code that listens to the event.

DONE.
