  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` checks if a value is Not-a-Number, while `isZero` checks if a value is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite` checks if a value is infinite, while `isZero` checks if a value is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `im` is a property that represents the imaginary part of a complex number, while `isZero` checks if a value is zero.

DONE.
