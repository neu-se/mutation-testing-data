  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\\b(?:goggle|scissor|plier|tong|tweezer|trouser|pant|pantie|clothe|billiard|bowl|card|dart|skittle|draught|kudo|premise|shamble|glasse|spectacle|jitter|alm|fece|bowel|sud|entrail|electronic|outskirt|odd|tropic|riche|surrounding|thank|heroic|remain|amend)s\\b/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex pattern would no longer match the words in the `misc` array, which are not pluralized in the same way as the other words in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\\b(?:goggle|scissor|plier|tong|tweezer|trouser|pant|pantie|clothe|
