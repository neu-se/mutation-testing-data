  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('a').attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the `href` attribute of the first `a` element in the document, rather than the entire `a` element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('a').eq(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first `a` element in the document, rather than the entire `a` element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('a').first()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first `a` element in the document, rather than the entire `a` element.

DONE.
