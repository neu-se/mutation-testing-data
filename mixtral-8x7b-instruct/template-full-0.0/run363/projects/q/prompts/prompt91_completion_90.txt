 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { throw new Error('Buggy slice'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would now throw an error instead of performing array slicing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.prototype.filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is used to implement the `array_map` function, and changing it to `Array.prototype.filter` would cause `array_map` to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(array, start, end) { return array; }
