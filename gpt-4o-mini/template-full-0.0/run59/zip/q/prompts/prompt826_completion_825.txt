Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise, error
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the order of the arguments, which could lead to incorrect handling of the error and promise in the `makeStackTraceLong` function, potentially causing the wrong context to be used when logging errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `error` argument with `undefined`, which means that the error handling logic would not receive the actual error object, leading to a failure in error reporting and potentially unhandled promise rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `error` argument with `null`, which may cause the `makeStackTraceLong` function to behave differently, as it might not expect a `null` value and could lead to unexpected results or exceptions in the error handling process.

DONE.
