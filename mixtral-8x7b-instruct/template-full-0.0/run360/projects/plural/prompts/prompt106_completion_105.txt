 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'\\b(?:' + tools.concat(clothes, games, illnesses, misc).join('|') + ')\\b'

This would result in different behavior because it misses the `s` character at the end of the regex pattern, which is used to match singular nouns that end in `-s`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'\\b(?:' + tools.concat(clothes, games, illnesses, misc).join('|') + 's' + '\\b'
