  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `abort` variable, meaning that the `abortCb` function would be called with a non-abort value, even if the `abort` variable is true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator adds 1 to the `abort` variable, which would cause the `abortCb` function to be called with a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator subtracts 1 from the `abort` variable, which would cause the `abortCb` function to be called with a different value than the original code.

DONE.
