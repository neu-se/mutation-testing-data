  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.off
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.off` is a different method than `output.on`, and it would not register an event handler for the "close" event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.once('close')
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.once('close')` is a different method than `output.on('close')`, and it would only register a handler for the "close" event once, rather than every time the event is emitted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.on('error')
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.on('error')` is a different event than the "close" event, and it would not handle the "close" event at all.

DONE.
