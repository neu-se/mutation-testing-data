  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if(arguments.length > 0){
  y
} else {
  throw new Error("INVALID INPUT: expected at least 1 argument.")
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would allow `y` to be returned when the `arguments` object has a length of 0, while the modified code fragment uses a conditional statement to ensure that `y` is only returned when the `arguments` object has a length greater than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!y
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would allow `y` to be returned when its value is falsy, while the modified code fragment uses the negation operator to ensure that `y` is only returned when its value is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof y == "number" ? y : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would allow any value, including
