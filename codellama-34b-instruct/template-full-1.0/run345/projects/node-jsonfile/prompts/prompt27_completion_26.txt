  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content + options.reviver
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a string, even if the `reviver` option is not a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content - options.reviver
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a string, even if the `reviver` option is not a string, and it would also return a different value if the `content` is not a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.reviver(content)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the result of the `reviver` function, which is not necessarily a string, and it would also return a different value if the `reviver` function is not defined or returns a different value.

DONE.
