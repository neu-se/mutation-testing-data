  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code computes the initial bearing from the two points, while this replacement code computes the final bearing, which is the opposite direction.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * θ
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code computes the initial bearing as the angle between the north vector and the segment between the two points, while this replacement code computes the initial bearing as twice the angle.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ - Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code computes the initial bearing from the two points, while this replacement code computes the initial bearing in the opposite direction, from the second point to the first.

DONE.
