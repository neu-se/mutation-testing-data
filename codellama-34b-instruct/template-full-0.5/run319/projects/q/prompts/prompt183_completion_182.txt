  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1[1] === "module.js"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only match stack lines that contain the string "module.js".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1[1] === "node.js"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only match stack lines that contain the string "node.js".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1[1] === "node.js" && attempt1[2] > 100
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only match stack lines that contain the string "node.js" and have a line number greater than 100.

DONE.
