  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimRight
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trimRight` method would be called on the `url` string, which would remove any trailing whitespace characters, whereas the original code fragment `url.trimLeft` would remove any leading whitespace characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase` method would be called on the `url` string, which would convert all characters to uppercase, whereas the original code fragment `url.trimLeft` would remove any leading whitespace characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property would be accessed on the `url` string, which would return the length of the string, whereas the original code fragment `url.trimLeft` would remove any leading whitespace characters.

DONE.
