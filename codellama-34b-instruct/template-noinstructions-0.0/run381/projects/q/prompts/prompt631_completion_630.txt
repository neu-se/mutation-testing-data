  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "delete" operation would be replaced with the "set" operation, which would cause the property to be set to a new value instead of being deleted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "delete" operation would be replaced with the "get" operation, which would cause the property to be retrieved instead of being deleted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "delete" operation would be replaced with the "post" operation, which would cause the property to be posted to a server instead of being deleted.

DONE.
