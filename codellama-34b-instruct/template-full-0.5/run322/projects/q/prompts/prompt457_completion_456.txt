  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the length of the `unhandledRejections` array, rather than checking if the `promise` is present in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the first element of the `unhandledRejections` array, rather than checking if the `promise` is present in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.indexOf(promise) !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `promise` is present in the `unhandledRejections` array, rather than checking the length of the array.

DONE.
