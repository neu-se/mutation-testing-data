  I have applied mutation testing to the code you provided, and I have identified three potential code fragments that could be used to replace the PLACEHOLDER in the code. These code fragments are:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const handler = Number;
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number` is not a function and would cause an error when trying to access the `invert` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const handler = Delta;
```
This would result in different behavior because `Delta` is a class and would not have the `invert` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const handler = Object;
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object` is a different type of object than `Delta` and would return a different value when calling the `invert` method.

DONE.
