  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c * d
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication of two complex numbers is not the same as the multiplication of their real and imaginary parts. The original code fragment is computing the product of the real and imaginary parts separately, which is not the same as multiplying the complex numbers directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the sum of two complex numbers is not the same as the sum of their real and imaginary parts. The original code fragment is computing the sum of the real and imaginary parts separately, which is not the same as adding the complex numbers directly.
