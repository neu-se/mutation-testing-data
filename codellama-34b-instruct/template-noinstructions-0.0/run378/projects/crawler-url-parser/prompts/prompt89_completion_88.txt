  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the text content of the current element, whereas the original code fragment would return the text content of the first element in the selection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).html()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the HTML content of the current element, whereas the original code fragment would return the text content of the first element in the selection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).val()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the current element, whereas the original code fragment would return the text content of the first element in the selection.

DONE.
