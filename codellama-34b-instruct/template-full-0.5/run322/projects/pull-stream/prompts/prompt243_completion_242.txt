  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `abort` variable, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even when `abort` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator returns the first truthy value, so if `abort` is `true`, the expression would return `true`, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator returns the first falsy value, so if `abort` is `true`, the expression would return `false`, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`.

DONE.
