 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data.timezones[name]
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly accesses the `timezones` object using the `name` instead of using the `memoizeTimezone` function to ensure the timezone is stored and memoized properly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
getTimezone(Math.random() * totalTimezones | 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it generates a random timezone index and retrieves a timezone using `getTimezone` instead of iterating over the keys of `data.timezones`. This introduces unpredictability and may cause issues if the randomly selected timezone doesn't exist.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
timezones.filter(tz => tz.name === name)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `filter` method to find the timezone with the specified name
