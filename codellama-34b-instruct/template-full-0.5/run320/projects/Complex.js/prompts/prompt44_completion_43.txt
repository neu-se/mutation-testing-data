  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the condition, making it always true when `b` is undefined, regardless of the value of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `a` is not equal to `b`, which is not the same as checking if `b` is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === undefined && b === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if both `a` and `b` are undefined, which is not the same as checking if `b` is undefined.

DONE.
