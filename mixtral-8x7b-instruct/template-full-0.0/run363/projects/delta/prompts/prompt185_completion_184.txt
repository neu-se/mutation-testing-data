 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
otherOp.retain !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider any `otherOp` with a non-null `retain` property as a "retain" operation, even if the property is not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
typeof otherOp.retain !== 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider any `otherOp` with a defined `retain` property as a "retain" operation, even if the property is not a number or null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'retain' in otherOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider any `otherOp` with a "retain" property as a "retain" operation, regardless of its value type or existence.

DONE.
