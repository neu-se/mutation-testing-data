  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the length property of the array would be set to 0, meaning that all elements in the array would be removed, rather than just the last element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1000
```
This would result in different behavior because the length property of the array would be set to 1000, which would result in the array being filled with undefined values up to index 1000, rather than just the last element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the length property of the array would be set to -1, which is not a valid value for the length property, and would result in an error.

DONE.
