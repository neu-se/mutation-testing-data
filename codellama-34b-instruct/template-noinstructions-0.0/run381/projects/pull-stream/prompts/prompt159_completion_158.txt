  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `_value` is a variable, while `_value + 1` is an expression that adds 1 to the value of `_value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_value * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `_value` is a variable, while `_value * 2` is an expression that multiplies the value of `_value` by 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_value - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `_value` is a variable, while `_value - 1` is an expression that subtracts 1 from the value of `_value`.

DONE.
