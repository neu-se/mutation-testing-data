  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the index for `splice` is now out of bounds, causing an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the value for `splice` is now a random number, causing the code to behave differently on each execution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the value for `splice` is now the length of the array, causing the code to behave differently if the array is empty or has a different number of elements.

DONE.
