Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl = urlMap.keys();
```
This would result in different behavior because `urlMap.keys()` returns an iterator of the keys in the map, not the values, which means `currentUrl` would not contain the expected URL objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (let currentUrl of urlMap.entries())
```
This would result in different behavior because `urlMap.entries()` returns an iterator of key-value pairs, so `currentUrl` would be an array containing both the key and the value, rather than just the value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (let currentUrl of urlMap.values().slice(0, 1))
```
This would result in different behavior because `urlMap.values()` returns an iterator, and calling `slice` on it would not work as expected, leading to an error or an empty iteration, thus not processing any URLs.

DONE.
