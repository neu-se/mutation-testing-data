  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]y$|quy$/gi
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regular expression indicates that it should be case-insensitive, allowing the `/quy$/` to match.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]y$|quy$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now case-sensitive, so the `/quy$/` will not match the word "quy".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]y$|qi$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `$` at the end of the regular expression is now escaped, so it will match words that end in "qi" instead of "quy".

DONE.
