 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'chilli'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a rule for the singular form 'chilli' and its plural form 'chillies', while this replacement only covers the singular form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'chilliess'
