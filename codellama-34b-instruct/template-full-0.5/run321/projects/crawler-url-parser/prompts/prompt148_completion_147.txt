  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `/` operator to split the `linkurl_path` string, but the new code fragment uses the `\\` operator, which would split the string at every backslash character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"//"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `/` operator to split the `linkurl_path` string, but the new code fragment uses the `//` operator, which would split the string at every forward slash character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"/"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `/` operator to split the `linkurl_path` string, but the new code fragment uses the `/` operator, which would split the string at every forward slash character.

DONE.
