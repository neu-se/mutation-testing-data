Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/x$|ch$|s$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends an extra 's' to the plural form of words that end with 'x', 'ch', or 's', leading to incorrect pluralization (e.g., "box" would become "boxes" instead of "boxess").

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/x$|ch$|s$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly removes the last character of the word before appending 'es', which would lead to incorrect pluralization (e.g., "bush" would become "buse" instead of "bushes").

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/x$|ch$|s$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior
