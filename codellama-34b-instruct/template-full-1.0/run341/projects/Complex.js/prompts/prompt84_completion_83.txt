  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['NaN'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was trying to exit the parser, while this code would return `NaN` instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['INFINITY'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was trying to exit the parser, while this code would return `INFINITY` instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log('Error!');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was trying to exit the parser, while this code would log an error message to the console instead.

DONE.
