  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    throw 'Invalid Param';
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws a SyntaxError, while this replacement throws a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    throw new Error('Invalid Param');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws a SyntaxError, while this replacement throws an Error object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    throw new TypeError('Invalid Param');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws a SyntaxError, while this replacement throws a TypeError.

DONE.
