 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
word.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the word instead of the last two characters when checking for words that maintain latin/greek plural.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'es'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always append 'es' to the end of the word, regardless of the pattern, when checking for words that maintain latin/greek plural.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
plural
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `plural` function instead of the last two characters of the word when checking for words that maintain latin/greek plural.

DONE.
