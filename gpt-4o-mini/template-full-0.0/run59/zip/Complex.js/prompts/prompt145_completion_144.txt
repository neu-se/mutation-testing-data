Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the current complex number is infinite instead of checking if it is zero, which would change the outcome of the multiplication when one of the operands is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly checks if the real part of the complex number is zero, which may not accurately reflect whether the entire complex number is zero, potentially leading to incorrect results in multiplication.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the result of the `isZero` check, meaning that the condition would now trigger when the complex number is not zero, which would alter the logic of handling the multiplication with zero.

DONE.
