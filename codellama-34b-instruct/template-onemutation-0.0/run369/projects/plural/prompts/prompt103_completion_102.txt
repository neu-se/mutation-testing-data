  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep|tiger)\b/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "tiger" is not present in the original code fragment, but it is included in the new code fragment. This would cause the test to fail if the word "tiger" is passed as an argument to the `plural` function, as it would not match any of the rules in the test suite.

DONE.
