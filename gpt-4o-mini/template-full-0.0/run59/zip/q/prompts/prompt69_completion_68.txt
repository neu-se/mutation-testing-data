Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port1.postMessage(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it sends a message to `port1` instead of `port2`, which may lead to the message not being received by the intended listener, causing the flush operation to not execute as expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port2.postMessage(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it sends a message with a different payload (1 instead of 0), which could potentially alter the handling of the message in the receiving end, leading to unexpected results in the flush operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port2.postMessage(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it sends a `null` value instead of a number, which may not be handled correctly by the message event listener, potentially causing the flush operation to be skipped or mismanaged.

DONE.
