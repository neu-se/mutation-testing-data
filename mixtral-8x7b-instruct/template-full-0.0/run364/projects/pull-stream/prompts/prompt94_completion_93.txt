 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is passing `null` as the first argument to the callback function, while this change would pass the current data being processed. This could cause issues if the callback function is expecting a specific type or value for the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is passing `null` as the first argument to the callback function, while this change would pass an empty object. This could cause issues if the callback function is expecting a specific type or value for the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is passing `null` as the first argument to the callback function, while this change would pass the callback function itself. This could cause issues if the original callback function is expecting a specific type or value for the first argument.

DONE.
