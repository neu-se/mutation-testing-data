  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `options.dest` property is falsy, while this replacement checks if it is exactly null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `options.dest` property is falsy, while this replacement checks if it has a length of 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.pathname.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `options.dest` property is falsy, while this replacement checks if the `pathname` property of the `options.dest` object has a length of 0.

DONE.
