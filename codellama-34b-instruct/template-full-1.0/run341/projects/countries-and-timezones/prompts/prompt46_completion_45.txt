  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options` object will be null and will not have any properties or methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options` object will be undefined and will not have any properties or methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ foo: 'bar' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options` object will have a single property `foo` with value `bar`, which is different from the original object.

DONE.
