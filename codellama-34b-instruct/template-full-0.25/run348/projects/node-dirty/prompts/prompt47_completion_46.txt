  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `cb` function, while the new code fragment does not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `cb` function with no arguments, while the new code fragment calls the `cb` function with a single argument (`null`).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `cb` function with no arguments, while the new code fragment calls the `cb` function with a single argument (a function that takes no arguments and returns nothing).

DONE.
