  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read + 1
```
This change will cause the `switch` statement to evaluate to a different value, potentially causing the function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read - 1
```
This change will cause the `switch` statement to evaluate to a different value, potentially causing the function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read * 2
```
This change will cause the `switch` statement to evaluate to a different value, potentially causing the function to return a different result.

DONE.
