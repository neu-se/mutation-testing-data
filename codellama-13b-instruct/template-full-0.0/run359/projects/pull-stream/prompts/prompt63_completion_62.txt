  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = !end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable would be negated, causing the loop to continue even if `read` returns `true` or `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = end && !abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable would be combined with the `abort` variable using the `&&` operator, causing the loop to continue if `end` is `true` and `abort` is `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = end || abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable would be combined with the `abort` variable using the `||` operator, causing the loop to continue if `end` is `true` or `abort` is `true`.

DONE.
