  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\t"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the stack trace to include a tab character instead of a newline character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the stack trace to include a space character instead of a newline character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the stack trace to include a backslash and the letter "n" instead of a newline character.

DONE.
