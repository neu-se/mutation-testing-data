  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.calculateDistance(this, point) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `calculateDistance` method returns the distance between two points, while the modified code adds 1 to the distance, effectively changing the destination location.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-GeoPoint.calculateDistance(this, point)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `calculateDistance` method returns the distance between two points, while the modified code negates the distance, effectively moving the destination location in the opposite direction.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.calculateBearing(this, point) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `calculateBearing` method returns the bearing between two points, while the modified code adds 1 to the bearing, effectively changing the direction of the destination location.

DONE.
