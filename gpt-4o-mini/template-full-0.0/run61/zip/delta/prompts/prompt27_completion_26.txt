Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(a).length > 0 ? attributes : undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `attributes` if there are any keys in `a`, regardless of whether `attributes` has any keys, potentially leading to incorrect results when `a` is not empty but `b` is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(b).length === 0 ? attributes : undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `attributes` only if `b` is empty, which is contrary to the original logic that checks if `attributes` has any keys, leading to incorrect handling of cases where `b` has values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(a).length < 1 ? attributes : undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `attributes` only if `a` has no keys, which would ignore the actual content of `attributes` and could lead to returning `undefined` when `attributes` should be returned.

DONE.
