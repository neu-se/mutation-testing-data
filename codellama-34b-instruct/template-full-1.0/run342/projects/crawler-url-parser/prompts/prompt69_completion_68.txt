  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1+1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to a variable, while the new code fragment is a mathematical expression that always evaluates to 2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"1"+"1"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to a variable, while the new code fragment is a string concatenation that always evaluates to "11".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{fooBar:`1+1`}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to a variable, while the new code fragment is an object with a property named `fooBar` that has the value `1+1`, which is a mathematical expression that always evaluates to 2.

DONE.
