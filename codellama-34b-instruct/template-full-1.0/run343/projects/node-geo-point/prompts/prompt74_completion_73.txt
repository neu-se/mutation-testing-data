  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ = atan2(y, x);
```
This would result in different behavior because `atan2` is a different trigonometric function than `deg2rad`, and would produce a different output value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ = acos(r > 1 ? 1 : r);
```
This would result in different behavior because `acos` is a different trigonometric function than `deg2rad`, and would produce a different output value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ = Math.PI * r;
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI * r` would produce a very different output value than `deg2rad(θ)` for most input values.

DONE.
