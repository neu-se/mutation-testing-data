  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `retain` property to be set to `null`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` and the `else` block to be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain = 'string';
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `retain` property to be set to a string, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` and the `if` block to be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain = { key: 'value' };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `retain` property to be set to an object, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` and the `if` block to be executed.

DONE.
