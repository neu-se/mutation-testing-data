  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.resume(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `res.resume(<PLACEHOLDER>);`, which would resume the response stream with the value of `<PLACEHOLDER>`. However, by replacing `<PLACEHOLDER>` with `null`, the response stream would be resumed with a null value, which could cause the `pipe` method to fail or behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
