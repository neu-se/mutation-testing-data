  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a method that invokes a function with a given `this` value and arguments, while `apply` is a method that invokes a function with a given `this` value and an array of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` returns a new function that, when called, will call the original function with a given `this` value and arguments, while `apply` and `call` call the function immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled.async
```
This would result in different behavior because `async` is a method that returns a promise for the result of calling the function with a given `this` value and arguments, while `apply` and `call` call the function immediately.

DONE.
