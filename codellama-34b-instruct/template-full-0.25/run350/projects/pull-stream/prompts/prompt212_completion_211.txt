  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb()
```
This would result in different behavior because `abortCb` is a function, and calling it would execute the function, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb = null
```
This would result in different behavior because `abortCb` is a function, and assigning `null` to it would overwrite the function with a null value, which would cause an error when the function is called later in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb = function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `abortCb` is a function, and assigning a new function to it would overwrite the original function with a new one that does nothing, which would cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
