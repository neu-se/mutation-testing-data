  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replace(/^\uFEFF/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only replaces the first occurrence of the Unicode Byte Order Mark (BOM) character, while this code fragment replaces all occurrences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replace(/^\uFEFF/g, EOL)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `g` flag to replace all occurrences of the BOM character, while this code fragment only replaces the first occurrence.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replace(/^\uFEFF/, EOL)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `g` flag to replace all occurrences of the BOM character, while this code fragment only replaces the first occurrence.

DONE.
