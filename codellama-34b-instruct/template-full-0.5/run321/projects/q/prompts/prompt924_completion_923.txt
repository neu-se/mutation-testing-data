  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra argument to the `nodeArgs` array, which could cause the function to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.shift(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove an argument from the `nodeArgs` array, which could cause the function to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.slice(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove all arguments from the `nodeArgs` array except for the first one, which could cause the function to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
