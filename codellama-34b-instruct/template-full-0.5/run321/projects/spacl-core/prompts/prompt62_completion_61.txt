  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.slice(0).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `props.slice(0)` creates a shallow copy of the `props` array, which is then reversed, whereas `props.reverse()` reverses the original `props` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.concat().reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `props.concat()` creates a new array that is a concatenation of `props` and an empty array, which is then reversed, whereas `props.reverse()` reverses the original `props` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.reduce((acc, curr) => curr + acc, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because `props.reduce()` reduces the `props` array to a single value by concatenating each element with the previous element, whereas `props.reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in the `props` array.
