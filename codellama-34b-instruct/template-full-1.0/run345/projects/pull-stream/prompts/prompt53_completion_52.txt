  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `s` is an object, while the replacement code fragment checks if `s` is not equal to the string `'object'`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `s` is an object, while the replacement code fragment checks if `s` is not equal to `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s && s.toString() === '[object Object]'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `s` is an object, while the replacement code fragment checks if `s` is an object and has the string representation `'[object Object]'`.

DONE.
