  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a` variable is not defined in the scope of the function, and would cause a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b` variable is multiplied by 2, which would change the result of the `cos` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.sin` function is applied to the `b` variable, which would change the result of the `cos` function.

DONE.
