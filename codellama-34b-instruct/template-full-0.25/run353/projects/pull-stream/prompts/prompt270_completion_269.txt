  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream && 'function' === typeof stream
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `stream` is a function, rather than an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream && 'object' === typeof stream && 'function' === typeof stream.next
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `stream` is an object with a `next` function, rather than just an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream && 'object' === typeof stream && 'function' === typeof stream.next && stream.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `next` function of `stream`, rather than just checking if it exists.

DONE.
