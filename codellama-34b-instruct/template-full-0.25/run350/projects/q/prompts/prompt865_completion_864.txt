  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a value to be passed to `Q.delay`, but `null` would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a value to be passed to `Q.delay`, but `undefined` would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a non-zero value to be passed to `Q.delay`, but `0` would cause the promise to be resolved immediately.

DONE.
