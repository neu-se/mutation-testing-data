  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(object).inspect(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method would always return `null`, regardless of the value of `object`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(object).inspect(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method would always return `undefined`, regardless of the value of `object`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(object).inspect(void 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method would always return `void 0`, regardless of the value of `object`.

DONE.
