  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` event is not the same as the `drain` event. The `close` event is emitted when the connection is closed, while the `drain` event is emitted when all data has been written to the socket.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` event is not the same as the `drain` event. The `error` event is emitted when an error occurs, while the `drain` event is emitted when all data has been written to the socket.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` event is not the same as the `drain` event. The `end` event is emitted when the connection is closed, while the `drain` event is emitted when all data has been written to the socket.
