  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'abs' in a && 'arg' in b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `in` operator checks if a property exists in an object, and the property names are different in the two objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'abs' in b && 'arg' in a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `in` operator checks if a property exists in an object, and the property names are different in the two objects.
