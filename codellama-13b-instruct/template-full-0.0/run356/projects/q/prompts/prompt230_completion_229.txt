  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op === "when" && operands[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `op` is equal to "when" and the `operands[1]` is truthy, while the buggy code fragment checks if the `op` is equal to "when" and the `operands[1]` is truthy, regardless of the value of `operands[1]`. This could result in different behavior if the `operands[1]` is not truthy, as the original code fragment would not execute the `when` operation in that case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op === "when" && operands[1] === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `op` is equal to "when" and the `operands[1]` is truthy, while the buggy code fragment checks if the `op` is equal to "when" and the `operands[1]` is equal to `true`. This could
