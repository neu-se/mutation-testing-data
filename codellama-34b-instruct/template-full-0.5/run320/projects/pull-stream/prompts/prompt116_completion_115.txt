  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err, acc,
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra argument to the callback function, which would cause it to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err, data,
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the wrong value to the callback function, which would cause it to return an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, acc,
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a null value as the first argument to the callback function, which would cause it to return an incorrect result.

DONE.
