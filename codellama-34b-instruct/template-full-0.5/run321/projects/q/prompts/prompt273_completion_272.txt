  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"progress"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always pass the string "progress" as an argument to the progressListener function, regardless of the actual progress value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progress + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always pass the incremented progress value as an argument to the progressListener function, regardless of the actual progress value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progress * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always pass the doubled progress value as an argument to the progressListener function, regardless of the actual progress value.

DONE.
