  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a specific `this` context, which may not be what the original code intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` immediately invokes the function with the specified `this` context, which may not be what the original code intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` immediately invokes the function with the specified `this` context and arguments, which may not be what the original code intended.

DONE.
