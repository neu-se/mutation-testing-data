  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deliverTimezones(timezones, { deprecated: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deliverTimezones` function would return all timezones, including deprecated ones, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deliverTimezones(timezones, { deprecated: false })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deliverTimezones` function would return only non-deprecated timezones, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deliverTimezones(timezones, {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deliverTimezones` function would return all timezones, including deprecated ones, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

DONE.
