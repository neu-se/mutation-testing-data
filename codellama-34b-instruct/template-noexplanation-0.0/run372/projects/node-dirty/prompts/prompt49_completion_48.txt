  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater + 1
```
This change will cause the `update` method to increment the value stored at the given key by 1, rather than simply setting it to the value returned by the `updater` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater - 1
```
This change will cause the `update` method to decrement the value stored at the given key by 1, rather than simply setting it to the value returned by the `updater` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater * 2
```
This change will cause the `update` method to double the value stored at the given key, rather than simply setting it to the value returned by the `updater` function.

DONE.
