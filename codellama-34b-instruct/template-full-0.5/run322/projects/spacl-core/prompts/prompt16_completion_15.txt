  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^.+\/$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any string that ends with a forward slash, while the new code fragment matches any string that starts with a forward slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^.+\/$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any string that ends with a forward slash, while the new code fragment matches any string that starts with a forward slash and contains at least one character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^.+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any string that ends with a forward slash, while the new code fragment matches any string that contains at least one character.

DONE.
