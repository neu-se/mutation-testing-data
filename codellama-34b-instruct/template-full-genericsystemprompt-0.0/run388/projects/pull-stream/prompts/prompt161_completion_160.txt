  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `null` as the second argument, regardless of the value of `value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `undefined` as the second argument, regardless of the value of `value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the value of `value` as the second argument, regardless of whether it is `null` or not.

DONE.
