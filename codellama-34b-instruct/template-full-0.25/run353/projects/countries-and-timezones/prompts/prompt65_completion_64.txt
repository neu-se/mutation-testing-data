  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] = null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign `null` to the `countries[id]` property, which would cause the `getCountry` function to return `null` instead of the expected country object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] = {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign an empty object to the `countries[id]` property, which would cause the `getCountry` function to return an empty object instead of the expected country object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] = { id: id }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign an object with a single property `id` to the `countries[id]` property, which would cause the `getCountry` function to return an object with a single property `id` instead of the expected country object.

DONE.
