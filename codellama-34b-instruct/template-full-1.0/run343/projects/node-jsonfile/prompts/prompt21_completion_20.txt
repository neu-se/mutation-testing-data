  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, { encoding: 'utf8' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `encoding` option is not considered when calling `fs.readFileSync`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, { mode: '400' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `mode` option is not considered when calling `fs.readFileSync`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, { flag: 'ax' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flag` option is not considered when calling `fs.readFileSync`.

DONE.
