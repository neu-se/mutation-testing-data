  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `callback` parameter is `undefined`, while the new code fragment checks if it is not `undefined`. This change would cause the `Q.nfbind` function to always return a function, even if the `callback` parameter is not provided, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that uses this function.

DONE.
