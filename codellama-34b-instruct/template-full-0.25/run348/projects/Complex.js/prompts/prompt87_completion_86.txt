  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` function returns `true` if the argument is NaN, and `false` otherwise. Using `!isNaN` would return `false` if the argument is NaN, and `true` otherwise, which would cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite` function returns `true` if the argument is a finite number, and `false` otherwise. Using `isFinite` would return `true` if the argument is a finite number, and `false` otherwise, which would cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Number.isNaN` function returns `true` if the argument is NaN, and `false` otherwise. Using `Number.isNaN` would return `true` if the
