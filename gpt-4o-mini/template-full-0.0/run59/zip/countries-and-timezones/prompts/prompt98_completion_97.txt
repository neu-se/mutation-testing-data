Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deprecated === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the timezones regardless of whether they are marked as deprecated, effectively including all timezones instead of filtering out the deprecated ones.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the timezones when the `deprecated` option is falsy (i.e., `undefined` or `false`), which would include all timezones instead of only the non-deprecated ones.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deprecated != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the timezones if the `deprecated` option is set to any value other than `null`, which would include both `true` and `false`, thus potentially including deprecated timezones when the intention was to exclude them.

DONE.
