  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer.slice(0, -1)}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would omit the last character of the buffer, which could potentially cause the error message to be incomplete or misleading.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer.toUpperCase()}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would uppercase the entire buffer, which could potentially cause the error message to be different from the original and may not accurately reflect the actual contents of the buffer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer.split('').reverse().join('')}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the characters in the buffer, which could potentially cause the error message to be different from the original and may not accurately reflect
