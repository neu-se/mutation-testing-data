  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid value for the `fulfilled` and `rejected` callbacks, and the promise would not be resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid value for the `fulfilled` and `rejected` callbacks, and the promise would not be resolved or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("foo")
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` statement would throw an error, making the promise to be rejected, and the `fulfilled` and `rejected` callbacks would not be called.

DONE.
