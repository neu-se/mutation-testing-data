  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b == null
```
This would result in different behavior because `b == null` checks for both null and undefined values, whereas the original code fragment only checks for null values. This could lead to different behavior when comparing objects, as Object.keys() will throw an error if called on a null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!b
```
This would result in different behavior because `!b` checks for any falsy value, including null, undefined, NaN, 0, and empty strings. This could lead to different behavior when comparing objects, as Object.keys() will throw an error if called on a null or undefined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Object.keys(b).length
```
This would result in different behavior because `!Object.keys(b).length` checks if the object is empty, regardless of whether it's null or undefined. This could lead to different behavior in some edge cases, such as when comparing objects with
