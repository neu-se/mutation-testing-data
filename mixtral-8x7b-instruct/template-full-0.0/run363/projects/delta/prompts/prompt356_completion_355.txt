 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.transformPosition.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the context of `this` within the `transformPosition` function, potentially causing issues if the function relies on accessing instance properties or methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.transformPosition(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes a hardcoded argument `1` to the `transformPosition` function, which may not be the desired index value in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.transformPosition = () => {};
```
This would result in different behavior because it reassigns the `transformPosition` property to an empty arrow function, effectively removing its original functionality.

DONE.
