  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek` returns the upcoming operation without advancing the iterator, while `next` returns the next operation and advances the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(otherOp.retain!.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because `next` takes an optional argument `length` that specifies the number of operations to advance the iterator by, while `peek` does not have such an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(otherOp.retain!.length, otherOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because `next` does not have an overload that takes `attributes` as an argument, while `peek` does.

DONE.
