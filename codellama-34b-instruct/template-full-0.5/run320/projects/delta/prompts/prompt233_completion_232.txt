  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method returns the next element in the iteration, whereas the original code fragment uses the `peek` method to return the next element without advancing the iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method returns the next element in the iteration, whereas the original code fragment uses the `peek` method to return the next element without advancing the iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek` method returns the next element in the iteration without advancing the iteration, whereas the original code fragment uses the `next` method to return the next element and advance the iteration.

DONE.
