  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.clear()
```
This would result in different behavior because `clear()` removes all elements from the map, whereas `delete()` removes only the specified element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(row.key, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `set()` with `undefined` as the value would set the value for the specified key to `undefined`, whereas `delete()` would remove the key-value pair altogether.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(row.key)
```
This would result in different behavior because `get()` would retrieve the value for the specified key, whereas `delete()` would remove the key-value pair altogether.

DONE.
