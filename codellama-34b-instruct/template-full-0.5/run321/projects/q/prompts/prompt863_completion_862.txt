  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeout + 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the timeout would be increased by 10 milliseconds, which could cause the promise to be rejected later than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeout - 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the timeout would be decreased by 10 milliseconds, which could cause the promise to be rejected earlier than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the timeout would be set to 0 milliseconds, which would cause the promise to be rejected immediately.

DONE.
