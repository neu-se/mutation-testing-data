  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(this, zoom + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile` method would be called with a different zoom level, which could cause the function to return a different tile.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(this, zoom - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile` method would be called with a different zoom level, which could cause the function to return a different tile.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(this, zoom * 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile` method would be called with a different zoom level, which could cause the function to return a different tile.

DONE.
