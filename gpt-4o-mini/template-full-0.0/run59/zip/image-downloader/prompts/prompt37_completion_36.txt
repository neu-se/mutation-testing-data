Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
createWriteStream('invalid/path')
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to create a write stream to an invalid file path, which would cause an error when trying to pipe the response data, leading to a rejection that would not occur with a valid path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.pipe(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because piping the response to `null` effectively discards the data, which may not trigger an error but would result in lost data and potentially lead to unexpected behavior in the application.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.pipe(createWriteStream(dest, { flags: 'a' }))
```
This would result in different behavior because it opens the write stream in append mode instead of the default mode, which would cause the downloaded file to be appended to if it already exists, rather than overwriting it, leading to different file contents.

DONE.
