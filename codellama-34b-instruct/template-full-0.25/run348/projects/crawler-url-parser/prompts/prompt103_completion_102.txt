  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.includes(text)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `text` property of `tmpUrl` to be updated with the value of `text`, rather than concatenating the two values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.indexOf(text) > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the value of `text` is a substring of `tmpUrl.text`, rather than checking if `tmpUrl.text` includes `text`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.match(text)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the value of `text` matches the regular expression `tmpUrl.text`, rather than checking if `tmpUrl.text` includes `text`.

DONE.
