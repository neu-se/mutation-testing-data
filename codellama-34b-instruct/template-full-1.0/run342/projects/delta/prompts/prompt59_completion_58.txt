  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops * ops
```
This would result in different behavior because `ops` is an array, and multiplying an array by an array in JavaScript returns a new array with the same elements repeated. This is unlikely to be the intended behavior in this context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops + ops
```
This would result in different behavior because `ops` is an array, and adding an array to an array in JavaScript returns a new array with the elements of both arrays concatenated. This is unlikely to be the intended behavior in this context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `ops` is an array, and accessing its first element with `ops[0]` would return a different value than `ops.ops`, which is likely intended to be a reference to the `ops` property of the `ops` object.

DONE.
