 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would always receive `false` instead of the actual value from the array. This could cause issues if the consumer of this function is relying on the correct value being passed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not increment the `i` variable, causing the same value to be returned for every call to the returned function. This could cause issues if the consumer of this function is expecting a new value on each call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(i >= array.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the boolean condition to the callback instead of the array value. This could cause issues if the consumer of this function is expecting the actual value from the array.

DONE.
