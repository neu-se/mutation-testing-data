  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` and `Math.cos` have different values and the resulting `Complex` object would have a different real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan` has a different range of values than `Math.cos` and the resulting `Complex` object would have a different real part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.acos` is the inverse function of `Math.cos` and the resulting `Complex` object would have a different real part.

DONE.
