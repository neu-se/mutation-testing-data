  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push()
```
This would result in different behavior because `parts.push()` is a method that adds an element to the end of an array, while `parts.push` is a property that references the `push` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `parts.push(undefined)` would add `undefined` to the end of the `parts` array, while `parts.push` would not add anything to the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `parts.push(null)` would add `null` to the end of the `parts` array, while `parts.push` would not add anything to the array.

DONE.
