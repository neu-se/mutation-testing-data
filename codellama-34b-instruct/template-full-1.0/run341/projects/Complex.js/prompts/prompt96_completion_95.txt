  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + tokens[i + 1];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code parses the next token as a float, while this replacement simply adds 1 to the next token.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code parses the next token as a float, while this replacement adds 1 to the next token and then parses the result as a float.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] + tokens[i - 1];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code parses the next token as a float, while this replacement adds the current token to the previous token and then parses the result as a float.

DONE.
