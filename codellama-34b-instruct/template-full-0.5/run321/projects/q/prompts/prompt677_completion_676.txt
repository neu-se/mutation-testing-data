  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [this, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of `this` inside the `dispatch` method, which could cause the method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, args.slice(1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of `args` inside the `dispatch` method, which could cause the method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, [].concat(args)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of `args` inside the `dispatch` method, which could cause the method to behave differently.

DONE.
