  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by 2 would cause the angle to be doubled, which would result in a different bearing calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 180 would cause the angle to be shifted by 180 degrees, which would result in a different bearing calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ - 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 180 would cause the angle to be shifted by -180 degrees, which would result in a different bearing calculation.

DONE.
