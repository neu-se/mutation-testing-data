Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly remove the next element in the array instead of the intended element at index `at`, potentially leading to an incorrect state of `unhandledRejections` and `unhandledReasons`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the element at index `at` from `unhandledRejections` but would not remove the corresponding entry from `unhandledReasons`, leading to a mismatch in the two arrays.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always remove the first element of the `unhandledRejections` array regardless of which promise was actually untracked, potentially causing incorrect handling of unhandled rejections.

DONE.
