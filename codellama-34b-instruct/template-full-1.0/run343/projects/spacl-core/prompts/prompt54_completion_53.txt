  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push(part.replace(/([/_$])/g, '\\$1'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now only escaping the `/` and `_` characters, but not the `$` character, which could lead to unexpected results in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push(part.replace(/([^/_$])/g, '\\$1'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now only escaping characters that are not `/`, `_`, or `$`, but not the `/` character, which could lead to unexpected results in some cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push(part.replace(/([/\-$])/g, '\\$1'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now only escaping the `/`, `-`, and `$` characters, but not the `_` character, which could lead to unexpected results
