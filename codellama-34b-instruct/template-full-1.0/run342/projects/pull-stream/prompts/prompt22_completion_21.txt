  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function would be called twice, which may not be the intended behavior of the `pull` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read.apply(null, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read.apply` method would be called with a different set of arguments than `pull` was originally called with, which may cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function would be called with a different set of arguments than `pull` was originally called with, which may cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
