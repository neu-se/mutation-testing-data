  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument passed to `array_slice` is now `2` instead of `1`, which would cause the function to return a different slice of the `arguments` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument passed to `array_slice` is now `1` instead of `2`, which would cause the function to return a different slice of the `arguments` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument passed to `array_slice` is now `2` instead of `1`, which would cause the function to return a different slice of the `arguments` array.
