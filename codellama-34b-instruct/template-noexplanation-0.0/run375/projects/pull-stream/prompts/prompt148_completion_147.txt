  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This change will cause the function to return the values of the object's properties, rather than the keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This change will cause the function to return an array of key-value pairs for the object's properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.getOwnPropertyNames
```
This change will cause the function to return an array of the object's own property names.

DONE.
