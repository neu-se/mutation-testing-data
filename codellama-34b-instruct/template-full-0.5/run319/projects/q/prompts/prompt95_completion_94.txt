  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the index is greater than or equal to the length, while this replacement checks if the index is strictly greater than the length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length > index
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the index is greater than or equal to the length, while this replacement checks if the length is strictly greater than the index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index >= length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the index is strictly greater than the length, while this replacement checks if the index is greater than or equal to the length.

DONE.
