Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(task, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the execution context of the task to be asynchronous, potentially leading to different timing and order of execution compared to the original synchronous call in `runSingle`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task.call(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly sets the `this` context of the task to `null`, which may affect how the task behaves if it relies on the context in which it was defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Task execution failed");
```
This would result in different behavior because it immediately throws an error instead of executing the task, which would disrupt the normal flow of the program and potentially lead to unhandled exceptions.

DONE.
