  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only iterate over the first element of the `sources` object, rather than all of them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k = Object.keys(sources).length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only iterate over the last element of the `sources` object, rather than all of them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k = Math.floor(Math.random() * Object.keys(sources).length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate over a random element of the `sources` object, rather than all of them.

DONE.
