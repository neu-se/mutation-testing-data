  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because `pageurl.host` is a string, while `pageurl` is an object with properties such as `host`, `path`, and `search`. Using `pageurl.host` would cause the `gettype` function to return a different value, potentially leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
