Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(pathname)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname` returns the directory name of the given path, rather than the base filename, which would lead to an incorrect destination path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pathname.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because this code retrieves the last segment of the pathname, which may not correctly handle URL-encoded filenames, potentially leading to an incorrect or malformed destination filename.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pathname.replace(/.*\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because this regex replaces everything up to the last slash with an empty string, which could lead to an incorrect filename if the pathname contains multiple slashes or if the last segment is empty.

DONE.
