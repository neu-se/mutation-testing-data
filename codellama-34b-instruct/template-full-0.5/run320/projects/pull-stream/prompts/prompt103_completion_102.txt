  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would add 1 to the value of `data`, which could change the output of the `console.log` statement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator would multiply the value of `data` by 2, which could change the output of the `console.log` statement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would log the length of the `data` array, rather than the value of `data` itself.

DONE.
