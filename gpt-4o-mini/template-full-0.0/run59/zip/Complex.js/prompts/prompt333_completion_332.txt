Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `b` is equal to zero instead of checking if `b` is equal to -1, which would change the condition under which the function returns a complex number with a negative infinity imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `b` is not equal to -1, which would allow the function to return a complex number for any value of `b` other than -1, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `b` is greater than -1, which would change the logic of the condition and could lead to the function returning a complex number even when `b` is less than or equal to -1, altering the expected output.

DONE.
