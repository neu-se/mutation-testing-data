 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
point.coordinates.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly validate arrays with a single element, causing the `fromGeoJSON` method to return a `GeoPoint` instance when it shouldn't.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.prototype.includes.call(point.coordinates, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly validate arrays containing `undefined`, causing the `fromGeoJSON` method to return a `GeoPoint` instance when it shouldn't.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
point.coordinates.toString().length === 2
