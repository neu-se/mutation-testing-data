  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType + "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the string "foo" to the embedType, which would change the key used to retrieve the handler for the embed type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the embedType by 2, which would result in a different key being used to retrieve the handler for the embed type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the embedType, which would result in a different key being used to retrieve the handler for the embed type.

DONE.
