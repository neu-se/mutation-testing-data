  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` function is called instead of the `cb` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value is passed to the `cb` function instead of the expected error object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => cb
```
This would result in different behavior because a new function is created and called, which could have unintended consequences if the `abort` function has side effects.

DONE.
