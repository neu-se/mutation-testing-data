  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Request timed out.')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the type of error thrown when a request times out, which could potentially cause the test suite to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Status Code: ${res.statusCode}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the error message thrown when a request fails, which could potentially cause the test suite to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Request failed.')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the error message thrown when a request fails, which could potentially cause the test suite to fail.

DONE.
