  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` returns a promise that is already resolved, whereas `Q.defer` returns a deferred object that can be resolved later.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer().promise` returns a promise that is already resolved, whereas `Q.defer` returns a deferred object that can be resolved later.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` returns a promise that is already rejected, whereas `Q.defer` returns a deferred object that can be resolved later.

DONE.
