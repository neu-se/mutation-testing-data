  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for the truthiness of `abort`. Replacing it with `true` would make the check always pass, even if `abort` is not set to a truthy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for the truthiness of `abort`. Replacing it with `1` would make the check always pass, even if `abort` is not set to a truthy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for the truthiness of `abort`. Replacing it with `!abort` would negate the value of `abort`, making the check always fail, even if `abort` is set to a truthy value.

DONE.
