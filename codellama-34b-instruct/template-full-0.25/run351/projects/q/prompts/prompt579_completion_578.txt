  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "throw", errback);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `errback` function would be called with the wrong number of arguments, which could cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "throw", function (exception) {
    return reject(exception);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `errback` function would be called with the wrong number of arguments, which could cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "throw", function (exception) {
    return reject(exception);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `errback` function would be called with the wrong number of arguments, which could cause an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
