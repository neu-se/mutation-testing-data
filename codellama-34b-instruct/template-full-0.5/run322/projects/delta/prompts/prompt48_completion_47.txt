  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType !== Object.keys(b)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when `embedType` is not equal to the first key in `b`, regardless of whether `b` has any keys or not. In the original code, the condition `!embedType` is checked first to ensure that `embedType` is not `null` or `undefined` before comparing it with the first key in `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(b).length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when `b` has no keys, regardless of whether `embedType` is equal to the first key or not. In the original code, the condition `!embedType` is checked first to ensure that `embedType` is not `null` or `undefined` before comparing it with the first key in `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
