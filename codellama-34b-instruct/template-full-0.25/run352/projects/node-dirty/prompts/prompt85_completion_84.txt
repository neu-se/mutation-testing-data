  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.split('\n')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the buffer into an array of lines, whereas the original code fragment would split the buffer into an array of strings using the newline character as the separator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the buffer into an array of individual characters, whereas the original code fragment would split the buffer into an array of strings using the newline character as the separator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.split(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the buffer into an array of strings using the null character as the separator, whereas the original code fragment would split the buffer into an array of strings using the newline character as the separator.

DONE.
