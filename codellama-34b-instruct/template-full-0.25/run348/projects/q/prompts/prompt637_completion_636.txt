  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"del"
```
This would result in different behavior because "del" is a different string than "delete".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"remove"
```
This would result in different behavior because "remove" is a different string than "delete".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete" + "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because "deletefoo" is a different string than "delete".

DONE.
