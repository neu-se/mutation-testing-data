  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method would be called with `null` as the reason for the rejection, which would not include the original error message or stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("Different error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method would be called with a new error object with a different error message, which could cause the error to be handled differently by the code that handles the rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.message = "Different error message"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method would be called with the original error object, but with a different error message. This could cause the error to be handled differently by the code that handles the rejection.

DONE.
