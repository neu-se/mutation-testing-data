  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val, row.key
```
This would result in different behavior because the key and value are swapped, which could cause the database to store the wrong data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key
```
This would result in different behavior because the value is not being stored, which could cause the database to lose data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val
```
This would result in different behavior because the key is not being stored, which could cause the database to lose data.

DONE.
