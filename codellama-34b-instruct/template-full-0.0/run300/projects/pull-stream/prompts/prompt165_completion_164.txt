  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)

This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function is called with the `cb` function as its first argument, which is not the intended behavior. The `abortCb` function is meant to be called with the `abort` and `onAbort` arguments as its first and second arguments, respectively.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
This would result in different behavior because the
