  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const compiled = compile(spec)
```
This would result in different behavior because `compile` returns an object with a `regex` property, but the original code fragment assigns the result of `compile` to `regex`, which is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const { regex, props } = compile(spec)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only uses the `regex` property of the returned object, but this code fragment uses the `props` property as well.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const { regex } = compile(spec)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment assigns the result of `compile` to `regex`, but this code fragment only uses the `regex` property of the returned object.

DONE.
