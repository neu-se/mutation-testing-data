  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the test is checking the real part of the complex number instead of the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the test is checking if the imaginary part is equal to 1 instead of 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the test is checking if the imaginary part is false instead of 0.

DONE.
