  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.next()` would call the `next()` method, which is not the intended behavior. The original code fragment was simply `this.next`, which was a reference to the `next` property of the `Iterator` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index]
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.ops[this.index]` would return the current `Op` object, whereas `this.next` would return the next `Op` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.index + 1` would return the next index in the `ops` array, whereas `this.next` would return the next `Op` object.

DONE.
