  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `matches` method would always return `false`, even if the `path` matches a rule.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `matches` method would always return `false`, even if the `path` matches a rule.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.path
```
This would result in different behavior because the `matches` method would check if the `path` matches the `ctx.path`, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
