  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(() => { })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately invoke the generator function without any arguments, which would likely cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invoke the generator function with a delay of 0 milliseconds, which could cause the generator to yield a different value or resolve the promise with a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator, 100)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invoke the generator function with a delay of 100 milliseconds, which could cause the generator to yield a different value or resolve the promise with a different value.

DONE.
