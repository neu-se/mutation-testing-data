  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT, which would invert the boolean value of `test`. If `test` is true, `!test` would be false, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is a logical AND, which would return false if either operand is false. If `test` is true, `test && false` would be false, but if `test` is false, `test && false` would be true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test || false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is a logical OR, which would return true if either operand is true. If `test` is true, `test || false` would be true, but if `test` is false, `test || false` would be false.

DONE.
