  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `'error'` event is called when the stream experiences an error, whereas the `'close'` event is called when the stream is closed, but the error event is not necessarily related to the closing of the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `'end'` event is called when the end of the stream is reached, whereas the `'close'` event is called when the stream is closed, but the end of the stream may not necessarily be reached when it is closed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finish'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `'finish'` event is called when the stream has finished processing its data, whereas the `'close'` event is called when the stream is closed, but the stream may not necessarily be finished processing its data when it is closed.

DONE.
