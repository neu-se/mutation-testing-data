 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the exception value would not be passed to the error handler, potentially causing the error to go unnoticed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the error handler would receive a boolean value instead of the actual exception, potentially causing confusion and making it harder to diagnose the issue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Error('Dummy error')
```
This would result in different behavior because a new error object would be created and passed to the error handler, which might not have the same stack trace as the original exception, making it harder to find the root cause of the issue.

DONE.
