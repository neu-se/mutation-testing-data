  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.path
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx.path` is a different value than `ctx`, and may not be a valid context for the policy evaluation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.verb
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx.verb` is a different value than `ctx`, and may not be a valid context for the policy evaluation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.name
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx.name` is a different value than `ctx`, and may not be a valid context for the policy evaluation.

DONE.
