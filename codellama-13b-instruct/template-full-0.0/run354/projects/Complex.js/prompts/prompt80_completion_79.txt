  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '+'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the current character is a plus sign, while the buggy code fragment checks if the current character is a plus sign and a space. This would cause the code to fail to parse complex numbers with a plus sign followed by a space, such as "1+ 2i".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '+' || c === ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the current character is a plus sign, while the buggy code fragment checks if the current character is a plus sign or a space. This would cause the code to parse complex numbers with a plus sign followed by a space, such as "1+ 2i", as if they were a single plus sign.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '+' || c === ' ' || c === '\t'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original
