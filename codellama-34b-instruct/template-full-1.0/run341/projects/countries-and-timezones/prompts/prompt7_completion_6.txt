  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of values in the object, whereas `Object.keys` returns an array of keys in the object. In the context of the code provided, using `Object.values` would result in the `buildTimezonesMap` function returning an array of arrays of timezones, rather than an array of objects with country codes as keys and timezones as values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries` returns an array of key-value pairs for the object, whereas `Object.keys` returns an array of keys. In the context of the code provided, using `Object.entries` would result in the `buildTimezonesMap` function returning an array of objects with country codes as keys and timezones as values, but also include the country codes as values in the nested arrays.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
