  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver().bind(null)
```
This change will cause the `makeNodeResolver` function to return a bound function, which will not have the same behavior as the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver().call(null)
```
This change will cause the `makeNodeResolver` function to return a function that will be called with `null` as the `this` value, which will not have the same behavior as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver().apply(null)
```
This change will cause the `makeNodeResolver` function to return a function that will be applied with `null` as the `this` value, which will not have the same behavior as the original code.

DONE.
