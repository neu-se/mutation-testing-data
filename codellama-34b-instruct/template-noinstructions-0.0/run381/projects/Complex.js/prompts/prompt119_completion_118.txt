  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(this['re'] / abs, this['im'] / abs);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abs` function is not defined in the code snippet provided, and it is not clear what the intended behavior of the `sign` method is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(this['re'] / abs, this['im'] / abs);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abs` function is not defined in the code snippet provided, and it is not clear what the intended behavior of the `sign` method is.
