  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFileSync)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFileSync` is a synchronous function, while `universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFile)` is an asynchronous function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFile.bind(fs))
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFile.bind(fs)` creates a new function that is bound to the `fs` object, while `universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFile)` creates a new function that is not bound to any object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFile.bind(null))
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFile.bind(null)` creates a new function that is bound to the `null` object, while `universalify.fromCallback(fs
