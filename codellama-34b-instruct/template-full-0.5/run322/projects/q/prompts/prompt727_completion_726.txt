  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deferred.resolve(promises)` line to be executed even if there are still pending promises, which could lead to a race condition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount === promises.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deferred.resolve(promises)` line to be executed only when all promises have been fulfilled, which could lead to a situation where the promise is never resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount >= promises.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deferred.resolve(promises)` line to be executed only when all promises have been fulfilled or rejected, which could lead to a situation where the promise is never resolved.

DONE.
