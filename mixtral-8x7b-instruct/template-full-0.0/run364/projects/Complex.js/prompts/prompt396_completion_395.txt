 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment divides by `d`, but the modified code fragment would always result in a zero for the second element of the Complex number, regardless of the value of `d`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not use `b` in the second element of the Complex number, but the modified code fragment would now divide by `b`, potentially causing a division by zero error if `b` is equal to zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not change the second element of the Complex number, but the modified code fragment would now introduce randomness, causing unpredictable results.

DONE.
