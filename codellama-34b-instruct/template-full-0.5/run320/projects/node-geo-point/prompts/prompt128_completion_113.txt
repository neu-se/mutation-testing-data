  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, point.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the latitude of the `point` object, while this replacement uses the longitude.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, point.latitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the latitude of the `point` object, while this replacement uses the latitude plus one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, point.longitude * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the longitude of the `point` object, while this replacement uses the longitude multiplied by two.

DONE.
