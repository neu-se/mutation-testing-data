  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deprecated === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deprecated` flag is now set to `false`, which means that the `deliverTimezones` function will return all timezones, including the deprecated ones.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deprecated !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deprecated` flag is now compared to `true` using the `!==` operator, which means that the `deliverTimezones` function will return all timezones that are not deprecated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deprecated === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deprecated` flag is now compared to `null`, which means that the `deliverTimezones` function will return all timezones that are not deprecated, as well as any timezones that have a `deprecated` property set to `null`.

DONE.
