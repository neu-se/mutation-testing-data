  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different substring of the original `part` string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different substring of the original `part` string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different substring of the original `part` string.

DONE.
