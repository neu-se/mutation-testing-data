  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength` returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, while `peekType` returns the type of the next operation. If the next operation is an insertion, `peekType` would return `'insert'`, while `peekLength` would return the length of the inserted text.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek` returns the next operation in the iterator, while `peekType` and `peekLength` return information about the next operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next
```
This would result in different behavior because `next` returns the next operation in the iterator and advances the iterator to the next operation, while `peekType` and `peekLength` return information about the next operation without advancing the iterator.

DONE.
