  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < Complex['EPSILON']
```
This change will cause the `toString` method to return a different result for complex numbers with a real part that is very close to zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(a) <= Complex['EPSILON']
```
This change will cause the `toString` method to return a different result for complex numbers with a real part that is very close to zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(a) < Complex['EPSILON'] * 2
```
This change will cause the `toString` method to return a different result for complex numbers with a real part that is very close to zero.

DONE.
