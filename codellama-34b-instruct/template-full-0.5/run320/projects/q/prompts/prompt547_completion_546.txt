  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a function that resolves a promise, while `reject` is a function that rejects a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Error")
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw new Error("Error")` will throw an error, while `reject` will reject a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because `return Q.reject(exception)` will return a rejected promise, while `reject` will reject a promise.

DONE.
