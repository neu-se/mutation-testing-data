  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `cos` is the cosine function, whereas `cosh` is the hyperbolic cosine function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
imAnd
```
This would result in different behavior because `cimAnd` is the imaginary part of the result of `a` concatenated with the result of `b`, whereas `cosh` is the hyperbolic cosine function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `a / 0` would result in a division by zero error, whereas `cosh` would return a valid value.

DONE.
