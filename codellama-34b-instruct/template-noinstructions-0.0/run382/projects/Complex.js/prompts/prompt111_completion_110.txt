  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` function checks if a value is NaN, and the `!` operator negates the result, so `!isNaN` would return `true` if the value is not NaN, and `false` if it is NaN.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite` function checks if a value is a finite number, and it would return `true` if the value is a finite number, and `false` if it is not a finite number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Number.isNaN` function checks if a value is NaN, and it would return `true` if the value is NaN, and `false` if it is not NaN.

DONE.
