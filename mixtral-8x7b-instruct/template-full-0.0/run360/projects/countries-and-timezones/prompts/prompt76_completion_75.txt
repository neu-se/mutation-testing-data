 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for null values explicitly, which might not cover cases where timezone is undefined or any other falsy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for undefined values explicitly, which might not cover cases where timezone is null or any other falsy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(timezone).length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the timezone object is empty, which might not cover cases where timezone is not an object or has properties but their values are falsy.

DONE.
