  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isNaN()` function to return `true`, allowing the `Complex['NAN']` constant to be returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isInfinite()` function to return `false`, preventing the `Complex['INFINITY']` constant from being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isNaN()` function to return `true`, allowing the `Complex['NAN']` constant to be returned.

DONE.
