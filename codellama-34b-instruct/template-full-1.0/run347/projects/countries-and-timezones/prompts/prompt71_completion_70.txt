  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name).toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the timezone name to uppercase, which could cause the `getTimezone` function to return a different timezone than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name.toUpperCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the timezone name to uppercase before passing it to the `buildTimezone` function, which could cause the function to return a different timezone than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name + 'extra')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 'extra'` would concatenate the string 'extra' to the end of the timezone name, which could cause the `getTimezone` function to return a different timezone than expected.

DONE.
