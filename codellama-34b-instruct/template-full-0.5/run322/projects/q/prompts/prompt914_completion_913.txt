  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an array, and the `array_slice` function would return an empty array instead of a slice of the original arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not an array, and the `array_slice` function would return an empty array instead of a slice of the original arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array would be passed to the `nodeArgs.push` method, which would not have the same effect as passing the original `arguments` object.

DONE.
