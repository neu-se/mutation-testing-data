  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error('Custom error message')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits the error object as the second argument to the event handler, while this code fragment creates a new error object with a custom message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits the error object as the second argument to the event handler, while this code fragment does not emit any error object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits the error object as the second argument to the event handler, while this code fragment does not emit any error object.

DONE.
