  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` returns the sine of the input value, whereas `Math.cos` returns the cosine. This would cause the complex cosh function to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` returns the square root of the input value, whereas `Math.cos` returns the cosine. This would cause the complex cosh function to return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log10
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log10` returns the logarithm of the input value with base 10, whereas `Math.cos` returns the cosine. This would cause the complex cosh function to return incorrect results.

DONE.
