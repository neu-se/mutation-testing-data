  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end, data` passes the `end` and `data` arguments to the `cb` function, while the modified code fragment `end, null` passes `end` and `null` to the `cb` function, which could cause the test to fail if the `cb` function expects a non-null value for the `data` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end, data` passes the `end` and `data` arguments to the `cb` function, while the modified code fragment `end, undefined` passes `end` and `undefined` to the `cb` function, which could cause the test to fail if the `cb` function expects a defined value for the `data` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, 'foo'
```
This would result in different
