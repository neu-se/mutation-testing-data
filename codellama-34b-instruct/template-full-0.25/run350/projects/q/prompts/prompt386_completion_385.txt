  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fcall` method is not defined on the `callback` object, so it would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method is not defined on the `callback` object, so it would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is not defined on the `callback` object, so it would throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
