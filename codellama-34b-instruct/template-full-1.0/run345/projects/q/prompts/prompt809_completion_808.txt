  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!callback || typeof callback !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `callback` is not a function, rather than checking if it is not a function or if it does not have the `apply` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!callback || callback.apply !== Function.prototype.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `apply` method of `callback` is not the same as the `apply` method of the `Function` prototype, rather than checking if it is not a function or if it does not have the `apply` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!callback || callback.apply === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `apply` method of `callback` is a string, rather than checking if it is not a function or if it does not have the `apply` method.

DONE.
