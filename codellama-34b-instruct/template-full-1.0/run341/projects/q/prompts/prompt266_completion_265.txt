  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because when the `resolvedPromise` variable is set to `true`, the `become` method would not be called, as the `if` statement would evaluate to `true`, and the `become` method would only be called if `resolvedPromise` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `become` method would only be called if `resolvedPromise` is `false`, which would cause the promise to be resolved with a rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `become` method would only be called if `resolvedPromise` is falsy, which would cause the promise to be resolved with a rejection.

DONE.
