  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a promise, and `fulfill` expects a promise as its argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a promise, and `fulfill` expects a promise as its argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject("error")
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` returns a rejected promise, and `fulfill` expects a resolved promise as its argument.

DONE.
