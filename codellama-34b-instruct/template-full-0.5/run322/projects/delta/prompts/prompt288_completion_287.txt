  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` is a method that retains the current value of `line`, whereas `push` adds a new value to the end of `line`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a method that deletes the current value of `line`, whereas `push` adds a new value to the end of `line`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` is a method that inserts a new value into `line`, whereas `push` adds a new value to the end of `line`.

DONE.
