 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'di', 'dice'
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an incorrect rule for the word 'die' changing its plural form to 'dice'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/^dice$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an incorrect rule for the word 'dice' which already has a correct plural form, thus appending an extra 's' to it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'x', function(w) { return w + 'es' }
