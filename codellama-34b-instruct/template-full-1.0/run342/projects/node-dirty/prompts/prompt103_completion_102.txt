  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the value `"foo"` is a constant string, whereas `row.key` is a variable that is expected to hold a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val
```
This would result in different behavior because `row.val` is a variable that holds the value associated with the key, whereas `"foo"` is a constant string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(row.key)
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify(row.key)` would stringify the key, whereas `"foo"` is a constant string.

DONE.
