  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.call(null, "next")
```
This would result in different behavior because `continuer.call(null, "next")` would call the `continuer` function with `this` set to `null` and the argument `"next"`, whereas the original code `continuer, "next"` would pass `continuer` as the first argument to `bind`, and `"next"` as the second argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nextTick
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nextTick` is a different function than `continuer`, and would likely have a different implementation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, and would likely cause an error or exception to be thrown.

DONE.
