  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (cb) cb
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function regardless of whether it is defined or not, whereas the original code only calls `cb` if it is defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (cb) cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with no arguments, whereas the original code calls it with no arguments only if it is defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (cb) cb = null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `cb` function to `null` if it is defined, whereas the original code does not modify the `cb` function.

DONE.
