  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unhandledReasons.splice` method would not be called, and the `unhandledReasons` array would not be modified.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unhandledReasons.splice` method would be called with a negative index, which would result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_indexOf(unhandledRejections, promise) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unhandledReasons.splice` method would be called with an incorrect index, which would result in an error.

DONE.
