  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== b[key]
```
This change will cause the `diff` function to return a different result than the original code, as it will not check for deep equality between the two objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== b[key] && a[key] !== null
```
This change will cause the `diff` function to return a different result than the original code, as it will not check for deep equality between the two objects and will also ignore null values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual(a[key], b[key]) && a[key] !== null
```
This change will cause the `diff` function to return a different result than the original code, as it will not check for deep equality between the two objects and will also ignore null values.

DONE.
