  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `_has_illegal_chars` is called with the `baseUrlStr` argument, which is not the same as the `currentUrlStr` argument that is passed to the function in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!_has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation operator `!` is added to the function call, which would cause the function to return the opposite value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function is called with the `currentUrlStr` argument, which is not the same as the `baseUrlStr` argument that is passed to the function in the original code.

DONE.
