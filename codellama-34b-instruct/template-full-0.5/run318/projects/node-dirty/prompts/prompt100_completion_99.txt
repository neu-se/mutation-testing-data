  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(`Could not load corrupted row: ${rowStr}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error if the row is corrupted, whereas the original code would emit an error event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(`Could not load corrupted row: ${rowStr}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error if the row is corrupted, whereas the original code would emit an error event.
