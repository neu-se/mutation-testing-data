  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `abort` variable, causing the `abortCb` function to be called with a different value than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator adds 1 to the `abort` variable, causing the `abortCb` function to be called with a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operator subtracts 1 from the `abort` variable, causing the `abortCb` function to be called with a different value than the original code.

DONE.
