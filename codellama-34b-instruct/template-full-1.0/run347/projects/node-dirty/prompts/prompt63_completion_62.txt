  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because null is not a valid value for the `writeStream` property, and the program would throw an error when attempting to access the `end` property of `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because `1` is not a valid value for the `writeStream` property, and the program would throw an error when attempting to access the `end` property of `1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object and does not have an `end` property, and the program would throw an error when attempting to access the `end` property of an empty object.

DONE.
