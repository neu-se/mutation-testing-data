  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value would be incremented by 1, which would affect the program's output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value would be multiplied by 2, which would affect the program's output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value would be decremented by 1, which would affect the program's output.

DONE.
