Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!thisIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the condition, causing the loop to execute when there are no more operations to iterate over, potentially leading to incorrect processing of the `Delta` operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check for a specific operation type instead of whether there are more operations to process, which could lead to skipping valid operations and incorrect transformations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.hasNext() && otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it requires both iterators to have next operations available to continue the loop, which could prematurely terminate the loop if one of the iterators runs out of operations, leading to incomplete transformations.

DONE.
