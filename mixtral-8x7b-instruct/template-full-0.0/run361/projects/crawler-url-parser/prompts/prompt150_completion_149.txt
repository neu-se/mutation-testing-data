 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
""
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty string would not properly split the URL path into parts, causing incorrect comparisons in the `gettype` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new RegExp('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because using a regular expression instead of a string literal would change the behavior of the `split` method, potentially causing incorrect comparisons in the `gettype` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"/".concat(String.fromCharCode(0))
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a null character to the string, which would not be properly handled by the `split` method, causing incorrect comparisons in the `gettype` function.

DONE.
