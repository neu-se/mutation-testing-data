  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return "Hello World!"; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a string instead of a function, which would cause the code to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return 42; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a number instead of a function, which would cause the code to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return undefined instead of a function, which would cause the code to fail.

DONE.
