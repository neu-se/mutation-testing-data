  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a simple variable reference, while the replacement code fragment is an addition operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a simple variable reference, while the replacement code fragment is a different variable reference.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a simple variable reference, while the replacement code fragment is a multiplication operation.

DONE.
