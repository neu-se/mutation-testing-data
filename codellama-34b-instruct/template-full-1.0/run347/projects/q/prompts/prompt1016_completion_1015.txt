  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(null));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array would not have the same length as the original code, which could impact the behavior of the `dispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(1));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array would have an extra element than the original code, which could impact the behavior of the `dispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(function() {}));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array would have a different element at the specified index than the original code, which could impact the behavior of the `dispatch` method.

DONE.
