  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds an 's' to the end of the word, while this new code fragment adds an 'es'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds an 's' to the end of the word, while this new code fragment adds an 'ies'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'y' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds an 's' to the end of the word, while this new code fragment adds a 'y'.

DONE.
