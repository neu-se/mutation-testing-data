  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src + "
```
This would result in different behavior because the `src` variable is now a string, and the `directory()` method expects a path to a directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `src` variable is now a number, and the `directory()` method expects a path to a directory.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src + "../"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `src` variable is now a path to the parent directory, and the `directory()` method expects a path to the current directory.

DONE.
