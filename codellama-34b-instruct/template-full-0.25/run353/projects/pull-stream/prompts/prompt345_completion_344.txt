  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === false ? null : abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `abort` is `true`, but this replacement checks if it's `false`. If `abort` is `true`, the original code fragment would return `null`, but this replacement would return `abort`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === null ? null : abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `abort` is `true`, but this replacement checks if it's `null`. If `abort` is `null`, the original code fragment would return `null`, but this replacement would return `abort`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === undefined ? null : abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `abort` is `true`, but this replacement checks if it's `undefined`. If `abort` is `undefined
