  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isInternalFrame` function to return `true` for any stack trace that contains the name of the file where the `Q` function is defined, regardless of the line number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isInternalFrame` function to return `true` for any stack trace that contains the line number where the `Q` function is defined, regardless of the file name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isInternalFrame` function to return `true` for any stack trace that contains the column number where the `Q` function is defined, regardless of the file name and line number.

DONE.
