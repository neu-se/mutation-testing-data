  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.toString(<PLACEHOLDER>) === "[object process]"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString` method is not guaranteed to return a string representation of the object that contains the word "process".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.toString(<PLACEHOLDER>) === "[object Object]"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString` method is not guaranteed to return a string representation of the object that contains the word "Object".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.toString(<PLACEHOLDER>) === "[object Node]"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString` method is not guaranteed to return a string representation of the object that contains the word "Node".

DONE.
