  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The options.url is required')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, and the test would not catch the missing `dest` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The options.dest is required')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be the same as the original code, and the test would still catch the missing `dest` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The options.dest is required')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be the same as the original code, and the test would still catch the missing `dest` property.

DONE.
