 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the opposite result, potentially causing tests to pass even when they should fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the test function to a string, which would not have the same behavior as the original test function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test || function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the test function with an empty function when test is falsy, potentially causing tests to pass even when they should fail.

DONE.
