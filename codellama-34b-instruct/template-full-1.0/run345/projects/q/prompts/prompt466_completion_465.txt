  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport != -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the not equal operator will always evaluate to true if `atReport` is not equal to -1, regardless of the value of `reportedUnhandledRejections`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the greater than operator will always evaluate to true if `atReport` is greater than -1, regardless of the value of `reportedUnhandledRejections`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport < reportedUnhandledRejections.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the less than operator will evaluate to true if `atReport` is less than the length of `reportedUnhandledRejections`, regardless of the value of `reportedUnhandledRejections`.

DONE.
