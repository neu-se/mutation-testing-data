  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that rejects the promise with the given reason, whereas `fulfill` is a function that fulfills the promise with the given value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfill(otherValue)
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherValue` is a different value than `value`, and the promise would be fulfilled with a different value than the one that was expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfill(value + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be fulfilled with a different value than the one that was expected, specifically the value of `value + 1`.

DONE.
