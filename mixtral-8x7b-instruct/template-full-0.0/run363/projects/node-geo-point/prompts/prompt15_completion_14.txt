 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(<any>point).coordinates
```
This would result in different behavior because it bypasses type checking and allows any property to be accessed, even if the object does not have a `coordinates` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
point['cooordinates']
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the `coordinates` property as a string key, which would not find the property if it is not defined with a string key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
point.coordinates || []
