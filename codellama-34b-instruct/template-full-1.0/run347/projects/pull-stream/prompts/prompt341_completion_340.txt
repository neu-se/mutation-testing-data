  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!seen[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the boolean value of `seen[key]`, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false` regardless of the input data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsey value, so the `if` statement would always evaluate to `true` and the `seen` object would never be updated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsey value, so the `if` statement would always evaluate to `true` and the `seen` object would never be updated.

DONE.
