  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.denodeify.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a different method than `apply`, and it would change the way the function is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.denodeify.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` is a different method than `apply`, and it would change the way the function is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.denodeify.apply.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` and `bind` are different methods, and it would change the way the function is called.

DONE.
