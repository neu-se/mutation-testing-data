  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` would cause the promise to be rejected, rather than resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("reject", [])
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` would cause the promise to be rejected, rather than resolved. Additionally, the `[]` argument would be passed to the `reject` method, which may not be intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("resolve", [])
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` would cause the promise to be resolved, rather than rejected. Additionally, the `[]` argument would be passed to the `resolve` method, which may not be intended.

DONE.
