  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `policy` is a reference to a `Policy` object, while `null` is a null reference. This change would cause the `push` method to set the value of the map entry to `null` instead of a `Policy` object, which could potentially cause errors in the code that uses the `PolicyMap`.

DONE.
