  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.error, callback, errback
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.error` is not a valid property of the `result` object, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value, callback, errback, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the extra `null` argument would cause the `errback` function to be called with an additional `null` argument, which could cause it to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value, callback, errback, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the extra `undefined` argument would cause the `errback` function to be called with an additional `undefined` argument, which could cause it to behave differently.

DONE.
