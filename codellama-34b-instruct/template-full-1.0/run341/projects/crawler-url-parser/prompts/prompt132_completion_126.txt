  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]/.test
```
This would result in different behavior because `.test` is a function that returns a boolean, while `/\/default\.[a-z]+$/` is a regular expression that matches a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^\/]*/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/[^\/]*/i` matches any character that is not a forward slash, while `/\/default\.[a-z]+$/` matches a specific sequence of characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\./i + "pdf"
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/\/default\./i` matches the string "default", while `/\/default\.[a-z]+$/` matches the string "default" followed by at least one character that is not a forward slash.

DONE.
