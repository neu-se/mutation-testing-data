 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to check for 'delete' operations instead of 'insert' operations, potentially skipping or processing the wrong operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the function call with the number 1, causing a syntax error and preventing the code from executing properly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peek().type
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the 'type' property of the first operation in the iterator instead of checking the type of operation, potentially causing the loop to behave unexpectedly or throw an error if the 'type' property is not defined.

DONE.
