  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [id]: getTimezone(id, options) }
```
This would result in different behavior because `getTimezone` and `getCountry` have different return types, and the code assumes that the return value of `getCountry` is an object with a `timezones` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [id]: getCountry(id, options).timezones }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `timezones` property of the country object, rather than the country object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [id]: getCountry(id, options).allTimezones }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `allTimezones` property of the country object, rather than the `timezones` property.

DONE.
