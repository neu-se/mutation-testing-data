  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` iterator to be used instead of the `thisIter` iterator, which could lead to unexpected results in the `compose` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `compose` method to return a `Delta` object with a `null` value, which could lead to errors or unexpected behavior in the code that uses the `compose` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `compose` method to return a `Delta` object with an `undefined` value, which could lead to errors or unexpected behavior in the code that uses the `compose` method.

DONE.
