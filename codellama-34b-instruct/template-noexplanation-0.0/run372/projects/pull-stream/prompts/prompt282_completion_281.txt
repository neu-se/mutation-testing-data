  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This change will cause the `mapper` function to be called with a different argument than the original code, which may reveal a weakness in the test suite if it is not able to detect this change.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data * 2
```
This change will also cause the `mapper` function to be called with a different argument than the original code, and may also reveal a weakness in the test suite if it is not able to detect this change.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This change will cause the `mapper` function to be called with a different argument than the original code, and may also reveal a weakness in the test suite if it is not able to detect this change.

DONE.
