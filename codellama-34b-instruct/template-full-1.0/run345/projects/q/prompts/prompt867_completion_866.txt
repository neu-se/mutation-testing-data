  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null, {})
```
This would result in different behavior because "deferred.makeNodeResolver" is called with the wrong number of arguments, and the callback function would be called with the wrong arguments, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(function () { })
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would not receive the expected arguments, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver("", {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would receive the wrong number of arguments, leading to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
