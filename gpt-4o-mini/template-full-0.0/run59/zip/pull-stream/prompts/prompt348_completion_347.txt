Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `test.test` is strictly equal to `null`, which will always return `false` if `test.test` is a function, thus bypassing the intended functionality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test()
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to invoke `test.test` as a function, which may lead to runtime errors if `test.test` is not designed to be called without arguments or if it does not return a valid value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to perform an arithmetic operation on `test.test`, which is a function, leading to a type coercion that will not yield the expected behavior of the original code.

DONE.
