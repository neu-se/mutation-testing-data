  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return the first argument passed to it, rather than the second argument as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return the third argument passed to it, rather than the second argument as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[length-1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return the last argument passed to it, rather than the second argument as intended.

DONE.
