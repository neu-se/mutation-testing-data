  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `baseUrl.toString()`

This would result in different behavior because `URL.parse` expects a string as an input but `baseUrl.toString()` would be a string representing the URL object.
```
let currentUrl = parse(href, baseUrl.toString());
```
Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `baseUrl.href`

This would result in different behavior because `baseUrl.href` is the full URL including the protocol and hostname, while `currentUrl.url` is the full URL excluding the protocol and hostname.
```
let currentUrl = parse(href, baseUrl.href);
```
Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `baseUrl`

This would result in different behavior because baseUrl is not a string, but an object containing information about the base URL such as protocol, hostname, pathname, search, hash.
```
let currentUrl = parse(href, baseUrl);
```
Third Option: DONE.
