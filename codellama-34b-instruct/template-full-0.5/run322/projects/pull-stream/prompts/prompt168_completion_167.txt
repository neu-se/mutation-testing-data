  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort()
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort` is a function, and calling it would execute the code inside the function, whereas the original code fragment just references the function without calling it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort.call(this)` would call the `onAbort` function with `this` set to the current object, whereas the original code fragment does not specify a `this` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort.call(null)` would call the `onAbort` function with `this` set to `null`, whereas the original code fragment does not specify a `this` value.

DONE.
