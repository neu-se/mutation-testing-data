  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.split('\n')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the buffer into an array of strings using the newline character as the separator, while the new code fragment splits the buffer into an array of strings using the null character as the separator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the buffer into an array of strings using the newline character as the separator, while the new code fragment splits the buffer into an array of strings using the empty string as the separator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.split(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the buffer into an array of strings using the newline character as the separator, while the new code fragment splits the buffer into an array of strings using the null character as the separator.

DONE.
