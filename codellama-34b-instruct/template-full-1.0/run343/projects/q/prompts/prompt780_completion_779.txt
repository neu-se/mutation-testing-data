  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `onProgress` would not be called, and the promise would not be notified of progress.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `onProgress` would be called with `undefined` as an argument, which may cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because `onProgress` would be called with `false` as an argument, which may cause an error.

DONE.
