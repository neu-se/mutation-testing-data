  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a callback function that is called when the data is persisted, while the new code fragment `() => {}` is an empty function that does nothing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a callback function that is called when the data is persisted, while the new code fragment `undefined` is a value that is not a function and will not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a callback function that is called when the data is persisted, while the new code fragment `null` is a value that is not a function and will not be called.

DONE.
