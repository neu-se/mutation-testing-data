  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method with an argument would advance the iterator by the specified number of positions, rather than just one position as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(thisIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method with an argument would advance the iterator by the length of the current element, rather than just one position as in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(thisIter.peekLength() + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method with an argument would advance the iterator by the length of the current element plus one position, rather than just one position as in the original code.

DONE.
