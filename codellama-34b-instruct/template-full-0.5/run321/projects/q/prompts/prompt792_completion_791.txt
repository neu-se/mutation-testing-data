  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the value `null`, instead of `rejected`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the string `"rejected"`, instead of the value of the `rejected` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, function () { return rejected; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the return value of the `rejected` function, instead of the value of the `rejected` variable.

DONE.
