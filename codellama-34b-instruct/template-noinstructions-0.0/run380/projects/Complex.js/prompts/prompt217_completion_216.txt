  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] * loh + z['im'] * arg
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the subtraction operator, while this replacement uses the addition operator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] * loh - z['im'] * arg + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not have the extra `+ 1` term.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] * loh - z['im'] * arg * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the multiplication operator, while this replacement uses the power operator.

DONE.
