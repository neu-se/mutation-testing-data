  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush()
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush()` is a function that is not defined in the code snippet, and it would cause a ReferenceError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush(undefined)` is a function call with a different argument than the original code, and it would cause a TypeError.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush(null)` is a function call with a different argument than the original code, and it would cause a TypeError.

DONE.
