  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { throw new Error("Q is not defined"); }
```
This code fragment will throw an error when the `Q` function is called, indicating that the `Q` function is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return "Q"; }
```
This code fragment will return the string "Q" when the `Q` function is called, which is not the expected behavior of the `Q` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return undefined; }
```
This code fragment will return `undefined` when the `Q` function is called, which is not the expected behavior of the `Q` function.

DONE.
