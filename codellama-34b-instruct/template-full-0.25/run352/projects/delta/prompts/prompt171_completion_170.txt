  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.max` returns the largest of two numbers, while `Math.min` returns the smallest.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the length of the string, which could result in a negative value if the length is 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the length of the string, which could result in a different output.

DONE.
