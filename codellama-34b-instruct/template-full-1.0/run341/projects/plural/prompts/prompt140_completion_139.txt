  I've completed a mutation test on the code you provided. The results are as follows:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return 42, regardless of the input string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return null, regardless of the input string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return Math.random() }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return a random value, regardless of the input string.

DONE.
