  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `otherOp.retain` value is incremented by 1, which would cause the `compose` method to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `otherOp.retain` value is decremented by 1, which would cause the `compose` method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `otherOp.retain` value is multiplied by 2, which would cause the `compose` method to return a different result.

DONE.
