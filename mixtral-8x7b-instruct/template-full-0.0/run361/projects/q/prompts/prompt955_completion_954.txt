 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
eval('bound').fapply
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a security vulnerability by allowing arbitrary code execution. The `eval` function executes the provided string as JavaScript code, which can lead to unintended consequences and should be avoided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
bound.fapply
```
This would result in different behavior because it assumes that `fapply` is a property of the `bound` function, which is not the case. This would lead to a `TypeError` when attempting to access the non-existent property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Function.prototype.fapply
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to access the `fapply` property from the `Function.prototype` object, which is not present. This would lead to a `TypeError` when attempting to access the non-existent property.

DONE.
