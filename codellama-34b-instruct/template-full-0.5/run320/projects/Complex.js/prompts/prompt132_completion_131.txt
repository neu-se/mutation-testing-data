  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>) && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the first `isInfinite` call would always return `false` if the argument is `undefined`, whereas the second `isInfinite` call would return `true` if the argument is `Infinity`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the first `isInfinite` call would always return `false` if the argument is `undefined`, whereas the second `isInfinite` call would return `true` if the argument is `Infinity`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()
