  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the first element of the `nodeArgs` array as the first argument to `ops.dispatch` instead of passing the entire `nodeArgs` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the length of the `nodeArgs` array as the first argument to `ops.dispatch` instead of passing the entire `nodeArgs` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the elements of the `nodeArgs` array starting from the second element as the first argument to `ops.dispatch` instead of passing the entire `nodeArgs` array.

DONE.
