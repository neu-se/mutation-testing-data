  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'typee'
```
This would result in different behavior because the property name is misspelled, causing the `hasOwnProperty` method to return `false` even if the property exists.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'type' + 'e'
```
This would result in different behavior because the property name is concatenated with the string `'e'`, causing the `hasOwnProperty` method to return `false` even if the property exists.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'type' + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the property name is concatenated with the number `1`, causing the `hasOwnProperty` method to return `false` even if the property exists.

DONE.
