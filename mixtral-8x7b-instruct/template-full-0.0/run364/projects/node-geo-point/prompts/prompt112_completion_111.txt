 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause division by zero when the latitude is 90 or -90 degrees, which would not happen with the original `Math.tan` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp` returns the exponential value of a number, which is not the same as the tangent function. This would cause the `toTile` method to return incorrect tile coordinates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan` returns the arctangent of a number, which is not the same as the tangent function. This would cause the `toTile` method to return incorrect tile coordinates.

DONE.
