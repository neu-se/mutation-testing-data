 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Array.from(this.entries()).find(([name, _policy]) => name === policy.name)?.set
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `Array.from()` to create an array of entries, then `find()` to locate the entry with the matching policy name, and finally attempts to call the `set` method on the second element of the found entry. This is different from the original code, which directly calls the `set` method on the `this` object (the `PolicyMap` instance).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.get(policy.name)?.set
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `get` method to retrieve the policy by name and then attempts to call the `set` method on the returned policy. This is different from the original code, which directly calls the `set` method on the `this` object (the `PolicyMap` instance).
