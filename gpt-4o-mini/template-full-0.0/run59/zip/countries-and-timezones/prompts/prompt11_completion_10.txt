Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] = { current: [], all: [] };
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly assigns a new object to `result[country]`, which would overwrite any existing data for that country instead of merging it with the existing properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] = { current: [id], all: [] };
```
This would result in different behavior because it initializes `result[country].current` with the current timezone ID instead of an empty array, potentially leading to incorrect data if the country already has existing timezones.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] = { current: [], all: [id] };
```
This would result in different behavior because it initializes `result[country].all` with the current timezone ID instead of pushing it to the existing array, which would cause the `all` array to only contain the last added timezone ID for that country.

DONE.
