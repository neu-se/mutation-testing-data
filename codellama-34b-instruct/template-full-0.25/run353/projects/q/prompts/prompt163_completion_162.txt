  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would no longer split the stack trace into separate lines.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\t"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would split the stack trace into separate lines, but with a different delimiter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\r\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would split the stack trace into separate lines, but with a different delimiter.

DONE.
