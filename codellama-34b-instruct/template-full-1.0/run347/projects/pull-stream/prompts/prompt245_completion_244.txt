  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!err && !abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has short-circuit evaluation, meaning that if `err` is truthy, `abort` is not evaluated. However, the new code fragment does not have short-circuit evaluation, so even if `err` is truthy, `abort` will still be evaluated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err && abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only aborts the current stream if `err` is truthy, while the new code fragment aborts both the current stream and the stream of streams.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err || abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only aborts the current stream if `err` is truthy, while the new code fragment aborts both the current stream and the stream of streams if `err` is falsy.

DONE.
