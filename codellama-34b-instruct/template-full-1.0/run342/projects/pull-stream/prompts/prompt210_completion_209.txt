  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because `aborted` is a local variable that contains the abort error, while `cb` is the callback function that is passed as an argument to the `asyncMap` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, while `cb` is a function that is expected to be called with the abort error if there is one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, while `cb` is a function that is expected to be called with the abort error if there is one.

DONE.
