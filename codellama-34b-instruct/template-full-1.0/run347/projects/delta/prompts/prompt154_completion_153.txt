  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: ```thisIter.next(length);``` This would result in different behavior because the `length` variable is undefined, and this code fragment would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: ```else: self.peekType() === 'insert' ``` This would result in different behavior because the `peekType()` method checks whether the next op in the sequence is of type "insert", but in this code fragment, `self` is not defined, and the code would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: ```if (other.peekLength() > 0): else ``` This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength()` method checks the length of the next op in the sequence, but in this code fragment, `other` is not defined, and the code would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
