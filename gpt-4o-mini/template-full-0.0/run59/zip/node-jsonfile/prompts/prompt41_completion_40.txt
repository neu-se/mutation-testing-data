Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly calls a synchronous version of the write function instead of the intended asynchronous version, potentially leading to unexpected blocking behavior in the application.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly references the `fs` module's synchronous write method instead of using the `_writeFile` function, which may not handle options or errors in the same way.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_writeFile.bind(null, file, obj)
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly binds the `_writeFile` function to the current context with the `file` and `obj` arguments, effectively turning it into a non-promise returning function, which could lead to unhandled promise rejections.

DONE.
