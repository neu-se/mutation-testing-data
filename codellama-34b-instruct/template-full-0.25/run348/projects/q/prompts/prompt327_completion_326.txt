  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the first argument of the `fallback` function as the second argument to the `promiseDispatch` method, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the second argument of the `fallback` function as the second argument to the `promiseDispatch` method, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the third argument of the `fallback` function as the second argument to the `promiseDispatch` method, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
