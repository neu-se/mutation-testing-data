  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would cause the `concat` method to return a `Delta` object with the concatenated ops, while the replaced code fragment would return a `Delta` object with only the first op.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would cause the `concat` method to return a `Delta` object with the concatenated ops, while the replaced code fragment would return a `Delta` object with only the last op.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would cause the `concat` method to return a `Delta` object with the concatenated ops, while the replaced code fragment would return a `Delta` object with only the second op.

DONE.
