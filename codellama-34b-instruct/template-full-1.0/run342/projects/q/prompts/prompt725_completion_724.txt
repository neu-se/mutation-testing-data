  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.state
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.state` might not exist or might return a different value than `promise.inspect`, leading to different execution paths and potentially different outcomes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise["state"]
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise["state"]` might not exist or might return a different value than `promise.inspect`, leading to different execution paths and potentially different outcomes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect << 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.inspect << 1` would shift the `inspect` property to the left by 1 bit, potentially changing its value and leading to different execution paths and outcomes.

DONE.
