  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(function (value) {
    clearTimeout(timeoutId);
    deferred.resolve(value);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the value returned by `then`, rather than the value returned by `allSettled`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(function (value) {
    clearTimeout(timeoutId);
    deferred.reject(value);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the value returned by `then`, rather than the value returned by `allSettled`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(function (value) {
    clearTimeout(timeoutId);
    return value;
