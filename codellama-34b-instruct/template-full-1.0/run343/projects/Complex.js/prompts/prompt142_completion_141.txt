  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `this['im'] === NaN && z['im'] === NaN`. This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment tests whether `this['im']` and `z['im']` are both equal to 0, but the new code fragment tests whether they are both `NaN`, which is a different condition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `a + b === NaN && c - d === NaN`. This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment tests whether `a + b` and `c - d` are both equal to 0, but the new code fragment tests whether they are both `NaN`, which is a different condition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `this['re'] === NaN && z['re'] === NaN`. This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment tests whether `this['re']` and `z['re']` are both equal to 0, but the new code fragment tests whether they are both `NaN`, which is a different condition.

DONE.
