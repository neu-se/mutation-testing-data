  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
++read
```
This would result in different behavior because `++read` would increment the value of `read` before passing it as an argument to `pull`, whereas the original code passes the value of `read` as-is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `read + 1` would add 1 to the value of `read` before passing it as an argument to `pull`, whereas the original code passes the value of `read` as-is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid value to pass as an argument to `pull`, whereas the original code passes the value of `read` as-is.

DONE.
