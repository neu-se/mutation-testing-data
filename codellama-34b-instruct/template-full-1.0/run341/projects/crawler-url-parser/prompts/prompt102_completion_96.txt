  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.baseurl
```
This would result in different behavior because `currentUrl.baseurl` is a string and `currentUrl.url` is a `URL` object, and the code assumes that the `Map.set()` method is adding URLs to the map, not strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url.href
```
This would result in different behavior because `currentUrl.url.href` is a string and `currentUrl.url` is a `URL` object, and the code assumes that the `Map.set()` method is adding URLs to the map, not strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url.path
```
This would result in different behavior because `currentUrl.url.path` is a string and `currentUrl.url` is a `URL` object, and the code assumes that the `Map.set()` method is adding URLs to the map, not strings.

DONE
