  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseFloat(c) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `parseFloat(c)` would return a floating-point number, while the modified code fragment `parseFloat(c) + 1` would return a floating-point number plus 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(parseFloat(c))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `parseFloat(c)` would return a floating-point number, while the modified code fragment `Math.floor(parseFloat(c))` would return the largest integer less than or equal to the floating-point number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseFloat(c).toFixed(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `parseFloat(c)` would return a floating-point number, while the modified code fragment `parseFloat(c).toFixed(2)` would return a string representation of the
