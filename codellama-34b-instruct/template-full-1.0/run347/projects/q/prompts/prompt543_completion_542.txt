  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void array
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method expects a `this` argument as the first parameter, but `void 0` is not a valid object. Using `void array` would pass `array` as `this` but since `array` is also passed as the second argument, the receiver (`this`) of the `apply` method would no longer be `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method expects a function as the first parameter, but `null` is not a function. Using `null` would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method expects a function as the first parameter, but `this` is not a function. Using `this` would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

DONE.
