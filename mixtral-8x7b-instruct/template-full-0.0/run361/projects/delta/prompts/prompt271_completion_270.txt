 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
< PLACEHOLDER
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the iterator has a previous element instead of a next one, potentially causing the loop to terminate prematurely or infinitely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek() !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the iterator has a current element instead of a next one, potentially causing the loop to terminate prematurely or infinitely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType() !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the iterator's current type is not null instead of checking if there is a next element, potentially causing the loop to terminate prematurely or infinitely.

DONE.
