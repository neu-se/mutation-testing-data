  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `array_slice.reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in the array, which could cause unexpected results in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.length` returns the number of elements in the array, while `array_slice` returns a shallow copy of a portion of the array. This could cause the code to behave differently, especially if the code is expecting an array and instead receives a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.push(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.push(0)` adds an element to the end of the array, while `array_slice` returns a shallow copy of a portion of the array
