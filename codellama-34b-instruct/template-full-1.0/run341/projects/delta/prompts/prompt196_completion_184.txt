  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reference the first operation in the delta's operations array, whereas the original code fragment referenced the last operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[i]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reference a different operation in the delta's operations array based on the value of i, whereas the original code fragment referenced the last operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reference the second-to-last operation in the delta's operations array, whereas the original code fragment referenced the last operation.

DONE.
