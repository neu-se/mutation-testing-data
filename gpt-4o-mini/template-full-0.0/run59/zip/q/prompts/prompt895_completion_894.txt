Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the arguments passed to the function from the original arguments to an empty array, which means the function will not receive any of the intended parameters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the arguments with `null`, which would cause the function to receive a single `null` value instead of the expected arguments, potentially leading to errors or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the context from the original arguments to the current object (`this`), which may not be the intended input for the function, leading to incorrect execution or results.

DONE.
