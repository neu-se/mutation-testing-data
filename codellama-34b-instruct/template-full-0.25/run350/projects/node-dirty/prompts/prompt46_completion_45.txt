  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater(this.get(key)) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the value returned by `updater` to be incremented by 1, which could lead to unexpected results if the `updater` function is not designed to handle this behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater(this.get(key)) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the value returned by `updater` to be decremented by 1, which could lead to unexpected results if the `updater` function is not designed to handle this behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater(this.get(key)) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the value returned by `updater` to be multiplied by 2, which could lead
