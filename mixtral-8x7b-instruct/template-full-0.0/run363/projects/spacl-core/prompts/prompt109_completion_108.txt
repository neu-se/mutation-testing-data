 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
['', ctx]
```
This would result in different behavior because it always checks the policy against an empty path, ignoring the provided `path` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
path.toUpperCase(), ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the `path` argument to uppercase before checking the policy, which may cause mismatches with the original path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.get('another_policy').matches
