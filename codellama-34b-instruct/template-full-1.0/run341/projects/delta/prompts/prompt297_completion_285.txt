  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, { text: 'Some different text' }, i) === false;
```
This would result in different behavior because the attributes object that is passed to the `predicate` function has a different `text` property than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, other.next(1).attributes || {}, i) === false;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `other` variable is undefined, causing the code to throw a `ReferenceError` when attempting to call the `next` method on it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `eachLine` method would exit early, without calling the `predicate` function on the remaining lines.

DONE.
