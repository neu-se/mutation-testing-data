  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFileSync(file, {
  encoding: 'utf8',
  throws: false,
  reviver: (key, value) => {
    if (key === '') {
      return value;
    } else {
      return null;
    }
  },
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` function would be called with the wrong key, causing the JSON parse to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFileSync(file + '.json', options)
```
This would result in different behavior because the file extension would be wrong, causing the read operation to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFileSync(file, {
  encoding: 'utf8',
  throws: false,
  reviver: (key, value) => {
    if (key === '') {
      return JSON.parse(value);
