  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(reject(reason));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fulfill` method is called instead of the `reject` method, which would cause the promise to be resolved instead of rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(Q(reason));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` method is called with the `reason` argument, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the `reason` value instead of being rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(Q.reject(reason));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.reject` method is called with the `reason` argument, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the `reason` value instead of being resolved.

DONE.
