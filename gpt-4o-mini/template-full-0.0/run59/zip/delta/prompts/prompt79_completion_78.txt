Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp.delete === 'string' && newOp.insert == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly checks if `lastOp.delete` is a string instead of a number, and it checks if `newOp.insert` is null instead of checking for its existence, which would prevent valid insert operations from being processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp.delete === 'number' && newOp.insert === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `newOp.insert` is strictly equal to `undefined`, which would exclude valid insertions that are empty strings or other falsy values, leading to unexpected behavior in the insertion logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp.delete === 'number' && newOp.insert === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `newOp.insert` is strictly equal to `0`, which would incorrectly treat a valid insertion of `0` as invalid, potentially causing the insertion logic to skip valid operations.

DONE.
