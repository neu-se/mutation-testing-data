  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the array is different, which would change the value returned by the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the array is different, which would change the value returned by the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[attempt2.length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the array is different, which would change the value returned by the function.

DONE.
