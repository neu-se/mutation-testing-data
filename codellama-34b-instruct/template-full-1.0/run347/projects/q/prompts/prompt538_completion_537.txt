  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.some
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.some` would select a random property from `this`, whereas `this.all` would select all properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[null]
```
This would result in different behavior because `this[null]` would select the property with the key `null`, whereas `this.all` would select all properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.none
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.none` would select no properties, whereas `this.all` would select all properties.

DONE.
