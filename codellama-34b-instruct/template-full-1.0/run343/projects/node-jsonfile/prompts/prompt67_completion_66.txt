  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a string and would cause an error when being passed as an argument to `replace()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because a single space is not the same as an empty string, and the replacement would always produce a space character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because a function reference is not a string and would cause an error when being passed as an argument to `replace()`.

DONE.
