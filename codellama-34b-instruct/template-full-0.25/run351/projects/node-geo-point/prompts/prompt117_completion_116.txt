  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a GeoPoint object, but null is not a GeoPoint object and would cause a type error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new GeoPoint(0, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a GeoPoint object with specific latitude and longitude values, but a new GeoPoint object with latitude and longitude values of 0 would cause the calculateDestination method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.fromLatLngArray([0, 0])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a GeoPoint object with specific latitude and longitude values, but a new GeoPoint object created from an array with latitude and longitude values of 0 would cause the calculateDestination method to return a different result.

DONE.
