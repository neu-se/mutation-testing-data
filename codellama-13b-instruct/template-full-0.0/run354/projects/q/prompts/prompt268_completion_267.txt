  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment rejects the promise with the reason passed as an argument, while the buggy code fragment rejects the promise with a new Error object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw reason
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment rejects the promise with the reason passed as an argument, while the buggy code fragment throws the reason as an exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment rejects the promise with the reason passed as an argument, while the buggy code fragment resolves the promise with the reason.

DONE.
