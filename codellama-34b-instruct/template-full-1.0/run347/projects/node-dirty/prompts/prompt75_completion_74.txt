  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('File does not exist'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an error event with a message indicating that the file does not exist, whereas the original code would emit a 'load' event with the number of entries in the database as the argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a 'load' event with a null argument, whereas the original code would emit a 'load' event with the number of entries in the database as the argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an error event without any argument, whereas the original code would emit an error event with a message indicating that the file does not exist.

DONE.
