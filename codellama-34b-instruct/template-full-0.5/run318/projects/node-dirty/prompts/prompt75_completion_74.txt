  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'load' event would not be emitted, but the 'error' event would be emitted instead, which could cause the program to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'load' event would not be emitted, but the 'close' event would be emitted instead, which could cause the program to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'load' event would not be emitted, but the 'drain' event would be emitted instead, which could cause the program to behave differently.

DONE.
