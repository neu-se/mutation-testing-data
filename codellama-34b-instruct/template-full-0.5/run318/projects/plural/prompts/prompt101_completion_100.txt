  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/b/, 'e'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and would not match the same words as the original.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/a/, 'f'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is different, and would not produce the same result as the original.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/a/, 'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is the same as the original, and would not produce any changes.

DONE.
