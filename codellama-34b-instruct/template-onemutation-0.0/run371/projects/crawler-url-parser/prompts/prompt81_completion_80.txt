  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'src'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `src` attribute is used for the source of an image or other media, whereas the `href` attribute is used for the URL of a link. Using `src` instead of `href` would cause the function to extract URLs from the `src` attribute of `a` elements, which may not be the desired behavior.
