  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER 
can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always result in an
infinite loop since the iterator would never advance beyond the first op.
Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the iterator would always
advance past the very first op, rather than stopping when it encountered the
second op as in the original.
Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always result in an
infinite loop, as the other iterator would never advance beyond the first op.

DONE.
