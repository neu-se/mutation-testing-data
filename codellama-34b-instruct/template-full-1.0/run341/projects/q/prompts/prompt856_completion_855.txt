  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected with `null` instead of the resolved value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected with `undefined` instead of the resolved value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{value: value}
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with an object containing the key `value` instead of the resolved value directly.

DONE.
