  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the other iterator has a next element, while this replacement checks if the length of the next element is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the other iterator has a next element of type 'insert', while this replacement checks if the next element has a type that is not 'insert'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the length of the next element is greater than zero, while this replacement checks if the length of the next element is less than zero.

DONE.
