  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `JSON.parse` to parse the string as is, while this code fragment first converts the string to lowercase before parsing it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `JSON.parse` to parse the entire string, while this code fragment only parses the string starting from the second character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr + 'extra'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `JSON.parse` to parse the string as is, while this code fragment appends the string 'extra' to the end of the string before parsing it.

DONE.
