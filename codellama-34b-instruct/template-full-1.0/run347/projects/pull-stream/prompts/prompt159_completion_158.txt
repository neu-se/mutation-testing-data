  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned the value of `_value`, while the mutated code fragment returns a different value (i.e., `_value + 1`).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-_value
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned the value of `_value`, while the mutated code fragment returns the negative of `_value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned the value of `_value`, while the mutated code fragment returns 0.

DONE.
