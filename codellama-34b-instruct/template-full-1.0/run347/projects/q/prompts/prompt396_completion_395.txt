  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
( <VALUE> => value )()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a function that returns `value`, instead of returning `value` directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the sine of `value`, which may be different from `value` itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the negative of `value`, which may be different from `value` itself.

DONE.
