  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"values"
```
This would result in different behavior because the method expects to receive an array of keys, but the replaced code would cause it to receive an array of values, making it throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"getOwnPropertyNames"
```
This would result in different behavior because the method expects to receive an array of keys, but the replaced code would cause it to receive an array of property names, which is not the same thing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"getOwnPropertySymbols"
```
This would result in different behavior because the method expects to receive an array of keys, but the replaced code would cause it to receive an array of property symbols, which is not the same thing.

DONE.
