  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first element of the `ops` array, which could potentially cause changes to the behavior of the `compose` method, as it relies on the first element being present.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first element of the `ops` array of the `other` delta, which could potentially cause changes to the behavior of the `diff` method, as it relies on the first element being present.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { throw new Error('Oops!') }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the code fragment with a function that throws an exception, which would cause the program to crash.

DONE.
