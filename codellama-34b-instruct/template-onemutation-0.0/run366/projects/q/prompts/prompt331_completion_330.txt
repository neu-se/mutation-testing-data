  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `resolve` variable, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if `resolve` is `true`. This would cause the `resolve` function to never be called, resulting in the promise never being resolved.

DONE.
