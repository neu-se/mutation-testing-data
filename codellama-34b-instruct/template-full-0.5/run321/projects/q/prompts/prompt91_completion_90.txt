  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype.pop` returns the last element of the array, whereas `Array.prototype.slice` returns a shallow copy of a portion of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype.shift` removes and returns the first element of the array, whereas `Array.prototype.slice` returns a shallow copy of a portion of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.reverse
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype.reverse` reverses the order of the elements in the array, whereas `Array.prototype.slice` returns a shallow copy of a portion of the array.

DONE.
