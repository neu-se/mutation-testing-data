Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
indices[r - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the index used for the `quantileSelect` function call, potentially affecting the sorting of the array and the calculated quantile.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
indices[l]
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the left index instead of the right index, which could alter the portion of the array being sorted and affect the overall result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
arr.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the length of the array instead of the index from the `indices` array, which could lead to incorrect sorting or out-of-bounds access.

DONE.
