  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string literal, while the buggy code fragment is a variable reference. This could cause the code to behave differently if the variable is not defined or has a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'Error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string literal, while the buggy code fragment is a constructor function. This could cause the code to behave differently if the constructor function is not defined or has a different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string literal, while the buggy code fragment is a variable reference. This could cause the code to behave differently if the variable is not defined or has a different value.

DONE.
