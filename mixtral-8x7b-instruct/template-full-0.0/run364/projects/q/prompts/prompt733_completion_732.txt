 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise might resolve with a null value, whereas the original code doesn't pass any argument to `deferred.resolve`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.resolve` would refer to the `resolve` method of the current promise prototype, which might not behave the same way as the `deferred.resolve` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve` creates a new resolved promise, which might not have the same behavior as the `deferred.resolve` method.

DONE.
