  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a promise, so the `become` function would not be called, and the promise would not be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a promise, so the `become` function would not be called, and the promise would not be resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` would be called with a new error object, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

DONE.
