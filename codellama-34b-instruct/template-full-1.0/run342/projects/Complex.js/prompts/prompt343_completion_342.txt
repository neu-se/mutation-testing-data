  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(Math.E ** this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using `Math.cos` which is the cosine function, while the replaced code fragment is raising `Math.E` to the power of `this['im']`, which is a different mathematical operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(Math.PI * this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using `Math.cos` which is the cosine function, while the replaced code fragment is multiplying `Math.PI` by `this['im']`, which is a different mathematical operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(Math.E ** this['im']) + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using `Math.cos` which is the cosine function, while the replaced code fragment is adding `Math.E` raised to the power of `this['
