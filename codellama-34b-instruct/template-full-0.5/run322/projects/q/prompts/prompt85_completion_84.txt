  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` expects a function as its argument, and passing `null` would cause it to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick(function() {});
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` expects a function that takes a single argument, and passing an empty function would cause it to not work as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick(function(e) { throw e; });
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` expects a function that takes a single argument and returns a value, and passing a function that throws an error would cause it to not work as intended.

DONE.
