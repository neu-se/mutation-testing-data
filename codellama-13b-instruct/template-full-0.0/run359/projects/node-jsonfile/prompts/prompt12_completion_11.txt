  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.reviver || null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator will return the first truthy value, which in this case is `options.reviver`, if it exists, or `null` if it doesn't. This could cause the `JSON.parse` method to use a different reviver function than the original code, which could potentially lead to different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.reviver && options.reviver
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator will return the second operand if the first operand is truthy, which in this case is `options.reviver`. This could cause the `JSON.parse` method to use the same reviver function as the original code, which could potentially lead to the same behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.reviver ? options.reviver : null
```
This would result
