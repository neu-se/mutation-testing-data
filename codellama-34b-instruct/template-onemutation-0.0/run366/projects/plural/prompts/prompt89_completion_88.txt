  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'person', 'peoples'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the word "people" as the plural form of "person", while the new code fragment uses "peoples" as the plural form. This would cause the pluralization function to return an incorrect result for the word "person".

DONE.
