  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` and `apply` are different methods of the `Function` object, and they have different behaviors when it comes to handling arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function that, when called, will call the original function with a specific `this` value and arguments that are provided to the `bind` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled.apply(null, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` calls the function with a specific `this` value and an array of arguments, whereas `call` calls the function with a specific `this` value and a list of arguments.

DONE.
