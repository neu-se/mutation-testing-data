  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match === undefined
```
This change will cause the `matches` method to return `false` if the `path` argument is `undefined`, which is a different behavior than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match === null || match === undefined
```
This change will cause the `matches` method to return `false` if the `path` argument is `null` or `undefined`, which is a different behavior than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match === null || match === undefined || match.length === 0
```
This change will cause the `matches` method to return `false` if the `path` argument is `null`, `undefined`, or an empty string, which is a different behavior than the original code fragment.

DONE.
