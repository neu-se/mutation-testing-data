  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` returns a rejected promise, whereas `Q` returns a promise that is already fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve(1)` returns a promise that is already fulfilled with the value `1`, whereas `Q` returns a promise that is not yet fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` returns a deferred object, whereas `Q` returns a promise.

DONE.
