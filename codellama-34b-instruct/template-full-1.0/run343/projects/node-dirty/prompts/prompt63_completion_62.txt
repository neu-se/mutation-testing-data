  Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.desp.
```
This would result in different behavior because `desp` is not a method of the `fs.WriteStream` class, so it would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.constructor.
```
This would result in different behavior because `constructor` is a property of the `fs.WriteStream` class that returns a reference to the constructor function that created the object, so it would not have the same behavior as the original code.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.decode.
```
This would result in different behavior because `decode` is not a method of the `fs.WriteStream` class, so it would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
