  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid value for the first argument of `nodeback`, whereas `null` is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a valid value for the first argument of `nodeback`, whereas `null` is not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty string is a valid value for the first argument of `nodeback`, whereas `null` is not.

DONE.
