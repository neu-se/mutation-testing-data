  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index, newOp.length, newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the new op at the end of the current op, rather than at the beginning.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index, 1, newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the new op at index 1, rather than at the beginning.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index, Math.random() * this.ops.length, newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the new op at a random position within the current op, rather than at the beginning.

DONE.
