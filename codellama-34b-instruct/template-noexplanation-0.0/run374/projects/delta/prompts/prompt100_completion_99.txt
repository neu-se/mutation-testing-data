  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp && typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' && lastOp.attributes
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it checks if the `attributes` property of the `lastOp` object is truthy instead of falsy. This could potentially cause the `chop()` method to behave differently than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp && typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' && lastOp.attributes.length > 0
```
This code fragment checks if the `attributes` property of the `lastOp` object is an array with a length greater than 0. This could potentially cause the `chop()` method to behave differently than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp && typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' && lastOp.attributes.length === 0
```
This code fragment checks if the `attributes` property of the `lastOp` object is an array with a length equal
