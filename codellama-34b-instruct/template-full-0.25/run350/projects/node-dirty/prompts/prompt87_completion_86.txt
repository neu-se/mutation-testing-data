  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `arr.shift` removes the first element of the array, whereas `arr.pop` removes the last element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `arr.slice(1)` returns a new array containing all elements except the first, whereas `arr.pop` removes the last element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `arr.reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in the array, whereas `arr.pop` removes the last element.

DONE.
