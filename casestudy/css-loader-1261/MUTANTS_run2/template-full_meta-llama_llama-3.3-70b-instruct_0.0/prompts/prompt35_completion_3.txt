Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
encodeURI(normalizedUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because `encodeURI` is used instead of `unescape`, which would change the way special characters are handled in the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
normalizedUrl.replace(/%/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove all percentage signs from the URL, instead of unescaping them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unescape(url)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would unescape the original `url` instead of the `normalizedUrl`, potentially leading to different results if the `normalizedUrl` has been modified.

DONE.
