  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.push(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because this line would push the callback function to the array even if it's undefined, which is not what the original code does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.push(cbs.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because this line would push the length of the array instead of the callback function itself, which is not what the original code does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.push(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because this line would push the value 1 instead of the callback function, which is not what the original code does.

DONE.
