  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^[ \t]+/gm, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove leading whitespace from the content, which may not be desirable in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.split('\n').map(line => line.trim()).join('\n')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would trim whitespace from each line of the content, which may not be desirable in some cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/[ \t]+/g, ' ')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace all whitespace with a single space character, which may not be desirable in some cases.

DONE.
