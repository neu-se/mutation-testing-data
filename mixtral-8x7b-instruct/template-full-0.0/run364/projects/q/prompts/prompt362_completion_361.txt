 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve()` call would no longer receive a value, potentially causing issues in the code that relies on the resolved value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
42
```
This would result in different behavior because a hardcoded value is being passed to `deferred.resolve()`, which may not be the expected value in the original code, potentially causing issues in the code that relies on the resolved value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject('An error occurred')
```
This would result in different behavior because an error is being rejected instead of resolving the promise, potentially causing issues in the code that relies on the resolved value. DONE.
