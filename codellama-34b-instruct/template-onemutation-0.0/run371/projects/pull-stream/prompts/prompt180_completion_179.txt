  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if `abort` is truthy, while the new code fragment also checks if `onAbort` is truthy. If `onAbort` is falsy, the new code fragment will return `abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)`, which may not be the desired behavior.

DONE.
