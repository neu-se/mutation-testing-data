Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.prototype.forEach.call
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `forEach` instead of `map`, which means it won't return an array of values, but rather `undefined`, potentially breaking the subsequent code that expects an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
cssMapping.sources.filter
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `filter` instead of `map`, which means it will return an array of elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, rather than transforming each element in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
cssMapping.sources.reduce
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `reduce` instead of `map`, which means it will apply a function against an accumulator and each element in the array (from left to right) to reduce it to a single value, rather than transforming each element in the array into a new array.

DONE.
