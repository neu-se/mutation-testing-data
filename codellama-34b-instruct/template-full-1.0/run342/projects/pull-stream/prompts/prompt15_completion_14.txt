  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args = []
```
This would result in different behavior because `args == null` checks whether the `args` variable is null, while `args = []` assigns an empty array to `args`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0] == null
```
This would result in different behavior because `args[0] == null` checks whether the first element of the `args` array is null, while `args == null` checks whether the `args` variable is null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read.length == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `read.length == 0` checks whether the `read` function has no arguments, while `args == null` checks whether the `args` variable is null.

DONE.
