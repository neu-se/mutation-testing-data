  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromCallback` is a different function than `universalify.fromPromise`, and it may not handle errors in the same way.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromPromise(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromPromise(null)` would return a rejected promise, whereas `universalify.fromPromise` would return a resolved promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromPromise(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromPromise(function() {})` would return a resolved promise with a value of `undefined`, whereas `universalify.fromPromise` would return a resolved promise with a value of the original function.

DONE.
