  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to always be rejected, regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to always be fulfilled with a value of `null`, regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Test error")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to always be rejected with an error message of "Test error", regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected.

DONE.
