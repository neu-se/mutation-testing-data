 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument passed to `pull` would be a constant integer instead of the `read` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument passed to `pull` would be `null` instead of the `read` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument passed to `pull` would be the loop variable `i` instead of the `read` function.

DONE.
