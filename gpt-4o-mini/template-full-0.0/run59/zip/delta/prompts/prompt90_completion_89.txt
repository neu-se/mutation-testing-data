Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.retain === 'string' &&
          typeof lastOp.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `retain` properties are strings instead of numbers, which would cause the condition to fail even if both `retain` properties are valid numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.retain === 'number' &&
          typeof lastOp.retain === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it allows the condition to pass if `lastOp.retain` is undefined, which would lead to incorrect merging of operations when `lastOp` does not have a `retain` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain > 0 &&
          lastOp.retain > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check if both `retain` values are greater than zero, which would prevent merging operations with zero or negative retain values, potentially leading to unexpected results.

DONE.
