  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver(deferred.resolve, deferred.reject, deferred.notify);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolver` function is not defined in the provided code snippet, and the code would throw a `ReferenceError` when attempting to call it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(resolver);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolver` function is not called, and the `deferred.resolve` method is called with the `resolver` function itself as an argument, rather than with the result of calling the `resolver` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(resolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolver` function is called and its result is passed to the `deferred.resolve` method, rather than the `resolver` function itself.

DONE.
