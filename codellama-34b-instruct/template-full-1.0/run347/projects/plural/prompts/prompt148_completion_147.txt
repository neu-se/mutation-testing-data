  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word + "s"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add an "s" to the end of the word, regardless of the word's plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last character of the word, regardless of whether it is a consonant or a vowel.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word[word.length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the last character of the word, regardless of whether it is a consonant or a vowel.

Done.
