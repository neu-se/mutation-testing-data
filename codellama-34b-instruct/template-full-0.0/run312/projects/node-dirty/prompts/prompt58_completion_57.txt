  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is called immediately, rather than being called after the `close` method is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', this._data.size);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is called with a different argument, which could cause the event handler to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', this._data.size - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is called with a different argument, which could cause the event handler to behave differently.

DONE.
