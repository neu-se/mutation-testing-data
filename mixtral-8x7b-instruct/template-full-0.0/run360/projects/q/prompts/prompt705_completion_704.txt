 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fbind` method would return a function that ignores the original `arguments` and instead uses an empty array, causing unexpected behavior when the bound function is called with arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fbind` method would return a function that ignores the original `arguments` and instead uses `null`, causing unexpected behavior when the bound function is called with arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fbind` method would return a function that uses the `arguments` of the bound function's context (`this`), rather than the original `arguments` of the `fbind` function, causing unexpected behavior when the bound function is called with arguments.

DONE.
