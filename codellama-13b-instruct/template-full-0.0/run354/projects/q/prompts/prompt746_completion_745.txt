  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onFulfilled` function would be called when the promise is fulfilled, whereas the original code fragment would not call any function in that case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onRejected` function would be called when the promise is rejected, whereas the original code fragment would not call any function in that case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onProgress
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onProgress` function would be called when the promise is in a pending state, whereas the original code fragment would not call any function in that case.

DONE.
