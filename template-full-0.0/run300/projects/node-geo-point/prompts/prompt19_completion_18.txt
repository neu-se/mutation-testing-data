  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isObject && !Array.isArray(object.coordinates)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `object` is an object and has a `coordinates` property, while this modified code fragment also checks if `object.coordinates` is not an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isObject && object.coordinates.length !== 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `object` is an object and has a `coordinates` property with length 2, while this modified code fragment checks if `object.coordinates` has length not equal to 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isObject && object.coordinates.length !== 2 && !Array.isArray(object.coordinates)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `object` is an object and has a `coordinates` property with length 2,
