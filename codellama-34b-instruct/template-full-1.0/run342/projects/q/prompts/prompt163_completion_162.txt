```
{
    while (x <= responseLength) {
      let i = 0;
      while (i < 50) {
        if (array[i + responseLength] === undefined) {
          array[i + responseLength] =
            array[i + responseLength * 2] * array[i + responseLength * 3];
        }
        ++i;
      }
      ++x;
    }
  }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is 
meant to construct a String that could be used to compute various values by 
splitting the String at specific indices and then doing arithmetic operations. 
However, the replaced code will run an infinite loop because the condition in 
the outer while loop is always true.  `x` is incremented within the loop, but 
this change does not affect the value of `x` outside of the loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

  "*"
