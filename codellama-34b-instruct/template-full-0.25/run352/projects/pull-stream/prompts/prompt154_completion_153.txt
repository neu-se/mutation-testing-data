  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `onAbort` is a function reference, while `onAbort()` is a function call. The function call would execute the function immediately, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `onAbort` is a function reference, while `onAbort.call(this)` is a function call with a specific context. The function call with a specific context may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `onAbort` is a function reference, while `onAbort.bind(this)` is a function reference with a specific context. The function reference with a specific context may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
