Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `null` instead of `data` would cause the consumer of the stream to receive a `null` value, which may lead to unexpected behavior or errors when processing the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `undefined` instead of `data` would indicate that no value is available, potentially causing the consumer to handle the absence of data differently than if the original data were returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because modifying `data` by adding `1` would change the value being passed to the callback, which could lead to incorrect processing or calculations in the consumer of the stream.

DONE.
