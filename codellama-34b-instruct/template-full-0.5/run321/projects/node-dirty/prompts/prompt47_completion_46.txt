  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would call the `cb` function, while the new code fragment would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would call the `cb` function with no arguments, while the new code fragment would call the `cb` function with the `this` context set to the `Dirty` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would call the `cb` function with no arguments, while the new code fragment would call the `cb` function with the `this` context set to the `Dirty` object and the `cb` function would be called with the `this` context set to the `Dirty` object.

DONE.
