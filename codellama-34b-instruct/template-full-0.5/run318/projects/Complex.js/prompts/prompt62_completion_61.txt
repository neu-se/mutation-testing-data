  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg']
```
This would result in different behavior because `arg` and `phi` are different properties of the `a` object, and `arg` is not defined in the `a` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['phi'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `phi` is a property of the `a` object, but `phi + 1` is not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['phi'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `phi` is a property of the `a` object, but `phi * 2` is not.

DONE.
