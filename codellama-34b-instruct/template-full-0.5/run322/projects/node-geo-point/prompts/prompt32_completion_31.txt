  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos(r)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.acos` expects a value between -1 and 1, while `r` can take any value in the range of -1 to 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(sin(θ), cos(θ))
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan2` expects two arguments, while `sin(θ)` and `cos(θ)` are single values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.asin(sin(θ))
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.asin` expects a value between -1 and 1, while `sin(θ)` can take any value in the range of -1 to 1.

DONE.
