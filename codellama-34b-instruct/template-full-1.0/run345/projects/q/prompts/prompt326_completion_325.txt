  This code seems to be a implementation of a Promise, a construct that allows to handle asynchronous operations. The code defines a set of methods and properties that are required for a Promise.

To answer your question, we can look at the `promiseDispatch` method, which is supposed to be called with a function that resolves or rejects the promise, and the `when` method, which is supposed to return a promise that is fulfilled with the outcome of the `promiseDispatch` method.

Here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would unconditionally resolve the promise with the value `value`, without waiting for the `promiseDispatch` method to finish. This could cause the promise to resolve before the asynchronous operation is complete, which could lead to incorrect behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.reject(new Error('Rejected'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would un
