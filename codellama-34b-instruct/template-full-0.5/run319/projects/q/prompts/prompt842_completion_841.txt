  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).delay
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.delay` returns a promise for the resolution of the given promise after a certain time period, whereas `Q.timeout` returns a promise that is rejected if the given promise is not fulfilled before the timeout.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.then` returns a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the callback function, whereas `Q.timeout` returns a promise that is rejected if the given promise is not fulfilled before the timeout.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.catch` returns a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the callback function if the given promise is rejected, whereas `Q.timeout` returns a promise that is rejected if the given promise is not fulfilled before the timeout.

DONE.
