  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return index + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the transformed index, while this replacement returns the original index plus one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return index - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the transformed index, while this replacement returns the original index minus one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return index * 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the transformed index, while this replacement returns the original index multiplied by two.

DONE.
