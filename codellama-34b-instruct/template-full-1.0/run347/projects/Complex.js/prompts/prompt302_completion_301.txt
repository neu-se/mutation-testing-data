  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by -1 would change the overall sign of the final expression, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b+1
```
This would result in different behavior because adding 1 to b would shift the entire range of possible values for the expression, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b*b
```
This would result in different behavior because squaring b would change the order of the expression, potentially leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
