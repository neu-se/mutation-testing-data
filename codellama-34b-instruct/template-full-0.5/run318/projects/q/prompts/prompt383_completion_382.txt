  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("callback was not a function"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would have called the `callback` function if it was a function, but this new code fragment would have rejected the promise with an error if `callback` was not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(callback)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would have called the `callback` function if it was a function, but this new code fragment would have resolved the promise with the `callback` function itself, regardless of whether it was a function or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(callback()).then(function(value) { return value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would have called the `callback` function if it was a function and returned its result, but this new code fragment would have resolved the promise with the result of calling the
