  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift()` returns the first element of the array and removes it from the array, while `ref` returns the array itself. This change would result in the test suite not identifying the issue with the `shift()` method, as it would not be called with the expected arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` returns the last element of the array and removes it from the array, while `ref` returns the array itself. This change would result in the test suite not identifying the issue with the `pop()` method, as it would not be called with the expected arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a new array with the specified range of elements, while `ref` returns the array itself. This change would result in the test suite not ident
