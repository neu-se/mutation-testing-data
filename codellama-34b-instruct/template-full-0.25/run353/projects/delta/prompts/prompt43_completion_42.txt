  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the length of the string was 0, but the new code fragment would check if the length was 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the length of the string was 0, but the new code fragment would check if the length was -1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"a"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the length of the string was 0, but the new code fragment would check if the length was 1, since the string "a" has a length of 1.

DONE.
