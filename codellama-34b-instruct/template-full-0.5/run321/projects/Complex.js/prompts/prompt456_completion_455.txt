  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Math.abs(z['re'] - this['re']) <= Complex['EPSILON'] &&
        Math.abs(z['im'] - this['im']) <= Complex['EPSILON'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `===` operator to compare the values, while this new code fragment uses the `<==` operator, which allows for a greater margin of error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Math.abs(z['re'] - this['re']) > Complex['EPSILON'] ||
        Math.abs(z['im'] - this['im']) > Complex['EPSILON'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `===` operator to compare the values, while this new code fragment uses the `!==` operator, which allows for a greater margin of error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Math.abs(z
