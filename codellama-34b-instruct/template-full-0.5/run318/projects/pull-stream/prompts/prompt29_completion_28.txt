  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the first argument instead of the second argument to the `pull` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the third argument instead of the second argument to the `pull` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[length-1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the last argument instead of the second argument to the `pull` function.

DONE.
