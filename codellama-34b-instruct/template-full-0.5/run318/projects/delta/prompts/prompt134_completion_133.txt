  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextOp.attributes` is not a valid property of the `Op` object, and would cause the code to throw a `TypeError` when trying to access it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.ops.length` is not a valid property of the `Op` object, and would cause the code to throw a `TypeError` when trying to access it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(index, index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.ops.slice(index, index + 1)` would return a new array with a single element, whereas `nextOp` is a single element.

DONE.
