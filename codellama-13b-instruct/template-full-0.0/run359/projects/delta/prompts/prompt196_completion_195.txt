  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the last element of the `ops` array, which is not the same as the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the first element of the `ops` array, which is not the same as the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[Math.floor(delta.ops.length / 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access a random element of the `ops` array, which is not the same as the original code fragment.

DONE.
