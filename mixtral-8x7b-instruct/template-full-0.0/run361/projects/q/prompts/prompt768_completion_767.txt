 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Promise(resolve => resolve(null))
```
This would result in different behavior because the new promise will always be fulfilled with a value of `null`, whereas the original code fragment uses `noop` which does not provide any value. This change could expose potential issues in the test suite when handling fulfilled promises with values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
promise.then(resolve, reject)
