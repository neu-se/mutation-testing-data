  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the `rules` array, which could cause the `matches()` method to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method returns a new array that contains all elements from the `rules` array except for the first element, which could cause the `matches()` method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.filter((rule) => rule.matches(path, ctx))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter()` method returns a new array that contains all elements from the `rules` array that pass the test implemented by the provided function, which could cause the `matches()` method to return a different result.

DONE.
