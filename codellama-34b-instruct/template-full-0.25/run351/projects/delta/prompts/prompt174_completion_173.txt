  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the length of the operation to be doubled, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() - otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the length of the operation to be reduced, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the length of the operation to be reduced, potentially leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
