  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(exports + 0).hello(arg, priority);
``` 
This would result in different behavior because `hello` is not a method on the `exports` object, so it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(Math.random() < 0.5 ? module.exports : exports).hello(arg, priority);
``` 
This would result in different behavior because it would randomly choose between `module.exports` and `exports`, causing the code to either work or throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
globalThis.hello(arg, priority);
``` 
This would result in different behavior because `hello` is a global function, but it is not defined in the code snippet provided, so it would throw a ReferenceError.

DONE.
