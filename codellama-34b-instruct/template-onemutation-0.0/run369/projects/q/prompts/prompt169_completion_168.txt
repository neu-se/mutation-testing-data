  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNodeFrame
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNodeFrame` is a function that checks if a stack line is from Node.js, and `isInternalFrame` is a function that checks if a stack line is from the Q library. Using `isNodeFrame` instead of `isInternalFrame` would cause the `filterStackString` function to filter out stack lines that are from Node.js, which would result in a different stack trace.
