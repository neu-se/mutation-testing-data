  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the value of `i` instead of incrementing it, which would cause the loop to terminate earlier than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the value of `i` by 2 instead of 1, which would cause the loop to iterate over more elements than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reset the value of `i` to 0 instead of incrementing it, which would cause the loop to iterate indefinitely.

DONE.
