 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
op.retain !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider an undefined `retain` property as true, which could lead to incorrect length calculation when `retain` is expected to be a number or an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
typeof op.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat the `retain` property as a string, even if it is a number or an object, leading to incorrect length calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
op.hasOwnProperty('retain')
