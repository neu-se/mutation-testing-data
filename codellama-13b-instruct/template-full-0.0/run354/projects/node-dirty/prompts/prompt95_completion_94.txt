  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the string to uppercase, which would cause the `JSON.parse()` method to fail if the string contains any lowercase letters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the string to lowercase, which would cause the `JSON.parse()` method to fail if the string contains any uppercase letters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trim()` method would remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the string, which would cause the `JSON.parse()` method to fail if the string contains any whitespace characters.

DONE.
