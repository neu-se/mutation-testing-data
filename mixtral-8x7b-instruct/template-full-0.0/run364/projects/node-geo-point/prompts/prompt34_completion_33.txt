 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / Math.cos(point2Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce a division by zero error when `point2Rad` is 90 or -90, which is possible in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(-point1Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the sign of the result when `point1Rad` is negative, which is possible in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin(point1Rad + point2Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not correctly handle the case where `point1Rad` and `point2Rad` have opposite signs, which is possible in the original code.

DONE.
