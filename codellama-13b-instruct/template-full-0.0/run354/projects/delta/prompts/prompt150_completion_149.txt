  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `otherIter.next` is a reference to the `next` method of the `otherIter` object, while the modified code fragment `otherIter.next()` is a call to the `next` method with no arguments. This could result in different behavior if the `next` method has side effects or if it is overridden in a subclass.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `otherIter.next` is a reference to the `next` method of the `otherIter` object, while the modified code fragment `otherIter.next(1)` is a call to the `next` method with an argument of `1`. This could result in different behavior if the `next` method has side effects or if it is overridden in a subclass.
