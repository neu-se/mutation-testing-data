 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the current execution context, which is not guaranteed to be the same as the original `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the behavior of the `apply` method, which expects the first argument to be an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments` is a special keyword in JavaScript that refers to the arguments passed to the current function, and it is not the same as the `ref` variable.

DONE.
