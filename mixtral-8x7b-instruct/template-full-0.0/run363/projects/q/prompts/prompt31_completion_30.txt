 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => laterQueue.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the first element from the `laterQueue` array instead of the last one, potentially changing the order of task execution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {
    laterQueue.pop();
    throw new Error('Artificial error for mutation testing');
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it throws an error upon popping an element from the `laterQueue` array, which was not part of the original code's behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {
    laterQueue.pop(1);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to pass an argument to the `Array.prototype.pop()` method, which does not accept any arguments and always returns the last element of the array.

DONE.
