  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [val, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the key and value would be swapped in the forEach loop, causing the loop to iterate over the values instead of the keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, val] = [val, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the key and value would be swapped in the forEach loop, causing the loop to iterate over the values instead of the keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, val] = [key, val]
```
This would result in different behavior because the key and value would be swapped in the forEach loop, causing the loop to iterate over the values instead of the keys.

DONE.
