Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('Drain event not emitted'));
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of emitting the 'drain' event when the write stream is ready, it emits an error event, which could lead to the application not handling the drain condition properly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', this._data.size + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly emits the 'load' event with an incremented size of the data, which could mislead listeners into thinking there is one more item than actually exists in the data store.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', 'extra data');
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits the 'drain' event with an additional string argument, which could cause any listeners expecting a different signature to malfunction or throw errors.

DONE.
