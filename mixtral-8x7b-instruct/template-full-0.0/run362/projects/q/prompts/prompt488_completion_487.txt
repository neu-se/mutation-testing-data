 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
resetUnhandledRejections();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resetUnhandledRejections` function is called without passing any argument, which would reset the internal state of unhandled rejections tracking. However, the original code uses `resetUnhandledRejections` as a statement, which does not call the function. This change would cause the tracked unhandled rejections to be lost, and the `getUnhandledReasons` function would always return an empty array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
trackUnhandledRejections = false;
```
This would result in different behavior because it disables the tracking of unhandled rejections by setting the `trackUnhandledRejections` variable to `false`. In contrast, the original code uses `resetUnhandledRejections` as a statement, which resets the internal state of unhandled rejections tracking without disabling it. This change would cause the `getUnhandledReasons` function to always
