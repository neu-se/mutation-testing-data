 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
nextType === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would now check for an 'insert' operation instead of a 'delete' operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
nextType !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would now check for any operation other than 'insert', instead of specifically checking for 'delete'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peekType() !== 'insert' && nextType === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would now check for both the current operation being 'delete' and the next operation not being 'insert', instead of just checking for the current operation being 'delete'.

DONE.
