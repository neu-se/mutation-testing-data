  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` adds an element to the end of an array, while `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of an array. This could cause the program to behave differently if the order of the elements in the `nodeArgs` array is important.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` adds an element to the end of an array, while `pop` removes the last element from an array. This could cause the program to behave differently if the last element of the `nodeArgs` array is important.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` adds an element to the end of an array, while `shift` removes the first element from an array. This could cause the program to behave differently if the first element of the `nodeArgs` array is important.
