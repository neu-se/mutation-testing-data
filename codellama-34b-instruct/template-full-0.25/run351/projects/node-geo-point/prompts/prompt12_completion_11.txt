  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type !== 'Point' || point.coordinates.length !== 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also check if the `coordinates` property of the `point` object has a length of 2, which is not checked in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type !== 'Point' && point.coordinates.length !== 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `type` property of the `point` object is not equal to `'Point'` and the `coordinates` property has a length of 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type !== 'Point' && point.coordinates.length === 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `type` property of the `point` object is not equal to `'Point'` and the `coordinates` property has a length of 2.

DONE.
