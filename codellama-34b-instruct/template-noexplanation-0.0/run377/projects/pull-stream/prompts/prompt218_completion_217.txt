  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err, null
```
This change will cause the `map` function to always return `null`, regardless of the input data. This will result in the `asyncMap` function always returning `null` as well, which may cause issues for the code that uses it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err, undefined
```
This change will cause the `map` function to always return `undefined`, regardless of the input data. This will result in the `asyncMap` function always returning `undefined` as well, which may cause issues for the code that uses it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err, 'error'
```
This change will cause the `map` function to always return the string `'error'`, regardless of the input data. This will result in the `asyncMap` function always returning the string `'error'` as well, which may cause issues for the code that uses it.

DONE.
