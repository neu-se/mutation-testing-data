  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push(`/${part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$1')}`)
```

This would result in different behavior because the backslash in the replacement string is not escaped, causing the regular expression to be invalid.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push(`/${part.replace(/\(\[$/, '\\$')}`)
```

This would result in different behavior because the regular expression group is not properly closed, causing the regular expression to be invalid.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push(`/${part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$2')}`)
```

This would result in different behavior because the regular expression group has an incorrect reference, causing the regular expression to be invalid.

DONE.
