  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the callback to be called with a null error and the data, regardless of whether the test passed or failed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the callback to be called with the error and null data, regardless of whether the test passed or failed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the callback to be called with null error and data, regardless of whether the test passed or failed.

DONE.
