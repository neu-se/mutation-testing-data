  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the entire `coordinates` array, while this code fragment only returns the first element of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the entire `coordinates` array, while this code fragment only returns the second element of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the entire `coordinates` array, while this code fragment only returns the third element of the array.

DONE.
