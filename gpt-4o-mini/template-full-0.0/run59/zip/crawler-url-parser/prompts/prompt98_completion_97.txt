Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!urlMap.has(currentUrl.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the original condition, causing the code block to execute when the URL is not present in the map, which is the opposite of the intended logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.size === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the map is empty instead of checking for the presence of the specific URL, leading to the code block executing whenever there are no entries in the map, regardless of the current URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.get(currentUrl.url) === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the value associated with the current URL is `undefined`, which could lead to a false positive if the URL exists but has a valid entry, thus altering the flow of the logic.

DONE.
