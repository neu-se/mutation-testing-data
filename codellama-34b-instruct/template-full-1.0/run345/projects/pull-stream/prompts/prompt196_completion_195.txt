  Here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER, each with a brief explanation of why the change in behavior is significant:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `read` function to be called with a different argument (namely, `undefined`) when the `abort` signal is not provided. This could potentially cause the `read` function to return a different value or error, which could in turn affect the behavior of the `asyncMap` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `read` function to be called when the `abort` signal is not provided, rather than when it is provided as before. This could potentially cause the `read` function to return a different value or error, which could in turn affect the behavior of the `asyncMap` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result
