  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate to `true` for any value of `b`, not just `0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate to `true` for any value of `b` that is not `0`, not just `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate to `true` only when `b` is equal to `1`, not for any other value of `b`.

DONE.
