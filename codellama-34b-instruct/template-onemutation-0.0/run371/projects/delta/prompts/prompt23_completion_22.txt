  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` function to always return `undefined`, regardless of the input. The original code fragment `a[key]` accesses the value of the `key` property of the `a` object, while `b[key]` accesses the value of the `key` property of the `b` object. If the `b` object does not have a `key` property, the `diff` function would return `undefined`, which is not the desired behavior.

DONE.
