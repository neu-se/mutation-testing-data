  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` and `Math.cos` have different outputs for the same input, which would cause the `Complex` constructor to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan` and `Math.cos` have different outputs for the same input, which would cause the `Complex` constructor to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` and `Math.cos` have different outputs for the same input, which would cause the `Complex` constructor to return a different value.

DONE.
