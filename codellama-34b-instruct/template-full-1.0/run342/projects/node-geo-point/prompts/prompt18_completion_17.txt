  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the input is not an object, while the new code fragment checks if the input is strictly equal to null. This means that the new code fragment would not catch undefined or other non-object types, leading to potential errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.constructor !== Object
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the input is not an object, while the new code fragment checks if the input's constructor is not the Object constructor. This means that the new code fragment would not catch objects that are not constructed using the Object constructor, such as those created using the Symbol or Function constructors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.prototype !== Object.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the input is not an object, while the new code fragment checks if the input's prototype is not the Object prototype. This
