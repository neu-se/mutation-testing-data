  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback(error, value)
```
This code fragment is different from the original code fragment `nodeback` because it passes two arguments to the `nodeback` function, whereas the original code fragment only passes one argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback(value, error)
```
This code fragment is different from the original code fragment `nodeback` because it passes the arguments to the `nodeback` function in a different order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback(null, value)
```
This code fragment is different from the original code fragment `nodeback` because it passes a `null` value as the first argument to the `nodeback` function, whereas the original code fragment does not pass any arguments.

DONE.
