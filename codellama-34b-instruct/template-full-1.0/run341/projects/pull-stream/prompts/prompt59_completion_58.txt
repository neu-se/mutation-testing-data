  Sure, here are three possible buggy code fragments that can be used to replace the `PLACEHOLDER` in the provided code:

Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the value of `abort`, causing the while loop to execute even if `abort` is truthy.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
++abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `++` operator would increment the value of `abort`, potentially causing the while loop to execute more times than intended.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
abort()
```
This would result in different behavior because `abort` would be called as a function, potentially causing an error if it is not actually a function.

DONE.
