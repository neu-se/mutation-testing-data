Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
encodeURI(normalizedUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `encodeURI` function is used instead of leaving the `normalizedUrl` as is, which could lead to incorrect decoding of URLs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
normalizedUrl + "?mutated"
```
This would result in different behavior because a query parameter `?mutated` is appended to the `normalizedUrl`, which could affect how the URL is processed or interpreted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
rootContext + normalizedUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rootContext` is prepended to the `normalizedUrl`, which could change the base path or context of the URL, potentially leading to incorrect resolution or processing.

DONE.
