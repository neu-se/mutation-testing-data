  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This change will cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved, which will result in a different behavior than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This change will cause the promise to be notified instead of resolved, which will result in a different behavior than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value)
```
This change will cause the promise to be resolved with a different value than the original code, which will result in a different behavior.

DONE.
