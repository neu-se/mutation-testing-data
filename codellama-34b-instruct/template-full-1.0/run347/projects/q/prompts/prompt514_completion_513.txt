  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0;
```
This would result in infinite recursion because  `defer` references a variable that is not defined, causing the function to repeatedly call itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined;
```
This would result in a different error because `undefined` is not a promise and does not have a `catch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.promise;
```
This would result in the same behavior as the original code because it references the promise returned by `deferred`, which is the same promise that is returned by the function.

DONE.
