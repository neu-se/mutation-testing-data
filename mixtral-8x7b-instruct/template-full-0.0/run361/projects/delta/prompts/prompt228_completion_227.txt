 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because `Infinity` is not a number, and it would cause the `Math.min()` function to always return `-Infinity` when comparing with `length`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peekLength() * 2
