 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the sum of the lengths of the next operations in both iterators instead of the minimum. This could lead to skipping or processing too many operations in the `diff` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the maximum of the lengths of the next operations in both iterators instead of the minimum. This could lead to skipping or processing too many operations in the `diff` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() * otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the product of the lengths of the next operations in both iterators instead of the minimum. This would likely lead to skipping or processing
