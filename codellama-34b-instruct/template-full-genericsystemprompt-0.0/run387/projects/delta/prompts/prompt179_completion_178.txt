  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by a fixed amount, rather than by the length of the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the other iterator by a fixed amount, rather than by the length of the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by the length of the current operation in the other iterator, rather than by a fixed amount.

DONE.
