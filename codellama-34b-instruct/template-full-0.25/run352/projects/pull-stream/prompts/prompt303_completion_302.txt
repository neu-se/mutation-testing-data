  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `ended` variable to check if the stream has ended, while the new code fragment uses the negation of `ended` to check if the stream has not ended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && !end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `ended` variable to check if the stream has ended, while the new code fragment uses the `end` variable to check if the stream has ended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || !end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `ended` variable to check if the stream has ended, while the new code fragment uses the `end` variable to check if the stream has ended.

DONE.
