  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality, while this replacement checks for inequality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] === b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for inequality, while this replacement checks for equality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] + b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality, while this replacement performs an addition operation.

DONE.
