  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op === "done" && operands[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check the third operand when the operation is "done", whereas the original code fragment checks the second operand regardless of the operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op === "when" && !operands[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check the second operand when the operation is "when", whereas the original code fragment checks the second operand regardless of the operation. Additionally, the original code fragment checks if the second operand is truthy, whereas this code fragment checks if it is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op === "done" || operands[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the operation is "done" or if the second operand is truthy, whereas the original code fragment only checks if the second operand is truthy regardless of the operation
