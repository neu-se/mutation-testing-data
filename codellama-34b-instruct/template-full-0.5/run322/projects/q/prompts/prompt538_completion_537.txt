  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.race
```
This would result in different behavior because `race` is a different method than `all`, and it returns a promise that resolves when any of the promises in the array fulfills, rather than waiting for all of them to fulfill.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.any
```
This would result in different behavior because `any` is a different method than `all`, and it returns a promise that resolves when any of the promises in the array fulfills, rather than waiting for all of them to fulfill.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.none
```
This would result in different behavior because `none` is a different method than `all`, and it returns a promise that resolves when none of the promises in the array fulfills, rather than waiting for all of them to fulfill.

DONE.
