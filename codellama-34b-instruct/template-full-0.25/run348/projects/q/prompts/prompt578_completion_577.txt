  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer, "throw"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "throw" keyword would cause the generator to throw an exception, which would be caught by the `errback` function and result in a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer, "next"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "next" keyword would cause the generator to move to the next iteration, which would result in the `callback` function being called with the next value in the iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer, "return"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "return" keyword would cause the generator to return a value, which would be caught by the `callback` function and result in a fulfilled promise with the returned value.

DONE.
