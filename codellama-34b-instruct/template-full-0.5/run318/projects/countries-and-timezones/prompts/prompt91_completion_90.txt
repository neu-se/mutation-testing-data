  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone
```
This would result in different behavior because `getTimezone` is a different function than `getCountry`, and it may not return the same result for the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountryForTimezone
```
This would result in different behavior because `getCountryForTimezone` is a different function than `getCountry`, and it may not return the same result for the same input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountriesForTimezone
```
This would result in different behavior because `getCountriesForTimezone` is a different function than `getCountry`, and it may not return the same result for the same input.

DONE.
