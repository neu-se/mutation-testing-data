 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fbind` method would return a function that ignores its `this` binding and any arguments, and instead always passes an empty array to the `apply` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ length: 0 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fbind` method would return a function that ignores its `this` binding and any arguments, and instead always passes an empty object with a `length` property of 0 to the `apply` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fbind` method would return a function that always calls the `apply` method with an empty function as its first argument, instead of the expected `this` binding.

DONE.
