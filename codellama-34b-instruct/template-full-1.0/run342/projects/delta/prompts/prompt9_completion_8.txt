  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const key in a) {
```
This would result in different behavior because `const` is a block-scoped variable that can't be reassigned, unlike `let` or `var`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (key in a) {
```
This would result in different behavior because `key` is not declared, and the reference to it would be an implicit global.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (i in a) {
```
This would result in different behavior because `i` is not declared, and the reference to it would be an implicit global.

DONE.
