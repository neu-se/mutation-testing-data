  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Math.sin` to calculate the sine of the real part of the complex number, while the modified code uses `-Math.sin` to calculate the negative sine of the real part of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Math.sin` to calculate the sine of the real part of the complex number, while the modified code uses `Math.cos` to calculate the cosine of the real part of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Math.sin` to calculate the sine of the real part of the complex number, while the modified code uses `Math.tan` to calculate the tangent of the real part of the complex number.

DONE.
