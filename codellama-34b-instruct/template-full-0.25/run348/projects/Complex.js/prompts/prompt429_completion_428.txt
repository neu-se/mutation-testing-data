  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10, places || 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would cause the expression to always evaluate to `1`, regardless of the value of `places`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10, places && 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would cause the expression to always evaluate to `0`, regardless of the value of `places`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10, places ^ 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `^` operator would cause the expression to always evaluate to `10`, regardless of the value of `places`.

DONE.
