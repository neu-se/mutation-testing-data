  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a callback function that is called with the result of the `read` function, while `null` is a null value that is not a function and will not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a callback function that is called with the result of the `read` function, while `undefined` is a value that is not a function and will not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a callback function that is called with the result of the `read` function, while `function() {}` is a new function that is not the same as the original `cb` function and will not be called with the same arguments.

DONE.
