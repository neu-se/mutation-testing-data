  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `messages` array is used to store the arguments for the `promiseDispatch` method, and the `length` property is used to determine the number of elements in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `messages` array is used to store the arguments for the `promiseDispatch` method, and the first element of the array is used to determine the value of the `messages` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `messages` array is used to store the arguments for the `promiseDispatch` method, and the `slice` method is used to extract the first element of the array.

DONE.
