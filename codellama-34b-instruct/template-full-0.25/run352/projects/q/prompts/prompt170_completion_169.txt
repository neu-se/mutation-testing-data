  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.split(" ").join("")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a string with all spaces removed, rather than a string with the first word removed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a string with the first character removed, rather than a string with the first word removed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.replace(/^\w+/, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a string with the first word removed, rather than a string with the first character removed.

DONE.
