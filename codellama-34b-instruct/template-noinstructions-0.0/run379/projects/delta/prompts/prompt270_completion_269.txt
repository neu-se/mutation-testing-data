  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(Op.length(thisIter.next()));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the length of the next operation in the iterator, rather than the length of the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(Op.length(otherIter.next()));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the length of the next operation in the other iterator, rather than the length of the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(Op.length(thisIter.next()) + Op.length(otherIter.next()));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the sum of the lengths of the next operations in both iterators, rather than the length of the current operation.

DONE.
