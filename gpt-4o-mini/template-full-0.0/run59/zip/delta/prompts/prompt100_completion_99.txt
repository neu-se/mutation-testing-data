Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp || typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' && !lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the logical OR operator (`||`) instead of the logical AND operator (`&&`), which would cause the condition to evaluate to `true` if `lastOp` is truthy, regardless of the other conditions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp && typeof lastOp.retain === 'string' && !lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `lastOp.retain` is a string instead of a number, which would cause the condition to fail if `lastOp.retain` is indeed a number, leading to different execution flow.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp && typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' && lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `lastOp.attributes` is truthy instead of falsy, which would change the condition to only pass if `lastOp` has attributes, potentially skipping the `pop`
