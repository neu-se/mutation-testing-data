  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate one more time, potentially reading from an invalid index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate in the opposite direction, potentially reading from different indices.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate indefinitely, potentially leading to an infinite loop.

DONE.
