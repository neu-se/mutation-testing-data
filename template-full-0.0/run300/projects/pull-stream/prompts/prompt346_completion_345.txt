  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.test
```
This would result in different behavior because `test` is a different method than `exec` and would return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.match
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is a different method than `exec` and would return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` is a different method than `exec` and would return a different result.

DONE.
