  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (x instanceof y) {
    return x.join(y);
} else {
    return y.join(x);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `instanceof` operator to check if `x` is an instance of `y`, and if so, it returns `x.join(y)`, otherwise it returns `y.join(x)`. This would cause the `Join` function to behave differently in cases where `x` and `y` are instances of different classes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (x < y) {
    return x;
} else {
    return y;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `<` operator to compare `x` and `y`, and if `x` is less than `y`, it returns `x`, otherwise it returns `y`. This would cause the `Join` function to behave differently in cases where `x` and `y` are numerical values.
