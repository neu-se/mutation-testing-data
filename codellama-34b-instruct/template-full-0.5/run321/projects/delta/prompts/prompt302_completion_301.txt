  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, iter.next(2).attributes || {}, i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip over the first character of the line and start at the second character instead, potentially changing the attributes applied to the line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, iter.next(1).attributes || {}, i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would start applying the attributes to the next line instead of the current line, potentially causing the attributes to be applied incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, iter.next(1).attributes || {}, i - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would apply the attributes to the previous line instead of the current line, potentially causing the attributes to be applied incorrectly.

DONE.
