  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `parts.pop` would remove the last element of the `parts` array, instead of adding a new element to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `parts.shift` would remove the first element of the `parts` array, instead of adding a new element to it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `parts.unshift` would add a new element to the beginning of the `parts` array, instead of adding a new element to it.

DONE.
