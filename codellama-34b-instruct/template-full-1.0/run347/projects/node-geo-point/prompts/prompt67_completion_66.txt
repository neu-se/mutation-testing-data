  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y * x
```
This would result in different behavior because `y` and `x` are both numbers, but the original code only uses `y`. Using `y * x` would introduce a multiplication operation that is not present in the original code, which could potentially change the result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * y
```
This would result in different behavior because `2` is a different constant than `y`. Using `2 * y` would change the result of the expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y.something
```
This would result in different behavior because `something` is not a valid property of `y`. The original code assumes that `y` is a number, but if it is an object with a `something` property, the behavior of the code would be different.

DONE.
