  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.chop();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `chop` method is not defined on the `delta` object, and would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.slice();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method is not defined on the `delta` object, and would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.splice();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method is not defined on the `delta` object, and would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

DONE.
