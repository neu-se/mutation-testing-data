  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Number.isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `!Number.isFinite` would always return `true` if the argument is not a finite number, while `Number.isFinite` would return `false` in that case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isNaN` would return `true` if the argument is NaN, while `!Number.isFinite` would return `true` for any non-finite number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isSafeInteger
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isSafeInteger` would return `true` if the argument is a safe integer, while `!Number.isFinite` would return `true` for any non-finite number.

DONE.
