  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === false ? null : abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it would flip the logic of the conditional operator, causing the onEnd function to be called with a null value instead of the original value of abort.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort !== true ? null : abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the strict inequality operator (===) instead of the weak inequality operator (==), which could cause the onEnd function to be called with a non-null value if abort is not a boolean value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort ? null : abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the logical NOT operator (!) instead of the strict equality operator (===), which could cause the onEnd function to be called with a non-null value if abort is not a boolean value.

DONE.
