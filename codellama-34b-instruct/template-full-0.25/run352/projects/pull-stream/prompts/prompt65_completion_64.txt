  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(null, end)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `done` callback with `null` as the first argument, which would indicate that the operation was successful, even if it was not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(end, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `done` callback with `end` as the first argument, which would indicate that the operation was not successful, even if it was.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `done` callback with `null` as both arguments, which would indicate that the operation was successful, but it would not provide any data.

DONE.
