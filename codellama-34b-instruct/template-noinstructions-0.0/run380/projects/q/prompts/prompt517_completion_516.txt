  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method is called instead of `resolve`, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the `notify` method is called instead of `resolve`, which would cause the promise to be notified instead of resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` method is called with an argument, which would cause the promise to be resolved with a value instead of being resolved without a value.

DONE.
