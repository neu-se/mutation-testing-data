  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different argument to the `pull` function, which could potentially cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different argument to the `pull` function, which could potentially cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different argument to the `pull` function, which could potentially cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
