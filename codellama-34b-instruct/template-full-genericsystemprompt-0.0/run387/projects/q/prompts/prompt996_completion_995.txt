  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function is not called, which means that the promise will not be resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function is called with `undefined` as the argument, which means that the promise will be resolved with the value `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function is called with a function that does not have any side effects, which means that the promise will be resolved with the value `undefined`.

DONE.
