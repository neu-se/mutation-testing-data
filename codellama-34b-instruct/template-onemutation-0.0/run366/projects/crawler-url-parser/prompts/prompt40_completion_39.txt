  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host == null || baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical AND operator (`&&`), which requires both conditions to be true, while the new code fragment uses the logical OR operator (`||`), which only requires one condition to be true. This change would cause the function to return a different value when the `parsedUrl.host` is null, which could potentially cause issues in the code that uses this function.

DONE.
