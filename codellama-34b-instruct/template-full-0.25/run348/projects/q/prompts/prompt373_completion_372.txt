  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function (e) {
    throw e;
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws the exception if `Q.onerror` is not defined, while this replacement always throws the exception, regardless of whether `Q.onerror` is defined or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function (e) {
    console.log(e);
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws the exception if `Q.onerror` is not defined, while this replacement always logs the exception to the console, regardless of whether `Q.onerror` is defined or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function (e) {
    return e;
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws the exception if `Q.onerror` is not defined, while this replacement
