  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort && abort !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `onAbort` is truthy and `abort` is not equal to `true`, while this replacement checks if `onAbort` is truthy and `abort` is not equal to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort && abort === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `onAbort` is truthy and `abort` is not equal to `true`, while this replacement checks if `onAbort` is truthy and `abort` is equal to `false`.
