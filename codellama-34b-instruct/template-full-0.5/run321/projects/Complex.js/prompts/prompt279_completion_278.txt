  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Math.cos` to calculate the cosine of the angle, while the replaced code fragment uses `Math.sin` to calculate the sine of the angle.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Math.cos` to calculate the cosine of the angle, while the replaced code fragment uses `Math.tan` to calculate the tangent of the angle.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.csc
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Math.cos` to calculate the cosine of the angle, while the replaced code fragment uses `Math.csc` to calculate the cosecans of the angle.

DONE.
