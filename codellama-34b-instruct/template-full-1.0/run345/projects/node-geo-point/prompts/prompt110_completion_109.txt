  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp` returns the base-e exponential function of the number, which is very different from the `Math.log` function which returns the natural logarithm of the number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(2, x)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.pow(2, x)` returns the value of 2 raised to the power of x, which is very different from the `Math.log` function which returns the natural logarithm of the number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(x, y)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan2(x, y)` returns the angle in the range of -π to π, which is very different from the `Math.log` function which returns the natural logarithm of the number.

DONE.
