  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit("Invalid Param");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always throw an error, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit("Invalid Param" + a);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error with a custom message that includes the input parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(new Error("Invalid Param"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw a custom error object, which could be caught and handled differently.

DONE.
