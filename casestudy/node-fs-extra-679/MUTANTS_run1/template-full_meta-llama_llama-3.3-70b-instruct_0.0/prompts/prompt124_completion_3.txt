Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
cb(new Error('Unexpected error'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces an error that was not present in the original code, potentially masking other issues or causing the program to fail unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
cb(null, srcStat)
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the `srcStat` instead of simply calling the callback function `cb`, potentially causing the program to continue execution with incorrect data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the callback function `cb` with a success indicator (`null`) but without providing any additional data, potentially causing the program to continue execution without the necessary information.

DONE.
