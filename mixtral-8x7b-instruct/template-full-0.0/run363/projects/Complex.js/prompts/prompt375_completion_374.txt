 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` returns the cosine of a number, while `cosh` returns the hyperbolic cosine of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because it would flip the sign of the result, as well as potentially introduce division by zero errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(a / 2) * Math.exp(-a / 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to 1, regardless of the input, due to the cancellation of the exponential terms.

DONE.
