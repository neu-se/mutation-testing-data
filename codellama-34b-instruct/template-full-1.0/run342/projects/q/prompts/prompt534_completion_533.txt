  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("This is a buggy code fragment");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error, which the original code did not do.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Promise.reject(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise, which the original code did not do.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Promise.resolve(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with the reason, which the original code did not do.

DONE.
