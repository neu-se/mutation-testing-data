  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `b === null` would check if `b` is null, while `typeof b !== 'object'` checks if `b` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b instanceof Object
```
This would result in different behavior because `b instanceof Object` would check if `b` is an instance of the `Object` class, while `typeof b !== 'object'` checks if `b` is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!b || typeof b !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because `!b || typeof b !== 'object'` would check if `b` is falsy or not an object, while `typeof b !== 'object'` checks if `b` is not an object.

DONE.
