Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).html().trim();
```
This would result in different behavior because it retrieves the HTML content of the element instead of the text content, which may include HTML tags and not just the plain text.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('title').trim();
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to get the value of the `title` attribute of the element instead of its text content, which may not be present and could lead to different results in the `text` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().toUpperCase().trim();
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the text content to uppercase before trimming it, which changes the original casing of the text and may affect how it is processed or displayed later.

DONE.
