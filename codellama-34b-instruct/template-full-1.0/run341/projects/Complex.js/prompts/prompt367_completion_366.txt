  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` and `Math.sin` are different functions with different return values, and `Math.sin` is not a correct replacement for `Math.cos` in the given context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a constant representing the mathematical constant pi, and it is not a correct replacement for `Math.cos` in the given context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c => c + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the lambda function passed to `atanh` must be a continuous function on its domain, which `c => c + 1` is not. The `atanh` function is used to compute the inverse hyperbolic tangent of a complex number, and it is not well-defined for all complex numbers.

DONE.
