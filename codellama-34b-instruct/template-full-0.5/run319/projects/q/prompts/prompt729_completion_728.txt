  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new array containing all but the first element of the `promises` array, rather than the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.concat([])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new array containing all the elements of the `promises` array followed by an empty array, rather than the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.filter(function() { return true; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new array containing only the elements of the `promises` array that pass the filter function, which would always return true for all elements, resulting in the original array.

DONE.
