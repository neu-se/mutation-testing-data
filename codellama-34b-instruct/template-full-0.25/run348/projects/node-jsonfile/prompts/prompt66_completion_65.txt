  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\u0000/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match a null character at the beginning of the string, rather than the UTF-8 BOM.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\uFEFF\u0000/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match the UTF-8 BOM followed by a null character, rather than just the BOM.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\uFEFF\u0001/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match the UTF-8 BOM followed by a non-null character, rather than just the BOM.

DONE.
