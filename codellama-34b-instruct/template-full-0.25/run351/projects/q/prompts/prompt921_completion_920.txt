  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs).then
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called instead of the `fail` method, which would cause the promise to resolve instead of rejecting.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs).catch
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch` method is called instead of the `fail` method, which would cause the promise to reject with a different error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs).finally
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finally` method is called instead of the `fail` method, which would cause the promise to resolve or reject regardless of the outcome of the `fapply` method.

DONE.
