  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err
```
This would result in different behavior because `err` is always truthy, so the `else` branch would never be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because `err` is always truthy, so the `else` branch would always be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because `err` is always truthy, so the `else` branch would always be executed.

DONE.
