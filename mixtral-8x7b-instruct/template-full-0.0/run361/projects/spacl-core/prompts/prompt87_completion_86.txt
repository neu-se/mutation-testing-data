 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
rule.clone(rule.name)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the original rule's name instead of a new name for the cloned rule, potentially causing issues if the rule names need to be unique.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
rule.clone(<string>(Math.random() * 100))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would generate random names for the cloned rules, which could lead to naming conflicts or unpredictable behavior in the system.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
rule.clone(name, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new policy without cloning the underlying rules, which could lead to unintended side effects if the original rules are modified later.

DONE.
