  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref[1]` is a different value than `ref[0]`, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref[0] + 1` is a different value than `ref[0]`, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref[0] * 2` is a different value than `ref[0]`, which could cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
