  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the entire otherOp object, rather than just the `delete` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the entire otherOp object, rather than just the `delete` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the `delete` property of the otherOp object, rather than just the entire object.

DONE.
