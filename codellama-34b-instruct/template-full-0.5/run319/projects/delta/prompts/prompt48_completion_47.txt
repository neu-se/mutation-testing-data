  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType !== Object.keys(b)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when `embedType` is not equal to `Object.keys(b)[0]`, even if `b` is not an object or if `b` does not have any keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!embedType || embedType !== Object.keys(b)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when `embedType` is not equal to `Object.keys(b)[0]`, even if `b` is not an object or if `b` does not have any keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!embedType || !b || Object.keys(b)[0] !== embedType
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when `embedType` is not equal to `Object.keys(b)[0]
