  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, str.toUpperCase(), options
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would change the content of the file being written, which could cause issues if the file is being read by another process that expects the original content.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, str + 'hello world', options
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would concatenate the string 'hello world' to the end of the `str` variable, which could cause issues if the file is being read by another process that expects the original content.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, str.split(' ').join(''), options
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` and `join()` methods would remove all spaces from the `str` variable, which could cause issues if the file is being read by another process that expects the original content.

DONE.
