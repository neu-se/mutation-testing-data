  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 3) + 'es' }
```
This change would result in different behavior because it would remove an unnecessary character from the input string, resulting in a different output for one of the test cases that uses "thesis" as a test input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 5) + 'es' }
```
This change would result in different behavior because it would remove too many characters from the input string, resulting in a different output for both "thesis" and "crisis" test inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/XXXX|crisis/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'es' }
```
This change would result in
