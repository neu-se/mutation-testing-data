 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
iter.peekType() !== 'Insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it is case-sensitive and would not match the lowercase 'insert' in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
iter.peekType() !== 'insert' && iter.peekType() !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the undefined case, which might not be intended and could lead to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
iter.peekType() !== 'character'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for a different string, which would cause the following block to never execute, as the `peekType()` method would never return 'character'.

DONE.
