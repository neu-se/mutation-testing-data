  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
while (true) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never terminate, causing the program to hang indefinitely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
while (false) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute, causing the program to skip over any code that would have been executed inside the loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
while (null) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop condition would always evaluate to false, causing the program to skip over any code that would have been executed inside the loop.

DONE.
