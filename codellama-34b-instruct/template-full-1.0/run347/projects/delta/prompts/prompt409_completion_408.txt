  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return baseIndex + (length - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code correctly handles the case where the delta is a singleton operation, whereas the modified code would always return a value that is one less than the original base index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return baseIndex + (length + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code correctly handles the case where the delta is a singleton operation, whereas the modified code would always return a value that is one more than the original base index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return baseIndex + (length % 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code correctly handles the case where the delta is a singleton operation, whereas the modified code would always return a value that is either the same as the original base index or one less than the original base index, depending on whether the length is even or odd.

DONE.
