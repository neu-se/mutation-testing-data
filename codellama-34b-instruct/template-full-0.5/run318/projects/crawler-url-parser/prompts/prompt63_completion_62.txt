  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.hostname
```
This would result in different behavior because `ret.hostname` returns the hostname of the URL, whereas `ret.host` returns the hostname and the port number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.protocol + "//" + ret.host
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the full URL, including the protocol and the hostname, whereas `ret.host` only returns the hostname.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.host.split(":")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the hostname without the port number, whereas `ret.host` returns the full hostname and port number.

DONE.
