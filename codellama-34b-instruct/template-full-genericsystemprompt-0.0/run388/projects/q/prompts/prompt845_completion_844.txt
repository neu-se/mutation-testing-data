  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ms, new Error("Timeout error")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always reject the promise with a new error object, regardless of whether the original promise was fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ms, error.message
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with the message of the original error, rather than the error object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ms, error.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with the stack trace of the original error, rather than the error object itself.

DONE.
