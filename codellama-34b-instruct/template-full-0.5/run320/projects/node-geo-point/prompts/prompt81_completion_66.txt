  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the latitude instead of the longitude, which could lead to errors in the calculation of the destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 180 degrees to the longitude, which could lead to errors in the calculation of the destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the longitude, which could lead to errors in the calculation of the destination point.

DONE.
