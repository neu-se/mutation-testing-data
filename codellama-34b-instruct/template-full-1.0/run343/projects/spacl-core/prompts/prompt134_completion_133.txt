  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this.verbs[verb] !== true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if a verb is in the `this.verbs` object, while this new code checks if the value for the verb in the `this.verbs` object is not `true`. This could cause the `clone` method to produce different results for certain inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this.verbs.includes(verb))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if a verb is in the `this.verbs` object, while this new code checks if the `this.verbs` object includes the verb. This could cause the `clone` method to produce different results for certain inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this.verbs.hasOwnProperty(verb))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if a verb is in the `this.
