  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(value) {
    return value;
}, function(reason) {
    return reason;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the `promise` object, but the callback functions are not actually used to handle the fulfillment or rejection of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(value) {
    return value * 2;
}, function(reason) {
    return reason;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the `promise` object, but the callback functions are not actually used to handle the fulfillment or rejection of the promise. Additionally, the `value` parameter is multiplied by 2, which would change the resolved value of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(value) {
    return value
