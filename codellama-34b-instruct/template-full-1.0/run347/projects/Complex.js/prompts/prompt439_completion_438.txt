  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```this['re'] * 10```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply `this['re']` by 10, whereas the original code fragment multiplies it by `places`, which is a parameter of the `floor` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```this['re'] - 10```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 10 from `this['re']`, whereas the original code fragment adds 10 to it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```this['re'] / 10```
This would result in different behavior because it would divide `this['re']` by 10, whereas the original code fragment multiplies it by 10.

DONE.
