  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.forEach
```
This would result in different behavior because `forEach` does not return a new array, unlike `map` which returns a new array containing the results of calling a provided function on every element in the caller array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` returns a new array containing only the elements that satisfy the provided predicate, unlike `map` which returns a new array containing the results of calling a provided function on every element in the caller array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.reduce
```
This would result in different behavior because `reduce` returns a single value generated by iterating over the elements of the caller array, unlike `map` which returns a new array containing the results of calling a provided function on every element in the caller array.

DONE.
