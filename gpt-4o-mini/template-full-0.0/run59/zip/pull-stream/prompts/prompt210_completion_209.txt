Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the callback with a `null` value instead of the `aborted` error, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the abort condition in the calling code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb('error')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the callback with a string `'error'` instead of the actual `aborted` error, which could mislead the caller about the nature of the error and how to handle it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb && abortCb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `abortCb` with a `null` value instead of the `aborted` error, which would prevent the caller from receiving the correct abort reason and could lead to confusion in error handling.

DONE.
