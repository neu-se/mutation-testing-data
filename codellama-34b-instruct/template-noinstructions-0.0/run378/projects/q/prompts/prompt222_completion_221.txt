  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the prototype of the `defer` function, which could affect how the `defer` function is called and how it behaves.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.prototype.constructor
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the constructor of the `defer` function, which could affect how the `defer` function is called and how it behaves.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.prototype.constructor.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the prototype of the `constructor` function, which could affect how the `defer` function is called and how it behaves.

DONE.
