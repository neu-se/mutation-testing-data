  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (let i = 0; i < this._data.size; i++) {
  const key = this._data.keys()[i];
  const val = this._data.values()[i];

```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a traditional `for` loop over a `Map` object, rather than the `of` keyword, which may cause the loop to iterate over the map in a different order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (let [key, val] of this._data.entries()) {
  // ...
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `entries()` method to iterate over the map's entries, rather than the `keys()` method, which may cause the loop to iterate over the map in a different order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (let [key, val] of this._data.iterator()) {
  // ...
}
```
