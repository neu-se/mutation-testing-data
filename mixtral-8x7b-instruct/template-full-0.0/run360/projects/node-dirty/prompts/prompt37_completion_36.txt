 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._data.clear()
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes all key-value pairs from the `_data` map, which is not the behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._data.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns an iterator for the values of the `_data` map, instead of iterating over the key-value pairs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._queue
```
This would result in different behavior because it iterates over the `_queue` map instead of the `_data` map, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the `forEach` method.

DONE.
