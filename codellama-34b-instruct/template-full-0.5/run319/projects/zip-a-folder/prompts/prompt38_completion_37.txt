  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isGlob
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the condition, causing the code to enter the `if` block even if `src` is not a glob.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would explicitly check if `isGlob` is `false`, causing the code to enter the `if` block even if `src` is not a glob.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob && false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false`, causing the code to enter the `else` block even if `src` is a glob.

DONE.
