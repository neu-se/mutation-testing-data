  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criteria'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a singular noun, while the replaced code fragment is a plural noun.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criteriona'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a singular noun, while the replaced code fragment is a plural noun with an additional letter "a" at the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterion' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a singular noun, while the replaced code fragment is a plural noun with an additional "s" at the end.

DONE.
