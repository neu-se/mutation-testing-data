Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always take the larger length between the two iterators, potentially causing incorrect transformations when one operation is shorter than the other.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add one to the length of the current operation, which could lead to out-of-bounds errors or incorrect transformations when the length is already at its maximum.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reduce the length by one, which could cause the transformation to skip over parts of the operations, leading to data loss or incorrect results in the final delta.

DONE.
