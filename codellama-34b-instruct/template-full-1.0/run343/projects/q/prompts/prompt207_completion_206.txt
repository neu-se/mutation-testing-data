  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "undefined" &&
            typeof window.console.warn === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the PLACEHOLDER checks for the presence of the `console` object in the global scope, while the modified code fragment checks for the presence of the `window` object in the global scope, which may not be available in all execution environments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof global !== "undefined" &&
            typeof global.console.warn === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the PLACEHOLDER checks for the presence of the `console` object in the global scope, while the modified code fragment checks for the presence of the `global` object in the global scope, which may not be available in all execution environments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process !== "undefined" &&
            typeof process.stderr === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the PLACE
