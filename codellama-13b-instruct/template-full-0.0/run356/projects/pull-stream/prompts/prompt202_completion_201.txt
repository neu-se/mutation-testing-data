  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function would be called with the `abort` argument, which could cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called with the `abort` argument, which could cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called with the `null` argument, which could cause the test to fail.

DONE.
