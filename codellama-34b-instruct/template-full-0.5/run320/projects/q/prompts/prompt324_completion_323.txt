  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fallback.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` is a method that invokes a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided as an array, while `call` is a method that invokes a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided individually. Using `apply` instead of `call` could cause the function to be called with the wrong `this` value or arguments, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fallback.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` is a method that creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` value set to the first argument and the arguments provided to bind as a pre-set arguments. Using `bind` instead of `call` could cause the function to be called with the wrong `this` value or arguments, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fallback.call(null)
```
This would
