  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` and `Math.cos` have different mathematical formulas, which would cause the calculations to produce different results, even though the input values are the same.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI + Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI + Math.cos` would return a slightly different value than `Math.cos`, which would cause the calculations to produce different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(y + x) - Math.cos(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculation would take place using a different formula than the original, which would cause the results to differ even though the input values are the same.

DONE.
