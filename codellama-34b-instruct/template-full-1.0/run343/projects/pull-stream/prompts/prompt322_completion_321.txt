  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a && onEnd
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the short-circuiting behavior of the `||` operator. In the original code, `a || !onEnd` is only true if `a` is truthy or `onEnd` is falsy. In the modified code, `a && onEnd` is only true if both `a` and `onEnd` are truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!a || onEnd
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the short-circuiting behavior of the `||` operator again. In the original code, `a || !onEnd` is only true if `a` is truthy or `onEnd` is falsy. In the modified code, `!a || onEnd` is only true if `a` is falsy or `onEnd` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a != onEnd
