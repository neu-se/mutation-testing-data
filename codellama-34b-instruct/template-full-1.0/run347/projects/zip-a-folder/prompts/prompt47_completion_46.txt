  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src[0], true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `src` array is being passed to the `directory` method with the `recursive` option set to `true`, which will result in a different compression ratio.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.length - 1, false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `src` array is being passed to the `directory` method with a modified length and the `recursive` option set to `false`, which will result in a different compression ratio.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value is being passed to the `directory` method with the `recursive` option set to `true`, which will result in a different compression ratio.

DONE.
