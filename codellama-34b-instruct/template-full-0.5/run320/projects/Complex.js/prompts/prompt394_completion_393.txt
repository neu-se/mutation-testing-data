  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the complex cosh, while the mutated code fragment calculates the complex sech.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the complex tanh, while the mutated code fragment calculates the complex coth.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the complex csch, while the mutated code fragment calculates the complex sech.

DONE.
