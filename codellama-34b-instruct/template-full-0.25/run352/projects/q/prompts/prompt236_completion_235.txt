  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch.apply(undefined, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `promiseDispatch` method on `undefined` instead of `resolvedPromise`, which would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch.apply(null, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `promiseDispatch` method on `null` instead of `resolvedPromise`, which would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch.apply(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `promiseDispatch` method on `args` instead of `resolvedPromise`, which would cause an error.

DONE.
