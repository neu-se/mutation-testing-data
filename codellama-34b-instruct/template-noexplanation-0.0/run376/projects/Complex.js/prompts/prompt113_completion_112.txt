  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this instanceof Complex
```
This code fragment is a valid replacement for the PLACEHOLDER, as it checks whether the `this` object is an instance of the `Complex` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.constructor === Complex
```
This code fragment is another valid replacement for the PLACEHOLDER, as it checks whether the `this` object's constructor is the `Complex` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.getPrototypeOf(this) === Complex.prototype
```
This code fragment is another valid replacement for the PLACEHOLDER, as it checks whether the `this` object's prototype is the `Complex` prototype object.

DONE.
