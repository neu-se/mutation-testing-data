  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the function itself as the first argument to `Q.nfapply`, instead of passing the arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the third argument of the `Q.nfapply` function as the second argument to the `callback` function, instead of passing the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 3
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the fourth argument of the `Q.nfapply` function as the third argument to the `callback` function, instead of passing the third argument.

DONE.
