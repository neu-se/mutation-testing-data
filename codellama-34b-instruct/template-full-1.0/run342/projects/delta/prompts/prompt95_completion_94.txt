  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` will add the new op to the end of the `ops` array, whereas `splice` would insert it at the specified index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.unshift(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` would add the new op to the beginning of the `ops` array, whereas `splice` would insert it at the specified index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(index + 1, 0, newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the new op at the specified index + 1 instead of the specified index.

DONE.
