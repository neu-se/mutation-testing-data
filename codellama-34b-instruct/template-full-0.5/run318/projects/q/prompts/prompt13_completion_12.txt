  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.ng()
```
This would result in different behavior because `ses.ng()` is not a valid function in the SES library, and would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.ok() && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression would now evaluate to `false`, which would cause the `if` statement to be skipped.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.ok() || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression would now evaluate to `true`, which would cause the `if` statement to be executed.

DONE.
