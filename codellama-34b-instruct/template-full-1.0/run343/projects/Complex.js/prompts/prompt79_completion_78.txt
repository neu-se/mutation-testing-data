  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === ' ' || c === '\t' || c === '\n'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the presence of whitespace characters, while the replacement fragment checks for the presence of a specific set of characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b != 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the presence of whitespace characters, while the replacement fragment checks for the equality of `b` with 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNaN(c)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the presence of whitespace characters, while the replacement fragment checks for the value of `c` to be a number.

DONE.
