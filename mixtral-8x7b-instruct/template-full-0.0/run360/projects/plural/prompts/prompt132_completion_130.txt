 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
rule[0].constructor.name
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the constructor's name of the rule is equal to 'RegExp' instead of checking if the rule itself is a RegExp object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
rule[0] instanceof RegExp
