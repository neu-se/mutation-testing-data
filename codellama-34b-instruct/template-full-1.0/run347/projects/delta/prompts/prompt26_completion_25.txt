  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of values in the object, whereas `Object.keys` returns an array of the object's property names (keys).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries` returns an array of [key, value] pairs for each property in the object, whereas `Object.keys` and `Object.values` return separate arrays.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(<object>, <key>)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the object has the specified property, whereas `Object.keys` and `Object.values` return information about the object's properties regardless of whether they are inherited or not.

DONE.
