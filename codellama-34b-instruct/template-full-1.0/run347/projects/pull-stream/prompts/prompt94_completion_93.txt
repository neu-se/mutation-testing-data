  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that is distinct from `null`, which could cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a special value in JavaScript that is used to represent "NOT A NUMBER". It is distinct from `null` and could cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object, which is not a primitive value, and could cause the code to behave differently in certain situations. For example, if the code is expecting a primitive value, it may throw an error when an object is passed instead.

DONE.
