  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) {
    return _fulfilled(value);
}, function (exception) {
    return _rejected(exception);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the result of the `_fulfilled` or `_rejected` function, rather than the original value or exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) {
    return _rejected(value);
}, function (exception) {
    return _fulfilled(exception);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the result of the `_rejected` function, rather than the original value or exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) {
    return _fulfilled(value);
}, function (exception) {
    return _fulfilled(exception
