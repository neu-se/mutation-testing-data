  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the product of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number instead of the sum, which is the correct behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] - this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the difference of the imaginary and real parts of the complex number instead of the sum, which is the correct behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(this['re']) + Math.abs(this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the sum of the absolute values of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number instead of the sum of the real and imaginary parts, which is the correct behavior.

DONE.
