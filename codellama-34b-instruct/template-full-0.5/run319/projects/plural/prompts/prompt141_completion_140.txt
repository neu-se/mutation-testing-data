  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word, rule[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second element of the `rule` array is a function that is applied to the `word` argument, whereas the first element is a string that is compared to the `word` argument. By using `rule[1]` instead of `rule[0]`, the function would be applied to the `word` argument, which would result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word, rule[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the third element of the `rule` array is a function that is applied to the `word` argument, whereas the first two elements are strings that are compared to the `word` argument. By using `rule[2]` instead of `rule[0]`, the function would be applied to the `word` argument, which would result in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word, rule[3]
```
This would result in
