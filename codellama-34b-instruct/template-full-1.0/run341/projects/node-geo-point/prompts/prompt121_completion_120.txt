  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER in the code with different buggy code fragments:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return 180 - GeoPoint.calculateBearing(point);
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing calculation would be inverted, causing the calculateBearing function to return the opposite bearing than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return GeoPoint.calculateBearing(point) + 180;
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing calculation would be offset by 180 degrees, causing the calculateBearing function to return a bearing that is shifted by 180 degrees from the expected bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return GeoPoint.calculateBearing(point) * 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing calculation would be multiplied by 2, causing the calculateBearing function to
