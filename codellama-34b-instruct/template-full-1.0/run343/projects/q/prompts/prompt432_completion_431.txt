  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER> throw new Error();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not throw an error, while the replacement does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER> untrackRejection(this);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not call the `untrackRejection` function, while the replacement does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER> trackUnhandledRejections = true;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not modify the value of the `trackUnhandledRejections` variable, while the replacement does.

DONE.
