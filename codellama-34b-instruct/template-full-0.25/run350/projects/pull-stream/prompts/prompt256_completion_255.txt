  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read = stream
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the `stream` variable to `_read`, rather than the `read` function. This would cause the `nextChunk` function to be called with the wrong argument, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read = stream.read
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the `read` method of the `stream` object to `_read`, rather than the `read` function. This would cause the `nextChunk` function to be called with the wrong argument, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read = function() { return stream.read(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign a new function to `_read`, rather than the `read` function. This would cause the `nextChunk` function to be called with the wrong argument, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.
