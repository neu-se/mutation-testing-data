 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
policy.query
```
This would result in different behavior because the `matches` method is supposed to check if a path is governed by a policy, whereas `query` method checks whether an action is allowed on a path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
policy.name
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `matches` method on the `policy` object, whereas the replacement code fragment references the `name` property of the `policy` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
policy.matches.bind(null)
