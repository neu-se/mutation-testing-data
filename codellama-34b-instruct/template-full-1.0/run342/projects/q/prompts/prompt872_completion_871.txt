  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would return the number 1 instead of the intended value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would return the string "hello" instead of the intended value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would return an empty function instead of the intended value.

DONE.
