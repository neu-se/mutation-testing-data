  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!unique
```
This would result in different behavior because `!unique` is the negation of `unique`, so it would return `false` when the item is unique and `true` when it's not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unique.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `unique.length` would return the length of the `unique` array, which is not the same as checking if the item is unique.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unique.indexOf(field)
```
This would result in different behavior because `unique.indexOf(field)` would return the index of the first occurrence of `field` in the `unique` array, which is not the same as checking if the item is unique.

DONE.
