 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 * <bearing>
```
This would result in different behavior because it always multiplies the bearing by 1, which doesn't change the value but could introduce a redundant operation, possibly affecting how the code is optimized and executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.round(<bearing>)
```
This would result in different behavior because it rounds the bearing to the nearest integer, which could affect the precision of the calculated destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(<bearing>)
```
This would result in different behavior because it always takes the absolute value of the bearing, which could lead to incorrect results when calculating the destination point if the bearing is supposed to be negative.

DONE.
