 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps the `fulfilled` function in an arrow function, which may affect the `this` context or not properly pass any arguments if the `when` function expects a regular function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.max
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `fulfilled` identifier with the built-in `Math.max` function, causing a type error and changing the behavior of the `when` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly calls the `deferred.resolve` function, bypassing the `fulfilled` function and changing the behavior of the `when` function.

DONE.
