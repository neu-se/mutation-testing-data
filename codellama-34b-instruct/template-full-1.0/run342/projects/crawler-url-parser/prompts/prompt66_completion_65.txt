  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.search.split(/\?/)[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the search string into an array based on the "?" character, and then return the second element of the array, which would be the string after the "?" character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.search.split(/\&/).pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the search string into an array based on the "&" character, and then return the last element of the array, which would be the string after the last "&" character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.search.replace(/\?/g, '').split(/\&/)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would first remove any "?" character from the search string, and then split the remaining string into an array based on the "&" character.

DONE.
