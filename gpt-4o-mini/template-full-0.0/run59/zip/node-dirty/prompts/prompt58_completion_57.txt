Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately end the write stream without waiting for all in-flight writes to complete, potentially leading to data loss if there are pending writes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', 'extra data');
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits the 'drain' event with an additional argument, which could cause any listeners expecting a specific signature to behave incorrectly or throw errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.resume();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to resume reading from the stream, which is not appropriate in the context of closing the database, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

DONE.
