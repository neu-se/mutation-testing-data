  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
all
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` and `any` are different methods in the `Q` library, and they have different behavior when dealing with arrays of promises. `all` returns a promise that is fulfilled when all promises in the array are fulfilled, while `any` returns a promise that is fulfilled when any of the promises in the array is fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
none
```
This would result in different behavior because `none` is not a method in the `Q` library, and it would cause a syntax error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
some
```
This would result in different behavior because `some` is not a method in the `Q` library, and it would cause a syntax error.

DONE.
