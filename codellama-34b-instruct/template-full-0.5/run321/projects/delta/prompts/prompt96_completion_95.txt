  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the splice method to insert the newOp at the wrong index, potentially resulting in the newOp being inserted in the middle of the ops array, rather than at the end.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the splice method to insert the newOp at the end of the ops array, rather than at the correct index based on the length of the ops array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() * this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the splice method to insert the newOp at a random index in the ops array, which could result in the newOp being inserted in the middle of the array, or even outside of the array bounds, potentially causing errors or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
