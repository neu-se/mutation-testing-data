  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new RegExp('\\b(?:' + tools.concat(clothes, games, illnesses, misc).join('|') + ')\\b', 'i')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment includes the 's' at the end of each word, while this new code fragment does not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new RegExp('\\b(?:' + tools.concat(clothes, games, illnesses, misc).join('|') + ')\\b', 'g')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the 'i' flag, which makes the regular expression case-insensitive, while this new code fragment uses the 'g' flag, which makes the regular expression global.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new RegExp('\\b(?:' + tools.concat(clothes, games, illnesses, misc).join('|')
