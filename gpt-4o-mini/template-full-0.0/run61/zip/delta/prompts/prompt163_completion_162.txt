Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always push an operation with a length of 0, effectively ignoring the actual length of the operation being processed, which could lead to incorrect composition of operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push an operation with a length that is one greater than the actual retain value, potentially causing an off-by-one error in the resulting delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push an operation based on the delete property of the other operation instead of the expected insert length, which could lead to incorrect handling of the operations during composition.

DONE.
