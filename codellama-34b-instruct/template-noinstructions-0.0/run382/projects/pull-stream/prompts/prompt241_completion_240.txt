  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the `data` parameter passed to the callback function, while `null` is a literal value that does not have the same reference.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the `data` parameter passed to the callback function, while `undefined` is a literal value that does not have the same reference.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"data"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the `data` parameter passed to the callback function, while `"data"` is a string literal that does not have the same reference.

DONE.
