  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options.url` property is not the same as the `options.dest` property, which is used in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options.dest` property is now being concatenated with the string `'foo'`, which would change the output of the `path.join` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path.dirname` function returns the directory name of the path, while the original code fragment uses the `path.basename` function to get the file name.

DONE.
