  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1/0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would have returned a result, while the modified code would throw a division by zero error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would have returned the tangent of the angle, while the modified code would return the cosine of the angle.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tanh
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would have returned the tangent of the angle, while the modified code would return the hyperbolic tangent of the angle.

DONE.
