 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finally` callback would receive `null` instead of the original promise object. This could cause issues if the callback expects the `promise` object to call methods or access properties on it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finally` callback would receive the context (`this`) of the calling scope instead of the original promise object. This could cause issues if the callback expects the `promise` object to call methods or access properties on it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finally` callback would receive a resolved promise instead of the original promise object. This could cause issues if the callback expects the `promise` object to call methods or access properties on it, or if it relies on the state of the original promise.
