 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.assign({}, baseOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of `baseOp`, which might not behave the same way as the original `baseOp` in certain scenarios, especially if the original object contains nested objects or properties that are being mutated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
baseOp.slice(0)
