  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' && newOp.insert != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the last operation is a retain operation and the new operation is an insert operation, which is not the same as checking if the last operation is a delete operation and the new operation is an insert operation.
