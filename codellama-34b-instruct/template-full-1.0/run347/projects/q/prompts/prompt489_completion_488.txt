  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return "unhandledRejections.length == 0";
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true, regardless of the actual number of unhandled rejections, leading to incorrect tracking of unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return "unhandledReasons.length == -1";
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return false, regardless of the actual number of unhandled reasons, leading to incorrect tracking of unhandled rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return "trackUnhandledRejections == true";
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true, regardless of whether tracking unhandled rejections was actually enabled or not, leading to inconsistent tracking of unhandled rejections.

DONE.
