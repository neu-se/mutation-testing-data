  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `!(Array.isArray(ops))`

This would result in different behavior because it would negate the check for whether the `ops` parameter is an array, potentially allowing the `Delta` class to be instantiated with a non-array value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `ops.length === 0`

This would result in different behavior because it would check whether the `ops` parameter has a length of zero, rather than checking whether it is an array. If the intention is to allow the `Delta` class to be instantiated with an empty array, this change would be appropriate. However, if the intention is to ensure that the `ops` parameter is an array, this change would result in a different check.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `typeof ops === 'undefined'`

This would result in different behavior because it would check whether the `ops` parameter is undefined, rather than checking whether it is an array. If the intention is to allow the `Delta` class to be instantiated with no arguments
