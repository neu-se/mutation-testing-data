  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_lastIndexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_lastIndexOf` returns the index of the last occurrence of the specified value in the array, whereas `array_indexOf` returns the index of the first occurrence. This would cause the `untrackRejection` function to remove the wrong rejection from the `unhandledRejections` array, potentially leading to incorrect handling of unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_includes` returns a boolean indicating whether the specified value is present in the array, whereas `array_indexOf` returns the index of the first occurrence. This would cause the `untrackRejection` function to remove the rejection from the `unhandledRejections` array even if it is not actually present, potentially leading to incorrect handling of unhandled rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_findIndex
```
