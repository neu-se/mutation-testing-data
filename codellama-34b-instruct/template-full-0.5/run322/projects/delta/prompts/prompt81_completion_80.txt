  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` adds the newOp to the end of the array, while `unshift` adds it to the beginning.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes the last element of the array, while `shift` removes the first element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(0, 0, newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` adds the newOp to the beginning of the array, while `unshift` adds it to the end.

DONE.
