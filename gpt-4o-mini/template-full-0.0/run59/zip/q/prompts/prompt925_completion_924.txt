Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the context from the `Q` library to the native `Promise` object, which may not have the same methods or behavior as `Q`, potentially leading to unexpected results in promise handling.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly creates a rejected promise instead of calling the original function, which would bypass the intended execution flow and immediately return a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a resolved promise regardless of the input, which would ignore any errors or exceptions that might occur in the original function, leading to incorrect promise resolution.

DONE.
