  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.W_OK
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it checks for write permission instead of read permission.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.X_OK
```
This code fragment checks for execute permission instead of read permission.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.F_OK
```
This code fragment checks for the existence of the file instead of checking for read permission.

DONE.
