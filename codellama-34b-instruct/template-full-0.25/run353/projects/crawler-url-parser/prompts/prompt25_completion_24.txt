  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the empty string to remove the fragment from the URL, while the new code fragment uses the string '#' to remove the fragment. This could cause the URL to be parsed differently, potentially leading to different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the empty string to remove the fragment from the URL, while the new code fragment uses a single space character to remove the fragment. This could cause the URL to be parsed differently, potentially leading to different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#' + ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the empty string to remove the fragment from the URL, while the new code fragment uses a string consisting of the '#' character followed by a single space character to remove the fragment. This could cause the URL to be parsed differently, potentially leading to different results
