  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + '_bug'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a variable name, while the new fragment is a string concatenation of the variable name and the string '_bug'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() * 100
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a variable name, while the new fragment is a random number between 0 and 100.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a variable name, while the new fragment is undefined.

DONE.
