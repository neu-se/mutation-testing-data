 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.ops[this.index - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the previous Op in the ops array instead of the current one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Math.max(0, this.peekLength() - this.offset)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would limit the length to the remaining length of the current Op instead of allowing any length up to Infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.ops[this.index + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the next Op in the ops array instead of the current one.

DONE.
