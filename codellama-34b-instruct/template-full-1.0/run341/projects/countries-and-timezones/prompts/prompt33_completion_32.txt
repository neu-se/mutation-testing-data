  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```min > 60```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to always return a positive offset, even if the input offset is negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```min + 60```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to always return an offset that is 60 minutes greater than the input offset.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```min - 60```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to always return an offset that is 60 minutes less than the input offset.

DONE.
