  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the length of the operation, which could cause the operation to be skipped or repeated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the length of the operation, which could cause the operation to be repeated or skipped.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the length of the operation, which could cause the operation to be repeated or skipped.

DONE.
