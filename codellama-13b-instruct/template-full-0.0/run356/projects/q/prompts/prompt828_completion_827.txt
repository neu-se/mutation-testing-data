  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.onerror` function is called with the error object as an argument, whereas the original code fragment does not pass any arguments to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.onerror` function is called with the error object as an argument, whereas the original code fragment does not pass any arguments to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror(error, promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.onerror` function is called with the error object and the promise as arguments, whereas the original code fragment does not pass any arguments to the function.

DONE.
