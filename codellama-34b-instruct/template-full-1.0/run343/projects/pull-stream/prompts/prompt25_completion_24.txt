  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function would be called with a different set of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function would be called with a different number of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function would be called with a different set of arguments.

DONE.
