  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.reverse().reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method would be called twice, which would essentially cancel out the first call, resulting in the original order of the array being preserved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.slice(0).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method would create a shallow copy of the original array, and then the `reverse()` method would be called on the copy, which would not affect the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.concat().reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat()` method would create a new array by concatenating the original array with an empty array, and then the `reverse()` method would be called on the new array, which would reverse the order of the elements in the new array, but not affect the original array.

DONE.
