Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("An error occurred");
```
This would result in different behavior because it immediately throws an error instead of calling the generator function, which would prevent the promise from being resolved and lead to an unhandled rejection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.resolve("Unexpected value");
```
This would result in different behavior because it resolves the promise with a string value instead of executing the generator, which changes the expected flow of the asynchronous operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(new Error("Promise rejected"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it rejects the promise immediately, bypassing the generator's execution and causing any subsequent code that relies on the generator's resolution to fail.

DONE.
