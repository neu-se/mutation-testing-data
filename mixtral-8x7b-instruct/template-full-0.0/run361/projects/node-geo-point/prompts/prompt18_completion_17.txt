 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof object !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it doesn't check for null values, unlike the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.prototype.toString.call(object) !== '[object Object]'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the object's internal `[[Class]]` property, which might not match the expected behavior for certain edge cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!Array.isArray(object) && object !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly allows arrays to be passed, while the original code fragment checks for objects only.

DONE.
