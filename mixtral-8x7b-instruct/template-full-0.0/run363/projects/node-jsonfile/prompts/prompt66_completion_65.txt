 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'^\\uFEFF'
```
This would result in different behavior because the backslash needs to be escaped in a regular expression literal, causing the code to look for a literal "\uFEFF" at the start of the string instead of the byte order mark (BOM).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'^\uFFEF'
```
This would result in different behavior because the Unicode code point for the BOM is incorrect, causing the code to look for a different character at the start of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'^\\u{FEFF}'
```
This would result in different behavior because the Unicode code point for the BOM is expressed using the Unicode escape syntax with curly braces, which is not supported in JavaScript regular expressions. This would cause the code to throw a syntax error.

DONE.
