  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to be used instead of `thisIter`, which could lead to incorrect results in the diffing algorithm.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `thisIter` to be used instead of `otherIter`, which could lead to incorrect results in the diffing algorithm.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to be used instead of `thisIter`, which could lead to incorrect results in the diffing algorithm.

DONE.
