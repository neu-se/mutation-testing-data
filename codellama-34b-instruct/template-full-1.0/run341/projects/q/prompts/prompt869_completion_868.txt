  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.delay` method expects a non-undefined value to be resolved, but `undefined` is a falsy value, which means it will be rejected and the promise will be in a rejected state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject('error')
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.delay` method expects a non-rejected promise to be returned, but `Promise.reject('error')` returns a rejected promise, which means the `Q.delay` method will throw an error and the promise will be in a rejected state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.delay` method expects a non-undefined value to be resolved, but `void 0` is a falsy value, which means it will be rejected and the promise will be in a rejected state.

DONE.
