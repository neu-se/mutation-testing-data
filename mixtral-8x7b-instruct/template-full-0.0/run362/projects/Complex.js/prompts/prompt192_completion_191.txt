 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the result of the power calculation would be incorrect when the base is an imaginary number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the result of the power calculation would be incorrect when the base is a complex number with a non-zero real part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the result of the power calculation would be incorrect when the exponent is a complex number with a non-zero imaginary part.

DONE.
