  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => seg - acc
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `+` operator to concatenate the `seg` and `acc` strings, while this replacement uses the `-` operator, which would result in a different string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => seg.concat(acc)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `+` operator to concatenate the `seg` and `acc` strings, while this replacement uses the `concat` method, which would result in a different string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => seg.replace(acc, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `+` operator to concatenate the `seg` and `acc` strings, while this replacement uses the `replace` method, which would result in a different string.

DONE.
