  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!messages
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `messages`, which is an array. If `messages` is truthy, `!messages` will evaluate to `false`, and if `messages` is falsy, `!messages` will evaluate to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `messages.length` is a number that represents the length of the `messages` array. If `messages.length` is greater than 0, the code would enter the `if` block and continue processing the promise resolution. If `messages.length` is 0, the code would not enter the `if` block and would skip over the rest of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `messages[0]` is the first element of the `messages` array. If `messages
