  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always compare the value of the same key in both objects, whereas the original code fragment compares the value of the key in the first object with the value of the same key in the second object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the value of the key in the first object with the value of the same key in the second object, whereas the original code fragment compares the value of the key in the first object with the value of the same key in the first object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] === b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the value of the key in the first object with the value of the same key in the second object, whereas the original code fragment compares the value of the key in the first object with the value of the
