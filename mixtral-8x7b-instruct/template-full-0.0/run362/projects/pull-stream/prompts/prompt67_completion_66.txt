 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison no longer checks if `end` is truthy, and only checks if `end` is strictly equal to `true`. This means that if `end` is a non-empty string, an array, or any other truthy value, the condition will still evaluate to `true`, potentially causing incorrect behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end == false
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison now checks if `end` is equal to `false`, instead of not equal to `true`. This means that if `end` is `null`, `0`, or any other falsy value that is not strictly equal to `false`, the condition will evaluate to `false`, potentially causing incorrect behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!op(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation operator (`!`) is now applied to the result of `
