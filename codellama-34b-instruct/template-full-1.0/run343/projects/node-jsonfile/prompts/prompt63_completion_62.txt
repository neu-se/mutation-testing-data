  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` returns a shallow copy of the buffer, while `toString` returns a string representation of the buffer. This difference in behavior could cause issues in the code that uses these functions.
DONE.
