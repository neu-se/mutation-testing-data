  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `null` instead of the expected timezone object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `undefined` instead of the expected timezone object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(tzName.toUpperCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a timezone object with a different name than the expected one.

DONE.
