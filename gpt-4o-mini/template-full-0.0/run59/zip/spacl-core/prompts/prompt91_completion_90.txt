Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.keys()` returns an iterator of the keys in the `Map`, rather than the `policies` array, leading to an attempt to set keys that do not correspond to any `Policy` objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `policies.slice(0, 1)` only takes the first policy from the array, meaning that only the first policy will be added to the `PolicyMap`, ignoring any subsequent policies.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[...policies].reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because reversing the `policies` array changes the order in which policies are added to the `PolicyMap`, which could affect the outcome of queries if the policies have overlapping or conflicting rules.

DONE.
