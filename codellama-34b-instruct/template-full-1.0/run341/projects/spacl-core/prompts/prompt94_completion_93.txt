  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the policy name is equal to the key, while this code checks the length of the policy name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the policy name is equal to the key, while this code checks if the uppercase version of the policy name is equal to the key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name + 'extra-text'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the policy name is equal to the key, while this code checks if the policy name plus some extra text is equal to the key.

DONE.
