  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.push(iter.next())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the entire `iter.next()` operation onto the `line` array, rather than just the `insert` property of the operation. This could cause the `line` array to contain operations that are not intended to be pushed onto it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.push(iter.next().insert)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the `insert` property of the `iter.next()` operation onto the `line` array, rather than the entire operation. This could cause the `line` array to contain only the `insert` properties of the operations, rather than the entire operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.push(iter.next().insert.slice(0, index))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push a slice of the `insert` property of the `iter.next()` operation onto the
