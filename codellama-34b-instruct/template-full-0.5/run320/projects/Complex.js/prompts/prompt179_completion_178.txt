  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, since `a + b` is always a non-zero value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, since `a - b` is always a zero or negative value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, since `a * b` is always a zero or negative value.

DONE.
