  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finish'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finish` event is emitted when the archive has been finalized and all data has been written, while the `close` event is emitted when the underlying file descriptor has been closed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` event is emitted when an error occurs while creating the archive, while the `close` event is emitted when the underlying file descriptor has been closed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` event is emitted when the archive has been finalized and all data has been written, while the `close` event is emitted when the underlying file descriptor has been closed.

DONE.
