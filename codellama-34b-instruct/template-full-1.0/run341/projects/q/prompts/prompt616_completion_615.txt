  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER in the provided code with a buggy code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the property `key` in `obj`, rather than the promise for the property value that the original code fragment would return.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.key
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the property `key` in `obj`, rather than the promise for the property value that the original code fragment would return.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.key()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would try to call the function `key` in `obj`, rather than return the promise for the property value that the original code fragment would return.

DONE.
