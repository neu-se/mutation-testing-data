 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
otherOp.delete = true;
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the `otherOp` object by setting its `delete` property to `true`, instead of calling the `delete` method on the `retDelta` object with the length of `otherOp`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
retDelta.push(otherOp.delete);
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes the `delete` property of `otherOp` onto `retDelta`, instead of the entire `otherOp` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
retDelta.push(otherOp).delete(otherOp.length);
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the `delete` method on the result of `retDelta.push(otherOp)`, which is the new length of `retDelta`, instead of the length of `otherOp`.

DONE.
