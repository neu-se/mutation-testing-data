Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < max
```
This would result in different behavior because it will return `cb(true)` when `i` is less than `max`, which is the opposite of the original condition, potentially allowing more iterations than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i === max
```
This would result in different behavior because it will return `cb(true)` when `i` is exactly equal to `max`, which means it will not allow the function to proceed when `i` reaches the maximum value, unlike the original condition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i >= max
```
This would result in different behavior because it will return `cb(true)` when `i` is greater than or equal to `max`, which could lead to an early termination of the counting process, differing from the original behavior where it only checks for strictly greater than.

DONE.
