  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
latitude === null || longitude === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `latitude` and `longitude` are not numbers, while this new code checks if they are `null`. If the `latitude` or `longitude` is `null`, the constructor will throw an error, even if they are valid numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
latitude < 0 || longitude < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `latitude` and `longitude` are less than -90 or 90, respectively, while this new code checks if they are less than 0. If the `latitude` or `longitude` is less than 0, the constructor will throw an error, even if they are valid numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof latitude !== 'number' && typeof longitude !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior
