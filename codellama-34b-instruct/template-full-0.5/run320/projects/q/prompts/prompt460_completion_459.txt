  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would check if the index of the `promise` in `unhandledRejections` is equal to -1, which would result in the opposite behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at < -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would check if the index of the `promise` in `unhandledRejections` is less than -1, which would never be true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would check if the index of the `promise` in `unhandledRejections` is greater than -1, which would always be true.

DONE.
