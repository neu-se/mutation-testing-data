 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method expects `thisp` to be the correct `this` value for the function call, but passing `null` would cause the function to be called without a proper `this` context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method expects `thisp` to be the correct `this` value for the function call, but passing an empty array would cause the function to be called as if it were a regular function, not a method of an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method expects `thisp` to be the correct `this` value for the function call, but passing an empty object would cause the function to be called with a different `this` value than intended.

DONE.
