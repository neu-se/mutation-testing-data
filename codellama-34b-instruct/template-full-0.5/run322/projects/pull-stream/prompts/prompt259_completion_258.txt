  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was not calling the `nextStream` function, but instead was referring to it as a value. By adding the parentheses and calling the function, the code would behave differently because it would execute the `nextStream` function, which would then execute the `nextChunk` function and potentially return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was referring to the `read` function, but the new code fragment is referring to the `_read` variable. This could cause the code to behave differently if the `_read` variable has a different value than the `read` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was calling the `read` function with two arguments, but the new code fragment is calling it with only one argument. This could cause
