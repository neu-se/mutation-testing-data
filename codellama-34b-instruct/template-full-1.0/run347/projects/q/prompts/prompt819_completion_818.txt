  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would not have a reference to the `progress` function, which is passed as a callback to the `Q.nextTick` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { throw new Error("test") }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would throw an error, causing the promise to be rejected, instead of calling the `Q.nextTick` function with the `progress` function as a callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { return 2 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different value (2) instead of calling the `Q.nextTick` function with the `progress` function as a callback.

DONE.
