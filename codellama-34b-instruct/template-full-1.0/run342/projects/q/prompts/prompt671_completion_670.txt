  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [args, void 0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `args` to `apply()` as the `this` value, which is the wrong order and would likely result in a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call", [void 0, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `call()` method on the `arguments` object, which is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call", [args, void 0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `args` to `call()` as the `this` value, which is not a function.

DONE.
