  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!p
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT, which returns `true` if its operand is falsy and `false` otherwise. In contrast, the `!!` operator is a double NOT, which converts its operand to a boolean value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is a logical AND, which returns `true` if both of its operands are truthy and `false` otherwise. In contrast, the `!!` operator is a double NOT, which converts its operand to a boolean value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p || false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is a logical OR, which returns `true` if either of its operands is truthy and `false` otherwise. In contrast, the `!!` operator is a double NOT, which converts its operand
