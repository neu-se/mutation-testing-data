  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath, fs.constants.R_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fs.constants.W_OK` flag is missing, which would prevent the function from checking for write access to the target directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath, fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fs.constants.R_OK` flag is missing, which would prevent the function from checking for read access to the target directory.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath, fs.constants.X_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fs.constants.X_OK` flag is not used in the original code, and would cause the function to check for execute permission on the target directory, which is not necessary for the function's intended behavior.

DONE.
