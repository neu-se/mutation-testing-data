  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This will cause the code to use the square root function instead of the power function, which will result in a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log
```
This will cause the code to use the natural logarithm function instead of the power function, which will result in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This will cause the code to use the sine function instead of the power function, which will result in a different output.

DONE.
