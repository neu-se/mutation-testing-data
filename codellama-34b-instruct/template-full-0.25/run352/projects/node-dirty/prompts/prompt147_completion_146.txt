  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let cb;
```
This would result in different behavior because `let` is a block-scoped variable declaration, while `const` is not. This means that `cb` would be redeclared on each iteration of the loop, while `const cb` would retain its value from the previous iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb = () => {};
```
This would result in different behavior because `() => {}` is a function expression, while `const cb` is a variable declaration. This means that `cb` would be assigned a function value, while `const cb` would retain its original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb = function() {};
```
This would result in different behavior because `function() {}` is a function declaration, while `const cb` is a variable declaration. This means that `cb` would be assigned a function value, while `const cb` would retain its original value.

DONE.
