  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `reduce` method to use a different initial value than the original `basis` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `reduce` method to throw an error when it attempts to access the `length` property of a non-existent array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `reduce` method to start iterating over the array at index 1 instead of 0.

DONE.
