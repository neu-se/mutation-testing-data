  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` is a method that retains the next operation in the iterator, whereas `push` is a method that pushes the next operation into the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a method that deletes the next operation in the iterator, whereas `push` is a method that pushes the next operation into the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.eachLine
```
This would result in different behavior because `eachLine` is a method that iterates over each line in the delta, whereas `push` is a method that pushes the next operation into the delta.

DONE.
