  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw "Invalid Param";
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw a different error message than the original code, which throws a `SyntaxError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['INFINITY'];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different value than the original code, which returns an object with `re` and `im` properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return { 're': NaN, 'im': NaN };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an object with `re` and `im` properties that are both `NaN`, whereas the original code returns an object with `re` and `im` properties that are both finite numbers.

DONE.
