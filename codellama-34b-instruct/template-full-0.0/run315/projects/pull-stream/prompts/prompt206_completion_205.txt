  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `aborted`, so if `aborted` is `true`, the new code fragment would evaluate to `false`, and if `aborted` is `false`, the new code fragment would evaluate to `true`. This would cause the `if` statement to behave differently than the original code fragment, which would only execute the code inside the `if` statement if `aborted` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator evaluates to `true` if both operands are `true`, and to `false` otherwise. In this case, if `aborted` is `true`, the new code fragment would evaluate to `true`, and if `aborted` is `false`, the new code fragment would evaluate to `false`. This would cause the `if` statement to behave differently than the original code fragment, which would only execute the code
