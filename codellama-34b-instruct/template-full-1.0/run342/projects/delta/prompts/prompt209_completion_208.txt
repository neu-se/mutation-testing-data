  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index += Op.length(nextOp) + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `++` operator is
incrementing the `index` variable by 1, whereas the original code was
incrementing it by the length of the `nextOp` operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index -= Op.length(nextOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-=` operator is
decrementing the `index` variable by the length of the `nextOp` operation,
whereas the original code was incrementing it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index = Math.max(0, index - Op.length(nextOp));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.max()` function is
ensuring that the `index` variable is never negative, whereas the original
code did not have this constraint.

DONE.
