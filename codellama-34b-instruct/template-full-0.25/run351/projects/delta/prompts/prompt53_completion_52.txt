  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `handler` is falsy, while this code checks if it is strictly equal to `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `handler` is falsy, while this code checks if it has a length of 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!handler.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `handler` is falsy, while this code checks if its length is falsy.

DONE.
