  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ retain: length }
```
This would result in different behavior because the operation is now retaining the length instead of deleting it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ insert: length }
```
This would result in different behavior because the operation is now inserting the length as a string instead of deleting it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ retain: length * 2 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the operation is now retaining twice the length instead of deleting only once.

DONE.
