  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `parts.pop()` would remove the last element from the `parts` array, instead of reducing it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `parts.shift()` would remove the first element from the `parts` array, instead of reducing it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `parts.reverse()` would reverse the order of the elements in the `parts` array, instead of reducing it.

DONE.
