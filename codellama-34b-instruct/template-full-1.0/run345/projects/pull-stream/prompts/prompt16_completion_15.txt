  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
99
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different value than the original code, which is not intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different value than the original code, which is not intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would attempt to access the `length` property of the `read` variable, which may not be defined.

DONE.
