  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
      typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' &&
      typeof lastOp.attributes === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because current code checks for any possible value for `typeof lastOp.attributes`, while replacing it with checking for an object value will only check if it's an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
      typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' &&
      lastOp.attributes.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because current code checks for any possible value for `typeof lastOp.attributes`, while replacing it with checking for a length greater than 0 will only check if it's not an empty array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
      typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' &&
      !isEqual(lastOp.attributes, {})
```
This would result in different behavior because current code checks for any possible value for `typeof lastOp.attributes`, while
