  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof arg !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `transformPosition` method to be executed when `arg` is a number, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `transformPosition` method to be executed when `arg` is a negative number, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg % 2 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `transformPosition` method to be executed when `arg` is an even number, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
