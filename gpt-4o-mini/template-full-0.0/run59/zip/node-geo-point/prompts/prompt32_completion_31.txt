Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the result of `deg2rad`, which would incorrectly increase the angle in radians, leading to inaccurate distance calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the result of `deg2rad` by 2, effectively doubling the angle in radians, which would also lead to incorrect distance calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(point1.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses the longitude of `point1` instead of `point2`, which would yield an incorrect calculation of the distance between the two points.

DONE.
