  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the truthiness of `map`, while this code fragment checks for nullity.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the truthiness of `map`, while this code fragment checks the length of the `map` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map[0] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the truthiness of `map`, while this code fragment checks the first element of the `map` array.

DONE.
