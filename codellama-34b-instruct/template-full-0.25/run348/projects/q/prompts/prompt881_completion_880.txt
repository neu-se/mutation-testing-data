  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `deferred.makeNodeResolver(<PLACEHOLDER>)` to create a node-style callback, which would have called `deferred.reject` with the error as the first argument. However, in this modified code, `deferred.reject` is called directly with the error as the only argument, which would result in a different error being thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `deferred.makeNodeResolver(<PLACEHOLDER>)` to create a node-style callback, which would have called `deferred.resolve` with the value as the first argument. However, in this modified code, `deferred.resolve` is called directly with the value as the only argument, which would result in a different value being returned.
