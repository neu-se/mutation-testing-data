  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.hasNext()
```
This code fragment is a function call that returns a boolean value indicating whether the iterator has a next element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.hasNext === true
```
This code fragment is a comparison that checks whether the `hasNext` property of the iterator is equal to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.hasNext !== false
```
This code fragment is a comparison that checks whether the `hasNext` property of the iterator is not equal to `false`.

DONE.
