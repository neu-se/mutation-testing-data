  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes != null &&
      typeof attributes !== 'object' &&
      Object.keys(attributes).length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `attributes` is not an object and also has a length greater than 0, which would always be `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes != null &&
      typeof attributes === 'object' &&
      Object.keys(attributes).length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `attributes` is an object and also has a length less than 0, which is always `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes != null &&
      typeof attributes === 'object' &&
      Object.keys(attributes).length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `attributes` is an object and also has a length of 0, which would be `true` if `attributes` is an empty
