 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly decrement the index when performing a delete or retain operation, potentially causing the iteration to skip or remove the wrong operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + length * 2
