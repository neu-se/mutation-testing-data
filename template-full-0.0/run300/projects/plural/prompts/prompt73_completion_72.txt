  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cello', 'cellos'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a rule for pluralizing the word "cello," but the new code fragment is a rule for pluralizing the word "cellos."

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cello', 'violoncellos'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a rule for pluralizing the word "cello," but the new code fragment is a rule for pluralizing the word "violoncello."

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cello', 'violins'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a rule for pluralizing the word "cello," but the new code fragment is a rule for pluralizing the word "violin."

DONE.
