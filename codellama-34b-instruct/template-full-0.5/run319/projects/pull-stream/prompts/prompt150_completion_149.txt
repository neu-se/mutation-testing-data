  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `abort` is truthy, while this new code fragment checks if `abort` is not equal to `null`. This change would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `abort` is truthy, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `abort` is truthy, while this new code fragment checks if `abort` is falsy. This change would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `abort` is falsy, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort.toString() === 'null'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `abort` is
