  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() !== 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, so it would return `true` if the peeked type is not `'delete'`, even if it is a different type altogether.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, so it would return `true` if the peeked type is `'insert'`, even if it is not the expected type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, so it would return `true` if the peeked type is `'retain'`, even if it is not the expected type.

DONE.
