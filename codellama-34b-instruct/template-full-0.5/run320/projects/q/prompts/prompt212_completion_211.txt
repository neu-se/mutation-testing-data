  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value === Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the value is the `Promise` constructor function itself, rather than an instance of the `Promise` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.constructor === Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the value's constructor function is the `Promise` constructor function, rather than checking if the value is an instance of the `Promise` class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.constructor.name === "Promise"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the value's constructor function's name is "Promise", rather than checking if the value is an instance of the `Promise` class.

DONE.
