Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` would create a new promise that is resolved with the given value, rather than calling the original `Q` function, which may have different handling for the promise resolution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` would immediately reject the promise with the given reason, instead of allowing the promise to resolve normally, which would lead to different outcomes in promise chaining.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all` expects an array of promises and resolves when all of them are fulfilled, which is different from the original behavior that simply calls `Q` without any specific expectation on the input structure.

DONE.
