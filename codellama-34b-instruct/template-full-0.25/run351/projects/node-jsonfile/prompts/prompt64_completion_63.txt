  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'ascii'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Buffer.toString()` method would use the ASCII encoding instead of UTF-8, which could lead to incorrect results if the input buffer contains non-ASCII characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'utf16le'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Buffer.toString()` method would use the UTF-16 little-endian encoding instead of UTF-8, which could lead to incorrect results if the input buffer contains non-ASCII characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'base64'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Buffer.toString()` method would use the base64 encoding instead of UTF-8, which could lead to incorrect results if the input buffer contains non-ASCII characters.

DONE.
