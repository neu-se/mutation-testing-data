  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for null or undefined, while this replacement only checks for null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert != undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for null or undefined, while this replacement only checks for undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert != 'null'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for null or undefined, while this replacement only checks for the string 'null'.

DONE.
