  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextStream` is a function that reads the next stream from the stream of streams, whereas `nextChunk` is a function that reads the next chunk from the current stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function and would cause an error when called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function and would cause an error when called.

DONE.
