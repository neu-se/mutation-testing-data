  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gettype` function expects a URL object as its first argument, and passing `null` would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.baseurl
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gettype` function expects a URL object as its first argument, and passing a string (the `baseurl` property of the `currentUrl` object) would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gettype` function expects a URL object as its second argument, and passing a string (the `baseUrl` variable) would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

DONE.
