  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key, val) === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `===` operator, which checks for strict equality, while the new code fragment uses the `==` operator, which checks for loose equality. This could cause the `forEach` method to behave differently when iterating over the keys and values in the database.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key, val) !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `===` operator, which checks for strict equality, while the new code fragment uses the `!==` operator, which checks for strict inequality. This could cause the `forEach` method to behave differently when iterating over the keys and values in the database.
