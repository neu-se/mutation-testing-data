  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_values
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_values` returns an array of a given object's values, whereas `object_keys` returns an array of a given object's keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_entries` returns an array of a given object's entries, whereas `object_keys` returns an array of a given object's keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.getOwnPropertyNames(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.getOwnPropertyNames()` returns an array of a given object's own property names, whereas `object_keys` returns an array of a given object's keys.

DONE.
