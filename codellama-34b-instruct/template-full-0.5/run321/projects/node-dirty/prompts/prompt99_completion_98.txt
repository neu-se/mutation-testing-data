  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Could not load corrupted row: ${rowStr}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, which could cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Corrupted row: ${rowStr}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, which could cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Could not load row: ${rowStr}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, which could cause the test to fail.

DONE.
