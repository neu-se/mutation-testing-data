  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(parsedBaseUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.parse` returns a URL object rather than a string, and the code that uses the result of `URL.format` assumes that it is dealing with a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl.href
```
This would result in different behavior because `parsedBaseUrl.href` refers to the original URL string that was parsed, whereas the original code uses the result of `URL.parse` which is a URL object that contains more information than just the URL string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the code that uses the result of `URL.format` would receive `null` instead of a URL object, which would cause the function to throw an error.

DONE.
