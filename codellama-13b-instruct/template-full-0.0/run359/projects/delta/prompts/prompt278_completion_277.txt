  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thisOp.insert` property is not defined, and the code would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the `otherOp.insert` property is not defined, and the code would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thisOp.retain` property is not defined, and the code would throw an error.

DONE.
