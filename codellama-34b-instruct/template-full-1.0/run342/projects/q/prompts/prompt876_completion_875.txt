  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would be called with `undefined` as the `this` value, which would likely cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.slice.apply(array_slice)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new `slice` method on the `array_slice` function, which would not exist on the original object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a random number as the `slice` argument to the `array_slice` function, which would produce unexpected results.

DONE.
