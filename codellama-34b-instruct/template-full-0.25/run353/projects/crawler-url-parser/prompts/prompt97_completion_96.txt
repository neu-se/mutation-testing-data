  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl || currentUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true` if `currentUrl` is truthy, regardless of whether `currentUrl.url` is also truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl && !currentUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false` if `currentUrl` is truthy and `currentUrl.url` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url || currentUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true` if `currentUrl.url` is truthy, regardless of whether `currentUrl` is also truthy.

DONE.
