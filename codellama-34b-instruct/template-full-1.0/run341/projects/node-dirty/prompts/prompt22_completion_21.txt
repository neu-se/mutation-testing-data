  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { if (cb) cb(); this.emit('drain'); }
```
This would result in the callback being called twice, which would cause the test suite to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would cause the callback to never be called, which would also cause the test suite to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { cb(); }
```
This would cause the callback to be called immediately, which would also cause the test suite to fail.

DONE.
