  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("get", [])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the "get" method on the object with an empty array as the argument, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("set", [])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the "set" method on the object with an empty array as the argument, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("delete", [])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the "delete" method on the object with an empty array as the argument, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
