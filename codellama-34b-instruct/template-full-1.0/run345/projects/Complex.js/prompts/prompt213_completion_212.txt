  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be negating the imaginary part of the complex number, whereas the original code fragment does not negate any part of the number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be adding the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, whereas the original code fragment only adds the real part to itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a^2 + b^2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be taking the square root of the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, whereas the original code fragment only takes the square root of the real part.

DONE.
