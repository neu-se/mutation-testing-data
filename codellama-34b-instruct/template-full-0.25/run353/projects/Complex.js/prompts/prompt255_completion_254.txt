  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add `a` and `b` instead of multiplying them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b * c
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply `a`, `b`, and `c` instead of just `a` and `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would divide `a` by `b` instead of multiplying them.

DONE.
