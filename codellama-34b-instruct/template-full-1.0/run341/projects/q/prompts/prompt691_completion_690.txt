  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [this, array_slice(arguments)]
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the promise prototype instead of `void 0`, which could cause the promise to be resolved with an unexpected value or to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call", [void 0, array_slice(arguments)]
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` expects a function as its first argument, but `void 0` is not a function, which could cause the promise to be resolved with an unexpected value or to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"all", [array_slice(arguments)]
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` expects an array of promises as its first argument, but `array_slice(arguments)` returns an array containing the arguments passed to the function, which could not be promises.

DONE.
