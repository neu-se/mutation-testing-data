  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data` is a Map object, and `this.get(key)` is a method that retrieves a value from the database, but `this._data.get(key)` retrieves a value from the in-memory cache.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(key) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different value than the original code, which would return the actual value stored in the database.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a random number instead of the actual value stored in the database.

DONE.
