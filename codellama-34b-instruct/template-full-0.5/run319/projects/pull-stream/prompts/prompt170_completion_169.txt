  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` calls the callback function with a `null` error and the value `array[i++]`, while this new code fragment calls the callback function with a `false` error and no value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i++] + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` calls the callback function with a `null` error and the value `array[i++]`, while this new code fragment calls the callback function with a `null` error and the value `array[i++] + 1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` calls the callback function with a `null` error and the value `array[i++]`, while this new code fragment calls the callback function with a
