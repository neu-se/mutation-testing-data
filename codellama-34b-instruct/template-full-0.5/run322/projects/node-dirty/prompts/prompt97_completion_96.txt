  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit(null, 'error', new Error(`Could not load corrupted row: ${rowStr}`));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits an error event with the `this` keyword as the first argument, while the replaced code emits an error event with `null` as the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error(`Could not load corrupted row: ${rowStr}`));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits an error event with the `this` keyword as the first argument, while the replaced code emits an error event with a new Error object as the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error(`Could not load corrupted row: ${rowStr}`), this);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits an error event with the `this` keyword as the first argument
