  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_create(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_create` is a function that creates a new object with the specified prototype, whereas `object_create(null)` creates a new object with a null prototype, which can cause issues with the code that uses the object.
