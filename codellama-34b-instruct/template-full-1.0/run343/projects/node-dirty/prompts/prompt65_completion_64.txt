  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this._writeStream.pipe()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pipe()` is a method that streams data from a source to a destination, whereas `destroy()` is a method that cleans up and ends the stream. Using `pipe()` in this context would cause the stream to continue writing data to the file, even after the `close()` method has been called, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this._writeStream.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because `end()` is a method that signals the end of the stream, whereas `destroy()` is a method that cleans up and ends the stream. Using `end()` in this context would cause the stream to end without cleaning up, leading to resource leaks and potential data loss.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this._writeStream.destroy(new Error('Intentional failure'))
```
This would result in different behavior because `destroy
