Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error('File not found')
```
This would result in different behavior because it always emits a new error with a fixed message instead of the actual error encountered, potentially obscuring the real issue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', err
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits a 'load' event with the error object instead of an 'error' event, which could lead to confusion in event handling as the error would not be properly reported.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', null
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits an 'error' event with a null value, which is not a valid error object and could lead to unhandled exceptions or incorrect error handling in the event listeners.

DONE.
