  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it omits the first argument to the `array_slice` function, which is the array to be sliced. This could cause the function to return an incorrect result, which would be a bug.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it omits the first two arguments to the `array_slice` function, which are the array to be sliced and the index at which to start the slice. This could cause the function to return an incorrect result, which would be a bug.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 3)]
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it omits the first three arguments
