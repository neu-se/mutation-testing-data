  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return `undefined` instead of `Q`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would assign `var undefined` to `arguments` instead of keeping it unchanged.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return `null` instead of `Q`.

DONE.
