  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `true` would always return a truthy value, while the new code fragment `false` would always return a falsy value, which could break the functionality of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `true` would always return a truthy value, while the new code fragment `0` would always return a falsy value, which could break the functionality of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `true` would always return a truthy value, while the new code fragment `""` would always return a falsy value, which could break the functionality of the program.

DONE.
