  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(ops.ops)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `ops.ops` is an array, which is not the same as checking if `ops` is an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray(ops.ops)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `ops.ops` is not an array, which is the opposite of checking if `ops` is an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.ops.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `ops.ops` has a length of 0, which is not the same as checking if `ops` is an array.

DONE.
