  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/_: (\w+)(?= \()/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only match file names that start with a word character and have an opening parenthesis after the file name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(at )?.+?(\w+):(\d+):(\d+)(?= )/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match the file path, file name, and line number separately, and also match the line number with multiple digits.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\w+):(\d+)(?:.js:(\d+))/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match the file name and line number separately, and also match the line number with multiple digits.

DONE.
