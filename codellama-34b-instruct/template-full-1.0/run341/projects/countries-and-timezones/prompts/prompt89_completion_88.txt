  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deprecated` property would always be set to `true` for all timezones, regardless of whether they are deprecated or not. This would cause the `deliverTimezones` function to always return an empty object, even if the input `tzs` object contains non-deprecated timezones.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = !options.deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deprecated` property would be negated, which would cause the `deliverTimezones` function to always return the opposite value of what it should return. If the `options.deprecated` property is `true`, the function would return an empty object, and if it is `false`, the function would return all the timezones.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = options.de
