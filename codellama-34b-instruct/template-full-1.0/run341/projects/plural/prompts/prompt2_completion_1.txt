  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because 0 will be a falsy value and break the logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because 1 will be truthy value and skip the logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because -1 is an unexpected value and will throw an error.

DONE.
