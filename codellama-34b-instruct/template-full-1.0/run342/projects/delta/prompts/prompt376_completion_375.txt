  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset < index
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the op is an insert or not, while this option only checks if the offset is less than the index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() >= index
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the op is an insert or not, while this option only checks the length of the op.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index % 2 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the op is an insert or not, while this option only checks if the index is even or not.

DONE.
