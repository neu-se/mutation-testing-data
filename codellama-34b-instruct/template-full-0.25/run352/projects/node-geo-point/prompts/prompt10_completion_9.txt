  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty.call(point, 'coordinates')
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasOwnProperty` is a method that checks if an object has a property with the given name, but it needs to be called with the object as its context. In this case, we are calling `hasOwnProperty` with `point` as its context, which will return `true` if `point` has a property called `'coordinates'`, and `false` otherwise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length === 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `coordinates` property of `point` is an array with a length of 2, which is not the same as checking if `point` has a property called `'coordinates'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates') && point.coordinates.length === 2
```
