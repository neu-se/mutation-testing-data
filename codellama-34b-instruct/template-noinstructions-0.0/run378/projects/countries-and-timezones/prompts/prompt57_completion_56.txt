  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is negating the expression, so the `memoizeCountry` function would be called even if the country is already memoized.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, so the `memoizeCountry` function would only be called if the country is not already memoized.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, so the `memoizeCountry` function would only be called if the country is already memoized.

DONE.
