  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setImmediate(deferred.reject, new Error("test error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected immediately, without waiting for the Node function to be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the value `undefined`, instead of a promise for the resolution of the given promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver("test")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the value "test", instead of a promise for the resolution of the given promise.

DONE.
