  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).done
```
This would result in different behavior because `fail` is a method that handles rejection, while `done` is a method that handles resolution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `fail` is a method that handles rejection, while `catch` is a method that handles rejection and returns a promise that is resolved with the result of the callback function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).finally
```
This would result in different behavior because `finally` is a method that handles both resolution and rejection, but does not return a promise that is resolved with the result of the callback function.

DONE.
