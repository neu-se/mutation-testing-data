Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("apply", [null, args]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `null` instead of `void 0`, which may lead to different handling of the `this` context in the dispatched function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("apply", [undefined, args]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly uses `undefined` instead of `void 0`, which could potentially lead to differences in how the JavaScript engine interprets the value, although in most cases they are equivalent.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("apply", [this, args]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes `this` as the first argument instead of `void 0`, which changes the context in which the function is executed, potentially affecting the behavior of the function being called.

DONE.
