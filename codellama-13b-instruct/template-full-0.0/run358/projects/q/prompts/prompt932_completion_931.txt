  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value for a function argument, whereas `void 0` is not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a valid value for a function argument, whereas `void 0` is not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a valid value for a function argument, whereas `void 0` is not.

DONE.
