  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] - this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `im` property is the imaginary part of the complex number, and it is not being used in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] + this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator is being used instead of the `-` operator, which would result in a different value being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] * this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator is being used instead of the `-` operator, which would result in a different value being returned.

DONE.
