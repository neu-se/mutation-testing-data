  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!callback || typeof callback.call !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is replaced with `call`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!callback || typeof callback.bind !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is replaced with `bind`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback !== undefined && typeof callback.apply !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!callback` segment is removed and the `typeof` check is surrounded by parentheses.

DONE.
