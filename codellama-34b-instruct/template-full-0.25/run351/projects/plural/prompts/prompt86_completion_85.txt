  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('person', 'peoples')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a new rule to the list of rules, but this code fragment would attempt to add a rule with a duplicate key, which would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('person', 'peopl')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a new rule to the list of rules, but this code fragment would add a rule with a different value, which would cause the pluralization of "person" to be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('person', function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a new rule to the list of rules, but this code fragment would add a rule with a different function, which would cause the pluralization of "person" to be different.

DONE.
