  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, this._data.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `forEach` method to iterate over the key-value pairs in the `_data` map, rather than just the keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, val
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `forEach` method to iterate over the key-value pairs in the `_data` map, rather than just the keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, this._data.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `forEach` method to iterate over the key-value pairs in the `_data` map, rather than just the keys.

DONE.
