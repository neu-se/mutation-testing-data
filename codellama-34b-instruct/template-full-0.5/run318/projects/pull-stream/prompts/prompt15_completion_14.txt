  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `args === undefined` would always evaluate to `false` if `args` is a non-empty array, while `args == null` would evaluate to `true` if `args` is a non-empty array. This change would cause the function to throw an error if `args` is a non-empty array, which is not the intended behavior of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.length === 0` would evaluate to `true` if `args` is an empty array, while `args == null` would evaluate to `false` if `args` is an empty array. This change would cause the function to throw an error if `args` is an empty array, which is not the intended behavior of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof args === 'undefined'
```
This would result
