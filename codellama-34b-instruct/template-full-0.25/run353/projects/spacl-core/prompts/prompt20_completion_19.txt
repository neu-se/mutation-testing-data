  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `string.includes` checks if a string contains a certain substring, while `string.endsWith` checks if a string ends with a certain substring.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `string.startsWith` checks if a string starts with a certain substring, while `string.endsWith` checks if a string ends with a certain substring.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `string.indexOf` returns the index of the first occurrence of a substring in a string, while `string.endsWith` checks if a string ends with a certain substring.

DONE.
