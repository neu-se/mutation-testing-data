  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListeners[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always call the first progress listener, while the original code calls all the progress listeners in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListeners.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the length of the progress listeners array, while the original code calls all the progress listeners in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListeners.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always call the last progress listener, while the original code calls all the progress listeners in the array.

DONE.
