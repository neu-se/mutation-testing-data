  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.del` method is intended to act on objects, and passing an empty string as the object would result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.del` method is intended to act on objects, and passing the number 42 as the object would result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.del` method is intended to act on objects, and passing `undefined` as the object would result in an error.

DONE.
