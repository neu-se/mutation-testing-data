  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{
  return {
    [embedType]: handler.transform(
      thisData[embedType],
      otherData[embedType],
      !priority,
    ),
  };
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `priority` parameter is negated, which would cause the transformation to be performed in the opposite order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{
  return {
    [embedType]: handler.transform(
      otherData[embedType],
      thisData[embedType],
      priority,
    ),
  };
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thisData` and `otherData` parameters are swapped, which would cause the transformation to be performed with the arguments in the opposite order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{
  return {
    [embedType]: handler.transform(
      thisData[embedType],
      otherData[embed
