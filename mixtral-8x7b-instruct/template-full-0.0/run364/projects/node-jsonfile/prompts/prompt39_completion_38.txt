 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fs.writeFile
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the locally scoped `_fs` variable instead of the `fs` module passed in through the `options` parameter. This could cause issues if the user has specified a different `fs` implementation in the `options`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the synchronous version of the `writeFile` function, which could block the event loop and cause performance issues.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.appendFile
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends the data to the file instead of overwriting it. This could cause unexpected behavior if the user expects the file to be overwritten.

DONE.
