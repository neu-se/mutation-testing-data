  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true`, even if `tokens` is not `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only evaluate to `true` if `tokens` is an empty array, whereas the original code fragment would evaluate to `true` for any falsy value of `tokens`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!tokens
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate to `true` for any falsy value of `tokens`, whereas the original code fragment would only evaluate to `true` if `tokens` is `null`.

DONE.
