  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is called instead of `fulfill`, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfill(otherValue)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill` is called with a different value than the original code fragment, which would cause the promise to be resolved to a different value than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfill(value + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill` is called with a value that is different from the original code fragment, which would cause the promise to be resolved to a different value than expected.

DONE.
