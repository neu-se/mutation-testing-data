  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort(abort, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `onAbort` function with the `abort` and `cb` arguments, whereas the original code fragment only passed the `abort` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort(abort, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `onAbort` function with the `abort` and `cb` arguments, whereas the original code fragment only passed the `abort` argument.
