  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb2
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb2` is not defined, which would cause an error in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.cb
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.cb` would refer to a different variable than `cb`, which could potentially cause unexpected behavior if `this.cb` is not defined or has a different value than `cb`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.size
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbs.size` would refer to the size of the `cbs` array, which may be different from the size of the `cbs` array at the time the callback was registered.

DONE.
