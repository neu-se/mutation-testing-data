  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because `parsedUrl` is the parsed URL object, while `parsedBaseUrl` is the parsed base URL object. Using `parsedUrl` would result in the base URL being set to the current URL, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl.href
```
This would result in different behavior because `parsedBaseUrl.href` is the href attribute of the parsed base URL object, while `parsedUrl` is the parsed URL object. Using `parsedBaseUrl.href` would result in the base URL being set to the current URL, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseUrl` is the base URL object, while `parsedUrl` is the parsed URL object. Using `baseUrl` would result in the base URL being set to the current URL
