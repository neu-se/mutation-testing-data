  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve` is used to create a resolved promise, while `Promise.reject` is used to create a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid return value for a function, while `Promise.reject` is not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a valid return value for a function, while `Promise.reject` is not.

DONE.
