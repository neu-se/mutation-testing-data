  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deprecated !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the opposite of the original code, which would return the timezones that are not deprecated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also return the opposite of the original code, which would return the timezones that are not deprecated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the deprecated timezones, which is the opposite of the original code that returns the non-deprecated timezones.

DONE.
