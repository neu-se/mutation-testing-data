  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` will immediately reject the promise, whereas `callback` will call the callback function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve()` will immediately resolve the promise, whereas `callback` will call the callback function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.notify()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.notify()` will send a notification to the promise, whereas `callback` will call the callback function.

DONE.
