  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis|abstract|summary/i
```
This would result in different behavior because a new word "abstract" is included in the list of words that follow the same pattern as "thesis" and "crisis", but the original code fragment does not include it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis|multiplicity/i
```
This would result in different behavior because a new word "multiplicity" is included in the list of words that follow the same pattern as "thesis" and "crisis", but the original code fragment does not include it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis|none/i
```
This would result in different behavior because a new word "none" is included in the list of words that follow the same pattern as "thesis" and "crisis", but the original code fragment does not include it.

DONE.
