  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rules.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `rules.pop` would remove the last rule from the array, instead of adding a new rule to the beginning of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rules.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `rules.shift` would remove the first rule from the array, instead of adding a new rule to the beginning of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rules.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `rules.push` would add a new rule to the end of the array, instead of adding a new rule to the beginning of the array.

DONE.
