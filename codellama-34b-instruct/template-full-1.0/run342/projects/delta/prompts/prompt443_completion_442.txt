  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.offset` is a different value than `length`, and it would change the behavior of the `substr` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different substring than the original code, which would affect the rest of the method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different substring than the original code, which would affect the rest of the method.

DONE.
