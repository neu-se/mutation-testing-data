  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(ops.ops)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `ops` property of `ops` is an array, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(ops)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `ops` is an array, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.ops.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `ops` property of `ops` has a length greater than 0, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

DONE.
