  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
7
```
This would result in different behavior because the `type` function would return "Array" instead of "RegExp", which would cause the `addRule` function to add the rule to the wrong array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return the wrong substring, which would cause the `addRule` function to add the rule to the wrong array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
9
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return an empty string, which would cause the `addRule` function to add the rule to the wrong array.

DONE.
