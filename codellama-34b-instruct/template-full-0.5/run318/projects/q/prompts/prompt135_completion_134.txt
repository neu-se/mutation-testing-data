  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_hasOwnProperty` is a function that checks if an object has a specific property, whereas `object_toString` is a function that returns a string representation of an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_reduce
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_reduce` is a function that applies a function to each element of an array, whereas `object_toString` is a function that returns a string representation of an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isObject
```
This would result in different behavior because `isObject` is a function that checks if a value is an object, whereas `object_toString` is a function that returns a string representation of an object.

DONE.
