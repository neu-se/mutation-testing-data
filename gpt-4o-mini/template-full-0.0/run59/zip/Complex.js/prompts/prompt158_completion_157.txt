Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `z` is infinite instead of checking if `z` is zero, which would lead to a different outcome when dividing by a complex number that is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the current instance (`this`) is zero instead of checking if `z` is zero, which could lead to incorrect results when dividing by a non-zero complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the real part of `z` is zero instead of checking if `z` is zero as a whole, which could incorrectly allow division by a complex number that has a non-zero imaginary part.

DONE.
