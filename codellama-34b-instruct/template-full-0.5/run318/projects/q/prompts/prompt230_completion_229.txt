  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op === "when" && operands[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `operands[2]` would be evaluated to `true` instead of `operands[1]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op === "when" && !operands[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!operands[1]` would be evaluated to `true` instead of `operands[1]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op === "when" && operands[1] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `operands[1] === undefined` would be evaluated to `true` instead of `operands[1]`.

DONE.
