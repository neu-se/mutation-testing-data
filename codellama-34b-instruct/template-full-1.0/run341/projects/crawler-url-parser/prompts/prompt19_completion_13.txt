  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr['replace']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` variable is not a string, but an object with a `replace` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr['replace'] = function() { return 'foo'; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` function would always return the string `'foo'`, causing the parsing of the URL to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr['replace'] = function() { throw new Error('foo'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` function would throw an error with the message `'foo'`, causing the parsing of the URL to fail.

DONE.
