  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isNaN` function to check the real part of the complex number instead of the imaginary part, which could lead to incorrect results in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isNaN` function to check the imaginary part of the complex number plus one, which could lead to incorrect results in some cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isNaN` function to check the imaginary part of the complex number multiplied by two, which could lead to incorrect results in some cases.

DONE.
