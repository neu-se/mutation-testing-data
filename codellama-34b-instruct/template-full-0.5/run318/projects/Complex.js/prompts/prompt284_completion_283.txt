  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` refers to the `re` property of the `Complex` object, while the replacement code fragment `b` refers to the `im` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is used as-is, while the replacement code fragment `a + 1` adds 1 to the value of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is used as-is, while the replacement code fragment `Math.PI` is a constant representing the mathematical constant pi.

DONE.
