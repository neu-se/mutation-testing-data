  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would change the value of `nearerValue`, potentially causing the `isPromise` function to return `false` when it should return `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operator would change the value of `nearerValue`, potentially causing the `isPromise` function to return `true` when it should return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator would change the value of `nearerValue`, potentially causing the `isPromise` function to return `false` when it should return `true`.

DONE.
