```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` function is different from the `callback` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` function is different from the `callback` function. The `error` function is used to handle errors in a promise chain, while the `callback` function is a function that is called when a
