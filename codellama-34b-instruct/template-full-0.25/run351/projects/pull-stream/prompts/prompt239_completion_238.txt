  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `cb` function if the `end` argument is falsy, but the new code fragment calls the `cb` function regardless of the value of `end`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `data` argument to the `cb` function as is, but the new code fragment passes the `data` argument plus 1 to the `cb` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data.toString())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `data` argument to the `cb` function as is, but the new code fragment passes the string representation of the `data` argument to the `cb` function.

DONE.
