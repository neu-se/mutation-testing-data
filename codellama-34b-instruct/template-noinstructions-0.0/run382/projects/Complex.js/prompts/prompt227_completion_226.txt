  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a complex number, while `a + 1` is a real number. The `pow` function is designed to work with complex numbers, so using a real number as the base could result in unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a complex number, while `a - 1` is a real number. The `pow` function is designed to work with complex numbers, so using a real number as the base could result in unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a complex number, while `a * 2` is a real number. The `pow` function is designed to work with complex numbers, so using a real number as the base could result
