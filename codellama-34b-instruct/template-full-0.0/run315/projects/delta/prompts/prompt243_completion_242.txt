  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain = otherOp.retain;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the value of `otherOp.retain` to `thisOp.retain`, which would change the behavior of the `retain` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain = otherOp.delete;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the value of `otherOp.delete` to `thisOp.retain`, which would change the behavior of the `retain` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain = otherOp.retain + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `otherOp.retain` and assign it to `thisOp.retain`, which would change the behavior of the `retain` method.

DONE.
