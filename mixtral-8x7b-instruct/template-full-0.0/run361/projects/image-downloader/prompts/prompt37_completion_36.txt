 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(dest, { flags: 'a' }) => createWriteStream(dest, { flags: 'a' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends the data to the file instead of overwriting it. The original code fragment creates a new file if dest does not exist, while this modification would create the file if it doesn't exist and append to it if it does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(dest, { encoding: 'base64' }) => createWriteStream(dest, { encoding: 'base64' })
