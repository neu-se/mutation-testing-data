  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"name"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a variable, while the replacement code fragment is a string literal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name + "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a variable, while the replacement code fragment is a string concatenation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a variable, while the replacement code fragment is a method call.

DONE.
