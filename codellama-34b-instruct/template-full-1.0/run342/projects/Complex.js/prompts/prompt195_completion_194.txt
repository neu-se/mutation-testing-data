  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(b, z['re']) * Complex['NAN']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `NaN` instead of the correct value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(b, z['re']) * Complex['INFINITY']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `Infinity` instead of the correct value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(b, z['re']) * Complex['ONE']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return 1 instead of the correct value.

DONE.
