  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).thenResolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `thenResolve` is a method that resolves a promise with a given value, whereas `thenReject` is a method that rejects a promise with a given reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).thenReject(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because `thenReject` is a method that rejects a promise with a given reason, whereas `thenResolve` is a method that resolves a promise with a given value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).thenReject(reason).thenResolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `thenReject` is a method that rejects a promise with a given reason, and `thenResolve` is a method that resolves a promise with a given value. By chaining these two methods together, the promise would first be rejected and then resolved
