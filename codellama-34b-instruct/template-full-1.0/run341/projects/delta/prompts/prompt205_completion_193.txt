  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof otherOp.delete === 'number' &&
          (typeof thisOp.retain === 'object' ||
            (typeof thisOp.retain === 'number' && thisOp.retain !== null))
```
This would result in different behavior because the second part of the condition is checking if `thisOp.retain` is an object or a number, which is the opposite of the original code. If `thisOp.retain` is an object, the code will return `true` even if `otherOp.delete` is not a number, whereas the original code would have returned `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof otherOp.delete === 'number' &&
          (typeof thisOp.retain === 'object' ||
            (typeof thisOp.retain === 'number' && thisOp.retain === null))
```
This would result in different behavior because the second part of the condition is checking if `thisOp.retain` is an object or `null`, which is
