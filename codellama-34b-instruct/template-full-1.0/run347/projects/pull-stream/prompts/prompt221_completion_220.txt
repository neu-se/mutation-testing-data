  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a call to the `data` function, which is not replaced by `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a call to the `data` function, which is not replaced by `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(!data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a call to the `data` function, which is not replaced by a call to the `data` function with a negated argument.

DONE.
