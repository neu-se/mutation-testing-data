  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = !promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `!` is the logical NOT operator, which would invert the truthiness of the variable `promise`, potentially causing the loop to run an extra time or stop prematurely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, which would cause the loop to exit immediately, potentially resulting in errors if the loop is not supposed to exit at that point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = "Hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because `p` would change to the string "Hello", potentially causing the loop to compare the string to `promise` incorrectly and produce unexpected results.

DONE.
