  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key)
```
This code fragment is a direct replacement for the original code fragment, and it has the same behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key + 1)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code fragment, but it adds 1 to the key before retrieving the value from the data object. This change will cause the code to behave differently, as it will retrieve the value for the next key in the data object, rather than the current key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key - 1)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code fragment, but it subtracts 1 from the key before retrieving the value from the data object. This change will cause the code to behave differently, as it will retrieve the value for the previous key in the data object, rather than the current key.

DONE.
