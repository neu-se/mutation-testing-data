  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would no longer be accessible, leading to a `TypeError` when the `post` method is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch = function() { return; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would no longer have any effect, as it would return `undefined` without taking any action.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch = function() { throw new Error("Something went wrong!"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would now throw an error when called, causing the promise to be rejected with the error message "Something went wrong!"

DONE.
