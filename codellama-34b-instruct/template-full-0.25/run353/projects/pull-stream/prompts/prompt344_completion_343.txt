  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort()
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort` is a function, and calling it would execute the function, whereas the original code fragment only evaluates to the function itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort && onAbort()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than the `?:` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(onAbort && onAbort()) ? null : abort`, which is different from the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort || onAbort()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has a higher precedence than the `?:` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(onAbort || onAbort()) ? null : abort`, which is different from the original code fragment.

DONE.
