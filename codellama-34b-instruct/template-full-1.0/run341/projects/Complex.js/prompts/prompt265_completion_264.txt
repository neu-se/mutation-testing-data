  DONE.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` is the imaginary part of the complex number, whereas `a` is the real part. This change would cause the `log` method to return the wrong value for the imaginary part of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the imaginary part of the complex number would be computed as `a + b`, which is not correct. This change would cause the `log` method to return the wrong value for the imaginary part of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the imaginary part of the complex number would be computed as `a - b`, which is not correct. This change would cause the `log` method to return the wrong value for the imaginary part of the complex number.

DONE.
