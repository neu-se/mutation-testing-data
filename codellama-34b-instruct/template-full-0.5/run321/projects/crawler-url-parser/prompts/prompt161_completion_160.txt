  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_without_last_part === pageurl_without_last_part
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `==` operator, which checks for equality after type coercion, while the replacement code fragment uses the `===` operator, which checks for equality without type coercion. This means that the replacement code fragment may produce a different result if the types of the two operands are different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_without_last_part !== pageurl_without_last_part
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `==` operator, which checks for equality after type coercion, while the replacement code fragment uses the `!==` operator, which checks for inequality without type coercion. This means that the replacement code fragment may produce a different result if the types of the two operands are different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_without
