Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly treat a real number of zero as a complex number, leading to an incorrect string representation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the imaginary part instead of the real part, potentially altering the output for complex numbers that are purely real.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(a) > Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the real part significant if it is greater than a small threshold, potentially misrepresenting very small real numbers as zero.

DONE.
