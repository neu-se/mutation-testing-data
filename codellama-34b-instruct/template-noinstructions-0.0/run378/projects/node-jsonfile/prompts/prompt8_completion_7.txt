  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data = data.replace(/^\ufeff/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `stripBom` function to remove the BOM (Byte Order Mark) from the data, while this replacement code uses a regular expression to remove the BOM. The regular expression may not match the BOM in all cases, leading to different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data = data.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `stripBom` function to remove the BOM (Byte Order Mark) from the data, while this replacement code removes the first character of the data. The first character may not be the BOM in all cases, leading to different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data = data.replace(/^(\ufeff)?/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `stripBom` function to remove the BOM (
