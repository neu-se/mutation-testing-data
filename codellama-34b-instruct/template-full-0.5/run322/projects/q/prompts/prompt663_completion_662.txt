  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument passed to `array_slice` is now 2 instead of 1, which would cause the function to return a different array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 0)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument passed to `array_slice` is now 0 instead of 1, which would cause the function to return a different array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, -1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument passed to `array_slice` is now -1 instead of 1, which would cause the function to return a different array.

DONE.
