  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `options.url` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if it is `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!options.url.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `options.url` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if its length is 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url.indexOf('http') === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `options.url` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if it does not contain the string 'http'.

DONE.
