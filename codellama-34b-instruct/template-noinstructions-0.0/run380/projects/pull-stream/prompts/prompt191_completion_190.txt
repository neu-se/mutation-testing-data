  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.bind(null)` returns a new function that always returns `null`, whereas `prop` returns a function that returns the value of the `prop` property of its first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.bind(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.bind(undefined)` returns a new function that always returns `undefined`, whereas `prop` returns a function that returns the value of the `prop` property of its first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.bind(this)` returns a new function that always returns the value of the `prop` property of the current object, whereas `prop` returns a function that returns the value of the `prop` property of its first argument.

DONE.
