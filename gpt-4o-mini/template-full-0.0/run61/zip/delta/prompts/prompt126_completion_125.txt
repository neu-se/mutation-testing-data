Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index >= start
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the loop to continue when `index` is equal to `start`, potentially processing more operations than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the loop's termination condition, allowing it to run until `index` is less than `end`, which could lead to accessing operations beyond the intended range.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index === start
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only execute the loop body when `index` is exactly equal to `start`, which could skip processing operations if `index` is not equal to `start` at the beginning of the loop.

DONE.
