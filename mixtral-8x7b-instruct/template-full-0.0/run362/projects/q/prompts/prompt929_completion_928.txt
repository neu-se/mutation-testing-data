 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.constructor
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.constructor` may not refer to the `Q` object, and the `denodeify` method is expected to be a part of the `Q` prototype.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method expects a context (`this`) to be passed, and `null` would cause issues with method binding.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.then.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a specified context, but it does not execute the function. The `apply` method expects a function to be called with a given context and arguments.

DONE.
