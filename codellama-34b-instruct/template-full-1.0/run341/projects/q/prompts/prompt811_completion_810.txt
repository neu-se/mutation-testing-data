  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `callback` is a function that is called with the promise's resolution as its argument, whereas `null` would not be callable and would result in a different error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `callback` is a function that is called with the promise's resolution as its argument, whereas `false` is a non-callable value that would result in a different error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `callback` is a function that is called with the promise's resolution as its argument, whereas `0` is a non-callable value that would result in a different error.

DONE.
