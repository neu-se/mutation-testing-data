  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that is not an object, and therefore does not have a `then` method. This would cause the promise to be rejected with a `TypeError` instead of being resolved with the value of `value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that is not an object, and therefore does not have a `then` method. This would cause the promise to be rejected with a `TypeError` instead of being resolved with the value of `value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an object that does not have a `then` method. This would cause the promise to be rejected with a `TypeError` instead of being resolved with the value of `value`.

DONE.
