  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, data
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a distinct value from `null`, and it would cause the `cb` function to be called with a different set of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cb` function to be called with two `null` arguments, which would be different from the original code where it was called with `null` and `data`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cb` function to be called with two `undefined` arguments, which would be different from the original code where it was called with `null` and `data`.

DONE.
