  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"throw"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses "next" to indicate that the generator should continue iterating, while "throw" would cause the generator to stop iterating and throw an exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"yield"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses "next" to indicate that the generator should continue iterating, while "yield" would cause the generator to pause iteration and return a promise for the value of the yield expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"return"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses "next" to indicate that the generator should continue iterating, while "return" would cause the generator to stop iterating and return a promise for the return value of the generator function.

DONE.
