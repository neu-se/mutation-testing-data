  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` creates a shallow copy of the array, which means that the new array would contain the same elements as the original array, but any changes made to the new array would not affect the original array. In contrast, `this.rules` returns a reference to the original array, so any changes made to the new array would also affect the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat()` creates a new array that contains the elements of the original array, but any changes made to the new array would not affect the original array. In contrast, `this.rules` returns a reference to the original array, so any changes made to the new array would also affect the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.filter(rule => rule.query(path, verb, ctx) === true)
```
