  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.promiseDispatch.apply(newPromise, message);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise dispatch function to be called with the wrong `this` value, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.promiseDispatch.call(newPromise, message);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise dispatch function to be called with the correct `this` value, but it would not pass the `message` argument as an array of arguments, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.promiseDispatch.apply(newPromise, message.slice(1));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise dispatch function to be called with the correct `this` value and the `message` argument as an array of arguments, but it would skip the first element of the `
