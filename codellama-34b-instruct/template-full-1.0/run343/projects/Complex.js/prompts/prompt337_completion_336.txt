  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if a is zero, but if b is zero instead, it would return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if a is zero, but if a and b are added together and then checked if they are zero, it would return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a * a + b * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if a is zero, but if the square root of a squared plus b squared is taken and then checked if it is zero, it would return a different result.

DONE.
