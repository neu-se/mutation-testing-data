  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(module.js"
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex would not match the string "module.js" if it is not followed by a colon.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"module.js:"
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex would match the string "module.js" followed by a colon, but not the string "module.js" followed by any other character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"module.js:"
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex would match the string "module.js" followed by a colon, but not the string "module.js" followed by any other character.

DONE.
