Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === 'string' && define['amd']
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `define` is a string instead of a function, which will always evaluate to false, causing the module to not be defined as an AMD module.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === 'function' && define['commonjs']
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the presence of a 'commonjs' property instead of 'amd', which would also lead to the module not being defined correctly for AMD.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === 'function' && !define['amd']
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the check for 'amd', meaning that if `define` is a function but does not have the 'amd' property, the module will not be defined as intended.

DONE.
