  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the entire `arguments` object to the `array_slice` function, while this modified code fragment passes a slice of the `arguments` object starting from the second argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the entire `arguments` object to the `array_slice` function, while this modified code fragment passes a slice of the `arguments` object starting from the first argument and ending at the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the entire `arguments` object to the `array_slice` function, while this modified code fragment passes a slice of the `arguments` object starting from the third argument.

DONE.
