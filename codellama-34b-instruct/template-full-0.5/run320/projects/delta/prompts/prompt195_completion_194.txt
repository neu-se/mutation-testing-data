  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNotEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNotEqual` is the opposite of `isEqual`, and would cause the code to enter the `else` branch when the two values are equal, which is the opposite of the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isEqual` is the opposite of `isEqual`, and would cause the code to enter the `else` branch when the two values are equal, which is the opposite of the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
==
```
This would result in different behavior because `==` is the opposite of `isEqual`, and would cause the code to enter the `else` branch when the two values are equal, which is the opposite of the desired behavior.

DONE.
