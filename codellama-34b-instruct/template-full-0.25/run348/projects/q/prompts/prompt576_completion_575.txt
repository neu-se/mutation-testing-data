  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.next
```
This would result in different behavior because `continuer.next` is a different function than `continuer`, and it may have a different implementation that could affect the behavior of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.apply(this, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `continuer.apply(this, arguments)` is a different way of calling the `continuer` function than `continuer.next`, and it may have a different implementation that could affect the behavior of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(this, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `continuer.bind(this, arguments)` is a different way of calling the `continuer` function than `continuer.next`, and it may have a different implementation that could affect the behavior of the program.

DONE.
