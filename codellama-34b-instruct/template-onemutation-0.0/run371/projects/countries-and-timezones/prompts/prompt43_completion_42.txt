  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [id]: getTimezone(id, options) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a timezone object instead of a country object, which would cause the `getAllCountries` function to return a list of timezone objects instead of a list of country objects.

DONE.
