  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimRight().startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `trimRight()` would remove characters from the end of the string instead of the beginning, which could cause the `startsWith` check to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.substring(1).startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring(1)` would remove the first character of the string, which could cause the `startsWith` check to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.toLowerCase().startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `toLowerCase()` would convert the string to lowercase, which could cause the `startsWith` check to fail if the string contains uppercase letters.

DONE.
