  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\\default\\.[a-z]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the backslashes in the regular expression would be treated as literal characters, rather than as escape characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\\default\\.[a-z]+$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regular expression would make it case-insensitive, so that the regular expression would match "default" even if it is written in lowercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\\default\\.[a-z]+$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regular expression would make it global, so that the regular expression would match all occurrences of "default" in the string, rather than just the first one.

DONE.
