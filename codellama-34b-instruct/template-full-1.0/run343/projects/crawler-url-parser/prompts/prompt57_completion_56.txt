  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`URN.format(parsedUrl)`
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the formatted URL using the `URN` module, which may not produce the same result as using the `URL` module directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`currentUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'http://') + '?foo=bar'`
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add the query parameter `?foo=bar` to the URL, regardless of whether it was already present.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`currentUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'http://') + '/./abcd?foo=bar'`
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add the extra path component `/./abcd` to the URL, regardless of whether it was already present, and then add the query parameter
