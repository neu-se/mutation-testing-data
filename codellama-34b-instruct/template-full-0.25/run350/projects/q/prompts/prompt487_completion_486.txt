  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.splice(at, 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove two elements from the `unhandledRejections` array, instead of just one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.splice(at, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove one element from the `unhandledReasons` array, instead of just one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.splice(at, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove one element from the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, instead of just one.

DONE.
