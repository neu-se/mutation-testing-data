  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return the data, regardless of whether the test has failed or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return null, regardless of whether the test has failed or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return both the error and the data, regardless of whether the test has failed or not.

DONE.
