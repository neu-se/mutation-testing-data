  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(point1.longitude + point2.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the bearing between two points, while this replacement calculates the bearing between the two points translated by the sum of their longitudes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(point1.longitude - point2.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the bearing between two points, while this replacement calculates the bearing between the two points with the longitudes subtracted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(point1.longitude * point2.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the bearing between two points, while this replacement calculates the bearing between the two points multiplied by each other.

DONE.
