  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop === null || match[index + 1] !== prop
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop === null` would allow the rule to match even if the property is null, whereas the original code fragment would only match if the property is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop === undefined || match[index + 1] === prop
```
This would result in different behavior because `match[index + 1] === prop` would allow the rule to match even if the property is not undefined, whereas the original code fragment would only match if the property is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop !== undefined || match[index + 1] !== prop
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop !== undefined` would allow the rule to match even if the property is not undefined, whereas the original code fragment would only match if the property is undefined.

DONE.
