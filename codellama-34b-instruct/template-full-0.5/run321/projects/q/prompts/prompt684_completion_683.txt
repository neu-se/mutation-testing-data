  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that returns a new array with a subset of the elements from the original array, whereas `arguments` is an object that contains the arguments passed to a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` is a method that creates a new array from a subset of the elements in an array, whereas `arguments` is an object that contains the arguments passed to a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[].slice.call(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` is a method that creates a new array from a subset of the elements in an array, whereas `arguments` is an object that contains the arguments passed to a function.

DONE.
