  Option 1:

The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return true;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `diff()` function would always return `true`, indicating that the two strings are equivalent, even if they are not. This would lead to incorrect results in the `concat()` function, which relies on the `diff()` function to determine whether two strings are equal.

Option 2:

The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return false;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `diff()` function would always return `false`, indicating that the two strings are not equivalent, even if they are. This would lead to incorrect results in the `concat()` function, which relies on the `diff()` function to determine whether two strings are equal.

Option 3:

The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return !('' + delta.ops).startsWith('' + other.ops);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat()` function would use a different approach to determine whether the two strings are equal. Instead of
