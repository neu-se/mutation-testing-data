  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a, b
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments are combined into a single value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a * a + b * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument is replaced with a different value that is not related to the original argument.

DONE.
