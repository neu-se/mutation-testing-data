  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key
```
This would result in different behavior because the `row.key` property is always a string, whereas `row.val` can be any value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `row.val` property is always a number, whereas `row.key` is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `row.val` property is always a number, whereas `row.key` is a string.

DONE.
