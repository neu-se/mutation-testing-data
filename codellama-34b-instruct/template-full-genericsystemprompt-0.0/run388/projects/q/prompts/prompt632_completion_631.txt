  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an array with two copies of the key as the second argument to `dispatch`, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an array with the key and value as the second argument to `dispatch`, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[value]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an array with the value as the second argument to `dispatch`, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
