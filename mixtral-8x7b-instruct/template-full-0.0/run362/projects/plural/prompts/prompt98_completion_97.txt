 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
''.concat(w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies')
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `concat` method instead of the `+` operator for string concatenation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
w.replace(/y$/, 'ies')
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `replace` method with a regular expression instead of the `substr` and `slice` methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
''.concat(w.slice(0, -1), 'ies')
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `slice` method and the `concat` method instead of the `substr` method.

DONE.
