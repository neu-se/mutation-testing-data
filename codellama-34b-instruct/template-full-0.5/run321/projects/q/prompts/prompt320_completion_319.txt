  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op].call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments, while `apply` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and an array of arguments. Using `call` instead of `apply` would cause the function to be called with the wrong arguments, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op].bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` is a method that creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` value set to the first argument, and has the remaining arguments as the arguments to the original function. Using `bind` instead of `apply` would cause the function to be called with the wrong `this` value and arguments, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op].apply(descriptor, args)
