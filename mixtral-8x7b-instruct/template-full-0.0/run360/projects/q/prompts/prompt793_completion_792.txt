 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q(object).spread
```
This would result in different behavior because `.spread` expects an array as input, while `.then` accepts any value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q(object).all
```
This would result in different behavior because `.all` waits for all promises in the input array to be resolved, while `.then` only waits for the first resolved promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q(object).race
