  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the length is less than or equal to 0, while the new code fragment checks if the length is strictly less than 0. This means that the new code fragment would not consider a length of 0 to be invalid, while the original code fragment would.

DONE.
