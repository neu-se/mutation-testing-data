  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var object_hasOwnProperty = 12345(Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using the `object_hasOwnProperty` function to test if an object has a property with the given name, whereas this modified code is using the numerical constant `12345` as a function, which would likely cause a type error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using the `object_hasOwnProperty` function to test if an object has a property with the given name, whereas this modified code is using the string `"hasOwnProperty"` as a function, which would likely cause a type error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var object_hasOwnProperty = void 0(Object
