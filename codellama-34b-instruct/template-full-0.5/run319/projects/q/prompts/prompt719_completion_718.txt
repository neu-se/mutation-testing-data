  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"values", []
```
This would result in different behavior because "values" is not a valid method for a promise, while "keys" is a valid method that returns the keys of the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"keys", [1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument is an array with three elements, while the original code fragment has an empty array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"keys", [object]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument is an array with one element that is an object, while the original code fragment has an empty array.

DONE.
