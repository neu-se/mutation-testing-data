  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(null, onRejected)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code currently handles both fulfilled and rejected promises, while this new code only handles rejected promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `when` function to handle both fulfilled and rejected promises, while this new code uses the `then` function to handle only rejected promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(promise, null, onRejected)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code currently handles both fulfilled and rejected promises, while this new code only handles rejected promises.

DONE.
