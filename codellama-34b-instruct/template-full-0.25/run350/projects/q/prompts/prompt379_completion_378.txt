  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a specific `this` value and a bound argument list, whereas the original code simply calls the `callback` function with the `value` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(null, [value])
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` calls the `callback` function with the `value` argument as the first argument, whereas the original code simply calls the `callback` function with the `value` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call(null, value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` calls the `callback` function with the `value` argument as the first argument, whereas the original code simply calls the `callback` function with the `value` argument.

DONE.
