  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x ^ 2
```
This would result in different behavior because before raising x to the power of 2, it would first be implicitly converted to an integer using JavaScript's ToNumber() operator, which would lose the decimal part of x, resulting in a different answer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x << 2
```
This would result in different behavior because x would first be converted to a 32-bit integer, and then left-shifted 2 bits. This would have the effect of multiplying x by 4, resulting in a different result than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI * x
```
This would result in different behavior because Math.PI is a mathematical constant with a value of approximately 3.14159, so multiplying it by x would result in a different result than the original code.

DONE.
