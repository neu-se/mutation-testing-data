  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.insert` is a different property than `thisOp.attributes`, and it may not be possible to access the same data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.attributes` is a different property than `thisOp.attributes`, and it may not be possible to access the same data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.retain` is a different property than `thisOp.attributes`, and it may not be possible to access the same data.

DONE.
