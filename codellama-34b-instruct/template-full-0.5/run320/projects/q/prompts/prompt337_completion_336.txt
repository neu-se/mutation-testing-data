  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state !== "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for inequality, so the code would enter the `if` block if the state is not "rejected".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state !== "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for inequality, so the code would enter the `if` block if the state is not "pending".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state !== "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for inequality, so the code would enter the `if` block if the state is not "fulfilled".

DONE.
