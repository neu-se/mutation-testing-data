  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain + firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because when `firstLeft` is non-zero, the expression `firstOther.retain - firstLeft` would be negative, while `firstOther.retain + firstLeft` would be positive. This change would result in a different number of iterations in the while loop, potentially causing the loop to execute more or fewer times than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.delete + firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because when `firstLeft` is non-zero, the expression `firstOther.retain - firstLeft` would be negative, while `firstOther.delete + firstLeft` would be positive. This change would result in a different number of iterations in the while loop, potentially causing the loop to execute more or fewer times than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.insert + firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because when `
