  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(abort, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function is called with the `abort` argument, which is not the intended behavior. The original code fragment only calls `read` with the `cb` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read(abort, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_read` function is called with the `abort` argument, which is not the intended behavior. The original code fragment only calls `_read` with the `cb` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(null, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function is called with `null` as the first argument, which is not the intended behavior. The original code fragment only calls `read` with the `cb` argument.

DONE.
