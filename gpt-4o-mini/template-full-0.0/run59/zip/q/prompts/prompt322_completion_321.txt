Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[null]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the input to the `descriptor[op]` method to an array containing a single `null` value, which may not be the expected arguments and could lead to unexpected results or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it only passes the first argument of the `args` array to the `descriptor[op]` method, potentially ignoring other important arguments that the operation might require.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes `undefined` as the argument to the `descriptor[op]` method, which could lead to different execution paths or errors if the method expects a valid value.

DONE.
