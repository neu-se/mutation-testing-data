  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.longStackSupport || hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would cause the return value to be `true` if either `Q.longStackSupport` or `hasStacks` is truthy, whereas the original code used the `&&` operator which would return `true` only if both values were truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Q.longStackSupport && hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the value of `Q.longStackSupport`, causing the return value to always be `false` regardless of the value of `hasStacks`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always return the value of `hasStacks`, regardless of the value of `Q.longStackSupport`.

DONE.
