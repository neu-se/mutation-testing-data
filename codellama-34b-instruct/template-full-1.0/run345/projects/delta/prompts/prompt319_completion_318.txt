  Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
inverted.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `inverted.retain` to retain the inverted delta, while the new code would delete the inverted delta instead.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
inverted.retain(Op.length(thisOp))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `inverted.retain` to retain the length of the inverted delta, while the new code would retain the length of the original delta instead.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
inverted.retain(Op.length(otherOp))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `inverted.retain` to retain the length of the inverted delta, while the new code would retain the length of the other delta instead.

DONE.
