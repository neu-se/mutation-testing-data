 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'b'.constructor.name
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the string 'String' instead of the actual keys of the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
['key1', 'key2'].includes(embedType) ? 'key1' : 'key2'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return either 'key1' or 'key2' based on the length of the array, instead of the actual keys of the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Reflect.ownKeys(a)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the keys of the object in the order they were defined, which may not match the keys of the second object.

DONE.
