  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would be called regardless of whether the function call failed or succeeded, whereas `deferred.reject` would only be called if the function call failed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would be called regardless of whether the function call failed or succeeded, whereas `deferred.resolve` would only be called if the function call succeeded.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` would be called regardless of whether the function call failed or succeeded, whereas `deferred.resolve` or `deferred.reject` would only be called if the function call failed or succeeded.

DONE.
