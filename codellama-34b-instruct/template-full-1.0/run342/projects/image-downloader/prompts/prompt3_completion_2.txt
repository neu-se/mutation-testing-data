  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The options.url is required')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The options.dest is required')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The options.url and options.dest are required')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different.

DONE.
