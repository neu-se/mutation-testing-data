  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method takes the index at which to start removing elements as the second argument, not the number of elements to remove.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method takes the index at which to start removing elements as the second argument, not the number of elements to remove.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method takes the index at which to start removing elements as the second argument, not the number of elements to remove.

DONE.
