  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname` returns the directory name of the path, whereas `pathname` returns the file name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename(options.dest, path.extname(options.dest))
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.basename` returns the file name without the extension, whereas `pathname` returns the file name with the extension.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.parse(options.dest).base
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.parse` returns an object with information about the path, whereas `pathname` returns a string.

DONE.
