  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name += 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the name, which would cause the getTimezone function to return a different value than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name = "Something Else"
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the name to a different string, which would cause the getTimezone function to return a different value than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name === "Valid Timezone" ? getTimezone(name) : null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the name is a valid timezone, and if it is, it returns the result of calling getTimezone with the name, otherwise it returns null. This would cause the getTimezone function to return a different value than expected if the name is not a valid timezone.

DONE.
