  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Test error");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `flush` would not throw an error, but the new code fragment would throw an error unconditionally.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (Math.random() < 0.5) {
  throw new Error("Test error");
} else {
  flush();
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `flush` would always be called, but the new code fragment would only call `flush` with a 50% probability.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (typeof process !== "undefined" && process.env.NODE_ENV === "production") {
  throw new Error("Test error");
} else {
  flush();
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `flush` would always be called, but the new code fragment would only call `flush` if
