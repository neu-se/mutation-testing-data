  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 0, 0)` would return an empty array, while `arguments` would return an array of all the function's arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.arguments` would refer to the `arguments` object of the current context, while `arguments` would refer to the `arguments` object of the function being called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number(arguments[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number(arguments[0])` would convert the first argument to a number, while `arguments` would return the reference to the array of arguments.

DONE.
