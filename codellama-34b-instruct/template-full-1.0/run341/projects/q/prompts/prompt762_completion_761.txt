  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
+ Q
```
This would result in different behavior because a `+` operator would cause the resulting array to contain duplicate values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q * Q
```
This would result in different behavior because a `*` operator would cause the resulting array to contain the square of the original values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q ** 2
```
This would result in different behavior because a `**` operator would cause the resulting array to contain the square of the original values.

DONE.
