  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return exception;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the exception instead of rejecting it, which is the intended behavior in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Error(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new Error object with the exception as the message, instead of rejecting the promise, which is the intended behavior in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw exception;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw the exception instead of rejecting the promise, which is the intended behavior in the original code.

DONE.
