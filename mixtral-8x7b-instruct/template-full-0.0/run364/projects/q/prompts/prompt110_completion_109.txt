 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
i === value
```
This would result in different behavior because it compares the index and the value using `===` instead of checking if the value at the current index equals the given value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this[i] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the value at the current index is `undefined` instead of comparing it to the given value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0 === value
```
This would result in different behavior because it always checks if the value is equal to `0`, regardless of the current index.

DONE.
