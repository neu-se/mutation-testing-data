  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Q.ninvoke: Error"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls `deferred.reject` with the error object, while this new code fragment also creates a new `Error` object with the message "Q.ninvoke: Error".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls `deferred.reject` with the error object, while this new code fragment calls `deferred.resolve` with `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify("Q.ninvoke: Notification");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls `deferred.reject` with the error object, while this new code fragment also calls `deferred.notify` with the message "Q.ninvoke: Notification".

DONE.
