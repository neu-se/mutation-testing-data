Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Q.join` function to always return `y`, regardless of whether `x` and `y` are the same, leading to incorrect promise resolution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Q.join` function to always reject, as `undefined` is not a valid promise value, and thus the equality check will always fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the comparison from checking if `x` and `y` are the same to checking if `x + 1` and `y` are the same, which would lead to incorrect promise resolution if `y` is not equal to `x + 1`.

DONE.
