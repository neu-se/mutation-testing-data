  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nfapply` method expects an array as its second argument, and passing `null` would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nfapply` method expects an array with at least one element as its second argument, and passing an empty array would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nfapply` method expects an array with the same number of elements as the number of arguments passed to the callback function, and passing an array with three elements would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown if the callback function only accepts two arguments.

DONE.
