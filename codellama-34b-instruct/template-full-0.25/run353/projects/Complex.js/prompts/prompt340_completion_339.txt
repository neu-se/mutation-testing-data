  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 && b === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would always be false, even if `a` and `b` are both zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 || b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be true if either `a` or `b` is zero, not just when both are zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 && b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be true if `a` is zero and `b` is not zero, not just when both are zero.

DONE.
