  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because if the promise is resolved with a value that is not undefined, the `become` function would not be called, and the promise would not be resolved with the new promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because if the promise is resolved with a value that is undefined, the `become` function would be called, and the promise would be resolved with the new promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === null
```
This would result in different behavior because if the promise is resolved with a value that is null, the `become` function would not be called, and the promise would not be resolved with the new promise.

DONE.
