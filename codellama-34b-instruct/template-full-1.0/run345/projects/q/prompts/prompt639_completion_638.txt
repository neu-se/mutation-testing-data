  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the property `key` of the object, rather than deleting it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"missing", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error, as there is no `missing` method on the `Promise` prototype.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invoke the `post` method of the object, rather than delete the property `key`.

DONE.
