  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```diff
- case 4: return pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3])
+ case 4: return pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[4])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the fifth element of the `ref` array, whereas the modified code fragment uses the fourth element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```diff
- case 4: return pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3])
+ case 4: return pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[3], ref[4])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the third and fourth elements of the `ref` array, whereas the modified code fragment uses the third and fifth elements.
