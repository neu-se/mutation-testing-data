  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return false;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `runSingle` function to always return `false`, instead of executing the task passed as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `runSingle` function to throw an error, instead of executing the task passed as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
head.task = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the task pointer to be set to `null`, instead of the task being executed.

DONE.
