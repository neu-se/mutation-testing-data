  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment emits an error event with the actual error object, while the new code fragment emits an error event with a null object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error('Custom error message')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment emits an error event with the actual error object, while the new code fragment emits an error event with a custom error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', err.message
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment emits an error event with the actual error object, while the new code fragment emits an error event with the error message.

DONE.
