  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort && onAbort()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `onAbort` function instead of passing it as an argument to `abortCb`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the `onAbort` function instead of passing it as an argument to `abortCb`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the type of the `onAbort` function instead of passing it as an argument to `abortCb`.

DONE.
