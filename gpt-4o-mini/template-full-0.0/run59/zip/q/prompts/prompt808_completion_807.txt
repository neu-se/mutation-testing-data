Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would resolve to `null` instead of the original object, potentially leading to unexpected results in the promise chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would resolve to `undefined`, which could cause issues if the subsequent code expects a valid object to operate on.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(new Error("Forced rejection"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately reject the promise with a new error, altering the flow of execution and potentially causing unhandled promise rejections.

DONE.
