  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only applies the rule to words that end with "o", while the new code fragment applies the rule to words that end with "o" and also contain a vowel.

DONE.
