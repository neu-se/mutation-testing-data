  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Q can't get fulfillment value from any promise, all promises were rejected. Last error message: " + rejection.message);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment, `noop`, does not throw an error, but the new code fragment does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(rejection);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment, `noop`, does not reject the promise, but the new code fragment does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(rejection);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment, `noop`, does not resolve the promise, but the new code fragment does.

DONE.
