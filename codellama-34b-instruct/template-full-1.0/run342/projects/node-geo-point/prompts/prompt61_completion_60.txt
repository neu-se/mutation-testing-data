  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(Δλ) * Math.cos(φ2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `cos(φ1)` instead of `Math.cos(φ1)`, which could cause the calculation to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(φ1) * Math.cos(Δλ);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `cos(φ2)` instead of `Math.cos(φ2)`, which could cause the calculation to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan(φ1) * Math.tan(Δλ);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `cos(φ1) * sin(Δλ)` instead of `Math.tan(φ1) * Math.tan(Δλ)`, which could cause the calculation to return a different value.

DONE.
