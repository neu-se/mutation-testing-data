  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin` and `cos` are inverse trigonometric functions, and they have different ranges and patterns. In the original code, `cos` is used to calculate the distance between two points on a sphere, and replacing it with `sin` would result in a different distance calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `tan` and `cos` have different ranges and patterns, and `tan` is not a suitable replacement for `cos` in this context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `acos` is the inverse of `cos`, and it would result in a different distance calculation.

DONE.
