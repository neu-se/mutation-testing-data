  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > len
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never be entered, as the condition `i > len` is always false when `i` starts at 0 and `len` is a positive integer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i -= len
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate indefinitely, as the condition `i < len` would always be true when `i` is decremented by `len` each iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = len - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only iterate once, as the condition `i < len` would be false when `i` is set to `len - 1`.

DONE.
