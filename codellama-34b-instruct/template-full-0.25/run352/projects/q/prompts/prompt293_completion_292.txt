  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject, deferred.resolve, deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments has been changed, which could cause issues if the functions are not called in the correct order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve, deferred.reject, deferred.notify.bind(deferred)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method is being used to ensure that the `this` context is correct when the `notify` function is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve, deferred.reject, deferred.notify.call(deferred)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method is being used to set the `this` context to `deferred` when the `notify` function is called.

DONE.
