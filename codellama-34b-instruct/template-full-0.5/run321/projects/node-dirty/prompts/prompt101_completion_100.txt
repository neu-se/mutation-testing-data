  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val == undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `==` checks for equality after converting the operands to the same type, while `===` checks for strict equality without type conversion. In this case, if `row.val` is `null` or `0`, the condition would evaluate to `true` with `==` but `false` with `===`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `!==` checks for strict inequality, while `!=` checks for inequality after converting the operands to the same type. In this case, if `row.val` is `null` or `0`, the condition would evaluate to `false` with `!==` but `true` with `!=`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!row.hasOwnProperty('val')
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasOwnProperty` checks if the object
