  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because `!test` is the logical negation of `test`, which means it will return the opposite boolean value. If `test` is truthy, `!test` will be falsy, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.property
```
This would result in different behavior because `.property` is a reference to a property of the `test` object, which may or may not exist. If the property exists, it will be returned. If the property does not exist, the result will be `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.method()
```
This would result in different behavior because `.method()` is a method call on the `test` object, which may or may not exist. If the method exists, it will be called. If the method does not exist, the result will be `undefined`.

DONE.
