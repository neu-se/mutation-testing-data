Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Some error occurred"));
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of resolving the promise with the fulfilled values, it would immediately reject the promise with a new error, causing any consumers of this promise to handle a rejection instead of a successful resolution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(promises.length);
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of resolving the promise with the array of fulfilled values, it would resolve it with the count of promises, which is not the expected behavior and would lead to incorrect handling of the resolved values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(promises[0]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with only the first promise's value instead of the array of all fulfilled values, which would not provide the complete set of results as intended.

DONE.
