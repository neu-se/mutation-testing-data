  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/.*@(.+):(\d+)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is not matching the same pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/.*@(.+):(\d+)$/.match
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is not matching the same pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/.*@(.+):(\d+)$/.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is not matching the same pattern.

DONE.
