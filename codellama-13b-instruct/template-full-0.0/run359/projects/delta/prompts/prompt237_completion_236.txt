  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `opLength` variable is used to determine the length of the operation, and adding 1 to it would cause the operation to be applied to the next character instead of the current one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `opLength` variable is used to determine the length of the operation, and subtracting 1 from it would cause the operation to be applied to the previous character instead of the current one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(opLength / 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `opLength` variable is used to determine the length of the operation, and dividing it by 2 would cause the operation to be applied to half of the characters instead of the full length.

DONE.
