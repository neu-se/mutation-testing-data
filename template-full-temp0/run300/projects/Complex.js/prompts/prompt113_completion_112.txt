  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this instanceof Number
```
This would result in different behavior because `this instanceof Number` would always return `false`, as `this` is an instance of `Complex`, not `Number`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this instanceof String
```
This would result in different behavior because `this instanceof String` would always return `false`, as `this` is an instance of `Complex`, not `String`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this instanceof Array
```
This would result in different behavior because `this instanceof Array` would always return `false`, as `this` is an instance of `Complex`, not `Array`.

DONE.
