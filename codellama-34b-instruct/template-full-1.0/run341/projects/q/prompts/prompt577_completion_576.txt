  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"send"
```
This would result in different behavior because in Python-style generators, "send" is a reserved word used to send a value to the generator, while "next" is used to retrieve the next value from the generator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"yield"
```
This would result in different behavior because in Python-style generators, "yield" is used to send a value to the generator, while "next" is used to retrieve the next value from the generator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"throw"
```
This would result in different behavior because in Python-style generators, "throw" is used to raise an exception and exit the generator, while "next" is used to retrieve the next value from the generator.

DONE.
