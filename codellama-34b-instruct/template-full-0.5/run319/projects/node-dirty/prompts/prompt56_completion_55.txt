  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.close()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close()` method is called twice, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.close()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close()` method is called twice, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.close()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close()` method is called twice, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
