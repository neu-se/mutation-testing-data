  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount < 0
```
This change will cause the `all` function to resolve the promise with an empty array, even if there are still pending promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount > 0
```
This change will cause the `all` function to never resolve the promise, even if all of the promises have been fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount === promises.length
```
This change will cause the `all` function to resolve the promise with an array of the same length as the input array, but with all of the values set to `undefined`.

DONE.
