  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Number.isFinite(a['abs']) && Number.isFinite(a['arg'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator was removed, and the `Number.isFinite()` function is now evaluated on the `abs` property instead of the `arg` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isFinite(a['abs']) || Number.isFinite(a['arg'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator was added, and the `Number.isFinite()` function is now evaluated on the `abs` property or the `arg` property, whereas the original code fragment only evaluated it on the `arg` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Boolean(Number.isFinite(a['abs']) && Number.isFinite(a['arg']))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Boolean()` function was added to convert the result
