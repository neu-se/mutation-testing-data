  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `task` is a reference to a function, while `task()` is a function call. This would cause the function to be executed immediately, rather than being passed as an argument to `nextTick`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `task` is a reference to a function, while `task.call()` is a function call with an empty `this` context. This would cause the function to be executed with a different `this` context, which could have unintended consequences.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task.bind()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `task` is a reference to a function, while `task.bind()` is a function call that creates a new function with a bound `this` context. This would cause the function to be executed with a different `
