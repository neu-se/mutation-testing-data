  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function is called instead of the `resolve` function, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function is called with a `null` value instead of the expected `filename` object, which would cause the promise to be resolved with a `null` value instead of the expected `filename` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve({ filename: 'wrong_file' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function is called with a `filename` object that has a different value than the expected `filename` object, which would cause the promise to be resolved with a different value than the expected `filename` object.

DONE.
