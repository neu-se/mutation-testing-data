  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because `[]` is an empty array, and `args` is likely expected to be an array of arguments passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an array, and `args` is likely expected to be an array of arguments passed to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{args}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{args}` is an object with the property `args` rather than an array of arguments.

DONE.
