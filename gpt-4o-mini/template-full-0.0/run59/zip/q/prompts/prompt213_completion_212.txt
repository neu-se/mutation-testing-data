Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof value === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if the value is an object, which could incorrectly classify non-promise objects as promise-like, leading to unexpected behavior in promise handling.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value instanceof Array
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the value is an instance of an Array, which would exclude valid promise-like objects that are not arrays, causing them to be treated as non-promise values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the value is strictly equal to null, which would incorrectly classify null as a promise-like object, leading to potential errors in promise resolution logic.

DONE.
