Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to terminate when there are still operations left to process, effectively skipping any remaining operations in the `Delta`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only continue if the next operation is of type 'insert', potentially ignoring other operation types like 'delete' or 'equal', which could lead to incomplete processing of the `Delta`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the loop to continue as long as there are operations with a positive length, which could lead to incorrect handling of operations that should be processed but have a length of zero.

DONE.
