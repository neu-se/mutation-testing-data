  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `href` attribute of the current element, which is not the same as the `href` attribute of the `a` element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('a').attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `href` attribute of the first `a` element in the document, which is not the same as the `href` attribute of the current element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('a[href]').attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `href` attribute of the first `a` element with a `href` attribute in the document, which is not the same as the `href` attribute of the current element.

DONE.
