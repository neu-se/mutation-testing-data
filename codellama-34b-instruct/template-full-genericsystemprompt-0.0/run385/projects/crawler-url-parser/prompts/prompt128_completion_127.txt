  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `pageurl` is a string, while this replacement checks if `pageurl` is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.length == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `pageurl` is a string, while this replacement checks if `pageurl` is an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.indexOf("http") == -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `pageurl` is a string, while this replacement checks if `pageurl` does not contain the substring "http".

DONE.
