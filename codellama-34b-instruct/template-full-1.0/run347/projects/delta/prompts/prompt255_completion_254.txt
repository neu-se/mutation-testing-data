  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `opLength - 1` calculation would occur one operation earlier in the iterator, potentially causing the algorithm to miss an operation or process an operation twice.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `opLength * 2` calculation would cause the algorithm to skip over every other operation in the iterator, potentially causing some operations to be missed or processed twice.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength + 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the `opLength + 10` calculation would cause the algorithm to process the same operation multiple times, potentially causing errors or inconsistencies in the final result.

DONE.
