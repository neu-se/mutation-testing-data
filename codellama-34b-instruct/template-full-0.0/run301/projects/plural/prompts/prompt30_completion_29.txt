  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis|thesis/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional "thesis" at the end of the regular expression would cause the regular expression to match the string "thesis" twice, resulting in a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis|crisis/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional "crisis" at the end of the regular expression would cause the regular expression to match the string "crisis" twice, resulting in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis|thesis|crisis/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional "thesis" and "crisis" at the end of the regular expression would cause the regular expression to match the string "thesis" and "crisis" twice, resulting in a different output.

DONE.
