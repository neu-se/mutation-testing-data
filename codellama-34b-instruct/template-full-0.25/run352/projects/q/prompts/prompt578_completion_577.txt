  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer, "throw"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "throw" operator would cause the generator to throw an exception, rather than returning the next value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer, "return"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "return" operator would cause the generator to return a value, rather than returning the next value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer, "yield"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "yield" operator would cause the generator to yield a value, rather than returning the next value.

DONE.
