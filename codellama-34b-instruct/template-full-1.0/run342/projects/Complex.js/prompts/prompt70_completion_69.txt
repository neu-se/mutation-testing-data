  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.split("")
```
This would result in different behavior because while `match` returns an array of all matches, `split` returns an array of substrings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because while `match` returns an array of all matches, `slice` returns a shallow copy of the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.map(c => c)
```
This would result in different behavior because while `match` returns an array of all matches, `map` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

DONE.
