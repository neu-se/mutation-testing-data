  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude, zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because it would swap the latitude and longitude values, which could cause the `toTile` method to return an incorrect tile.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude, zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because it would swap the longitude and latitude values, which could cause the `toTile` method to return an incorrect tile.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude + this.longitude, zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the latitude and longitude values together, which could cause the `toTile` method to return an incorrect tile.

DONE.
