  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `indexOf` method would be called with a different argument, which could cause it to return a different index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `indexOf` method would be called with a different argument, which could cause it to return a different index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `indexOf` method would be called with a different argument, which could cause it to return a different index.

DONE.
