  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `done` is a function and then calls it, but replacing it with `null` would cause the code to throw an error when trying to call `null` as a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `done` is a function and then calls it, but replacing it with `undefined` would cause the code to throw an error when trying to call `undefined` as a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `done` is a function and then calls it, but replacing it with an empty function would cause the code to call the empty function instead of the original `done` function.

DONE.
