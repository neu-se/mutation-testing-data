  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!path.isAbsolute
```
This would result in different behavior because `!path.isAbsolute` would always return `false`, even if the `dest` path is absolute. In the original code, `path.isAbsolute` is used to check if the `dest` path is absolute, and if it is, it is resolved with `path.resolve`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isAbsolute(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.isAbsolute(options.dest)` would return `true` if the `dest` path is absolute, and `false` otherwise. In the original code, `path.isAbsolute` is used to check if the `dest` path is absolute, and if it is, it is resolved with `path.resolve`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isAbsolute(options.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path
