  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes, otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the attributes of the other op instead of the base op, which could cause the transformation to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes, {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use an empty object as the base attributes, which could cause the transformation to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use null as the base attributes, which could cause the transformation to behave differently.

DONE.
