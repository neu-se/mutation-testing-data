  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test()` method expects a regular expression as its first argument, but `str.length` is a number, which would cause the method to throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test()` method would only match the first character of the string, rather than the entire string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test()` method would only match the substring of the string starting from the second character, rather than the entire string.

DONE.
