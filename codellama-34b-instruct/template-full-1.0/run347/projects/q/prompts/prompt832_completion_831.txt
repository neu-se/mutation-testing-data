  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the rejected promise to be returned, which would signal that the operation was not performed successfully.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the error to be thrown, which would indicate that the operation was not performed successfully.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the promise to be fulfilled with no value, which would indicate that the operation was performed successfully but with no result.

DONE.
