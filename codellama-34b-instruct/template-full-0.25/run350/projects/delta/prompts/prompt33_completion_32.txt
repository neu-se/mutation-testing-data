  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attr[key] !== base[key] && base[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, meaning that `attr[key]` and `base[key]` must have different values and types. In contrast, the original code fragment uses `!=` which checks for non-strict inequality, meaning that `attr[key]` and `base[key]` must have different values, but can have the same type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attr[key] !== base[key] && base[key] === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, meaning that `attr[key]` and `base[key]` must have the same value and type. In contrast, the original code fragment uses `!=` which checks for non-strict inequality, meaning that `attr[key]` and `base[key]` must have different values, but can have the same type.

Option 3: The
