  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/at (\w+):(\d+):(?:\d+)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because the first capturing group would match any word character instead of a non-space character, which would result in different capture groups and a different error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/at ([\w\d]+):(\d+):(?:\d+)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because the first capturing group would match any word character or digit, which would result in a different error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/at ^([\w\d]+):(\d+):(?:\d+)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because the first capturing group would match any word character or digit at the beginning of the string, which would result in a different error message.

DONE.
