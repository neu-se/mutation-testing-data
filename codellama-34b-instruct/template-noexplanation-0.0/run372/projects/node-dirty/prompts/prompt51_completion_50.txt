  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set
```
This change will cause the `update` method to call the `set` method instead of the `get` method, which will result in a different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rm
```
This change will cause the `update` method to call the `rm` method instead of the `get` method, which will result in a different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.forEach
```
This change will cause the `update` method to call the `forEach` method instead of the `get` method, which will result in a different behavior.

DONE.
