Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the presence of an `insert` property instead of a `delete` property, potentially leading to incorrect handling of operations that should be deleted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `retain` property is `undefined`, which would skip over valid operations that should be processed, leading to incorrect transformations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `length` property of the operation is greater than zero, which could incorrectly allow operations that should be ignored or treated differently based on their length.

DONE.
