  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while the original code fragment simply passes the `args` array as is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat(["new argument"])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method creates a new array by merging two or more arrays, while the original code fragment simply passes the `args` array as is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.filter(function(arg) { return arg !== "new argument"; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, while the original code fragment simply passes the `args` array as is.

DONE.
