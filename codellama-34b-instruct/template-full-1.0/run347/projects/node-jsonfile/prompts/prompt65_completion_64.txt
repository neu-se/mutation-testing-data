  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.split('\n').join(EOL)
```
This would result in different behavior because `content.split` would split the content into an array of lines, while `content.replace` would replace all occurrences of the newline character with `EOL`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.slice(0, content.length - 1) + EOL
```
This would result in different behavior because `content.slice` would extract a substring from the content, while `content.replace` would replace all occurrences of the newline character with `EOL`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^\uFEFF/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/^\uFEFF/` matches a different pattern than `/\n/g`.

DONE.
