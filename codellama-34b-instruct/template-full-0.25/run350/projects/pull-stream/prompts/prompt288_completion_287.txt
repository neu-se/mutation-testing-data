  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end, data` passes the `data` value to the `cb` function, while the new code fragment `end, null` passes `null` instead. This could cause the test to pass even if the `mapper` function is not working correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end, data` passes the `data` value to the `cb` function, while the new code fragment `end, undefined` passes `undefined` instead. This could cause the test to pass even if the `mapper` function is not working correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end, data
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end, data` passes the `data` value to the `cb` function if `end` is `false`, while the new code fragment `
