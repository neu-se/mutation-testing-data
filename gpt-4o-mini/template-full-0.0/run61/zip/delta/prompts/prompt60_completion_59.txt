Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof arg !== 'string' || arg.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow non-string values or non-empty strings to be processed, potentially leading to unexpected results when inserting operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow empty strings to be treated as valid input, which contradicts the original intent of rejecting empty strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof arg === 'string' && arg.length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition will always evaluate to false (since string lengths cannot be negative), allowing all insert operations to proceed regardless of the string's length.

DONE.
