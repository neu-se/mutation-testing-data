  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = !end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment updates `ended` to be equal to `end`, while this new code fragment updates `ended` to be the opposite of `end`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = end && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment updates `ended` to be equal to `end`, while this new code fragment updates `ended` to be `false` regardless of the value of `end`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = end || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment updates `ended` to be equal to `end`, while this new code fragment updates `ended` to be `true` if `end` is truthy.

DONE.
