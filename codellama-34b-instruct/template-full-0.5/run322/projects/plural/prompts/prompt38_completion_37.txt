  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|indices/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches "index" but not "indices," whereas the new code fragment matches "indices" but not "index."

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|indexes/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches "index" but not "indexes," whereas the new code fragment matches "indexes" but not "index."

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|indices|indexes/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches "index" but not "indices" or "indexes," whereas the new code fragment matches "indices" or "indexes" but not "index."

DONE.
