  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, so the `if` statement would not be executed, and `progress` would not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, so the `if` statement would not be executed, and `progress` would not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"hello"` is a truthy value, so the `if` statement would be executed, and `progress` would be called with `"hello"` as an argument.

DONE.
