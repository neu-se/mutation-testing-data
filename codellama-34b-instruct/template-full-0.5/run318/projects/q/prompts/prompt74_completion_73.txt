  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `setTimeout` would be `1` instead of `0`, causing the `flush` function to be called after a delay of `1ms` instead of `0ms`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush, -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `setTimeout` would be `-1` instead of `0`, causing the `flush` function to be called immediately instead of after a delay.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush, "0"
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `setTimeout` would be the string `"0"` instead of the number `0`, causing the `flush` function to be called with the string `"0"` as its argument instead of the number `0`.

DONE.
