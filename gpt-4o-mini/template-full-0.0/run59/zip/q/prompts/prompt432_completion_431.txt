Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly check the state of the promise against the string "fulfilled" instead of using the `inspect()` method, leading to false positives for promises that are not actually fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect().state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly check if the promise is pending instead of checking if it is rejected, causing the `isRejected` method to return true for pending promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect().state !== "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return true for any state that is not rejected, which is the opposite of the intended functionality, thus failing to accurately identify rejected promises.

DONE.
