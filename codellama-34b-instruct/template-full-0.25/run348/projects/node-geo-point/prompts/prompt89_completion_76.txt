  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cos(φ1)` is the cosine of the latitude of the first point, which is not the same as the angular distance `δ` between the two points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin(φ2)` is the sine of the latitude of the second point, which is not the same as the angular distance `δ` between the two points.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ1) * cos(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cos(φ1) * cos(φ2)` is the product of the cosines of the latitudes of the two points, which is not the same as the angular distance `δ` between the two points.

DONE.
