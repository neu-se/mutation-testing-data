  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
finalise()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finalise` function is not called, and the resulting regex would not match the expected paths.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
finalise(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finalise` function is called with an argument, which would cause it to return a different regex.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
finalise(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finalise` function is called with a different argument, which would cause it to return a different regex.

DONE.
