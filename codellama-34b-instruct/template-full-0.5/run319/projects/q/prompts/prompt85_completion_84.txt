  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` expects a function as an argument, but `undefined` is not a function. This would cause the `requestTick` function to throw an error, which would prevent the `nextTick` function from being called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` expects a function as an argument, but `null` is not a function. This would cause the `requestTick` function to throw an error, which would prevent the `nextTick` function from being called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick(function() {});
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` expects a function as an argument, but `function() {}` is not a function that performs any meaningful work. This would cause the `requestTick` function to execute
