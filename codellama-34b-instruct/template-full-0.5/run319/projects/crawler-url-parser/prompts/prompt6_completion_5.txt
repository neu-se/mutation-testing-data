  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of a string is different from the string itself, and could potentially cause the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method of a string returns a new string with all characters in uppercase, which could potentially cause the function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring()` method of a string returns a new string with the specified portion of the original string, which could potentially cause the function to return a different value.

DONE.
