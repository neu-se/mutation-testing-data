 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment, `result.value`, would not be executed and instead `null` would be returned. This could cause issues if the following code expects `result.value` to be executed and have a specific value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the number `1` would be returned instead of the value of `result.value`. This could cause issues if the following code expects a certain value to be returned and instead receives `1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.otherValue
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now be trying to access the property `otherValue` of the `result` object instead of `value`. If the `result` object does not have an `otherValue` property, this would cause an error.

DONE.
