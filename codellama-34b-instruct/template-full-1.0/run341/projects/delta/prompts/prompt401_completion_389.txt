  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisData
```
This would result in different behavior because it would refer to the `this` keyword, which may have a different value than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[thisData]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new array with a single element, which is not the same as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisData*thisData
```
This would result in different behavior because it would square the value of `thisData`.

DONE.
