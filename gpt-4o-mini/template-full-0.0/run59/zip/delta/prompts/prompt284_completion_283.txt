Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the search string from a newline character to a space character, potentially causing the `indexOf` method to return different results, leading to incorrect line segmentation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\t'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the search string to a tab character, which may not exist in the `insert` string, causing the `indexOf` method to return -1 and altering how lines are processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'newline'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the search string to a literal word 'newline', which is unlikely to be found in the `insert` string, leading to incorrect handling of line breaks and potentially skipping over valid lines.

DONE.
