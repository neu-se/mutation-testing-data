  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from 1 instead of 0, potentially missing the first element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from the last element in the array instead of the first, potentially skipping over other elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = Math.floor(Math.random() * length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from a random element in the array instead of the first, potentially causing the loop to skip over other elements.

DONE.
