  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
snapshot.err
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the error value instead of the resolved value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().err
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the error value instead of the resolved value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with `undefined` instead of the resolved value.

DONE.
