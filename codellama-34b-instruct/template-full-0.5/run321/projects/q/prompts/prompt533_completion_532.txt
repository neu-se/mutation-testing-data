  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function is not defined in the provided code snippet, and would therefore cause a `ReferenceError` to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fulfilled` function is not defined in the provided code snippet, and would therefore cause a `ReferenceError` to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value is not a function, and would therefore cause a `TypeError` to be thrown when the `spread` method is called on it.

DONE.
