Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the original `arguments` with an empty array, causing the bound function to be called without any arguments, which may lead to unexpected results or errors when the original function expects parameters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the original `arguments` with `null`, which would cause the bound function to receive `null` as its arguments, potentially leading to runtime errors if the function does not handle `null` values properly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the original `arguments` with `this`, which refers to the context of the current function rather than the arguments passed to it, likely resulting in incorrect behavior or errors when the original function expects specific arguments.

DONE.
