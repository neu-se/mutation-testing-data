  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stringify(obj, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `stringify(obj, options)`, which calls the `stringify` function with the `obj` and `options` arguments, while the new code fragment calls the `stringify` function with the `obj` argument only, without the `options` argument. This could cause the `stringify` function to behave differently, depending on its implementation.

DONE.
