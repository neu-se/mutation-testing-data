  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be passing the wrong point to the `calculateDistance` method, leading to incorrect calculation and potentially causing the tests to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
number
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be passing a random number instead of a point, leading to invalid calculations and potentially causing the tests to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be passing an undefined point, leading to unexpected behavior and potentially causing the tests to fail.

DONE.
