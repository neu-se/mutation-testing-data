  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\n\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because the extra newline would cause the stack trace to include an extra line, which would change the line number that is used to determine the stopping point for building long stack traces.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\t"
```
This would result in different behavior because the tab character would cause the stack trace to include a tab character, which would change the formatting of the stack trace and potentially cause it to be misinterpreted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because the backslash would cause the newline character to be escaped, which would prevent it from being interpreted as a newline character and would cause the stack trace to include the backslash and the "n" character instead.

DONE.
