 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
path, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it ignores the `ctx` parameter, which could cause issues if the original `matches` method depends on the context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'', ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `path` parameter with an empty string, which could cause issues if the original `matches` method checks the `path` for emptiness or specific values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
policy.matches(path)
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the `ctx` parameter, which could cause issues if the original `matches` method depends on the context.

DONE.
