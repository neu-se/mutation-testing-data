  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `acos` function returns the arc cosine of a number, which is different from the `atan2` function used in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan` function returns the arc tangent of a number, which is different from the `atan2` function used in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.rop(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rop` function does not exist in the `Math` object, and would throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
