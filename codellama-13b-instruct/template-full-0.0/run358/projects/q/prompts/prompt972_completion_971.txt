  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name, args, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional argument `1` would be passed to the `npost` method, which would cause the method to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name, args, "1"
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional argument `"1"` would be passed to the `npost` method, which would cause the method to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name, args, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional argument `null` would be passed to the `npost` method, which would cause the method to fail.

DONE.
