Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Notification failed"));
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of notifying the progress, it would reject the promise with an error, which changes the expected flow of the promise handling.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it resolves the deferred promise with a `null` value instead of notifying the progress, which may lead to unexpected results in the promise chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify("Progress update");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would send a string message as a notification instead of the intended value, potentially altering how progress is handled in the promise chain.

DONE.
