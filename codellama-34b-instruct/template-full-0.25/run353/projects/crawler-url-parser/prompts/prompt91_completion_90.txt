  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(javascript|mailto:|ftp:|http:)/ig.test
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the test to pass for URLs that start with "http:", which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(javascript|mailto:|ftp:|https:)/ig.test
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the test to pass for URLs that start with "https:", which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(javascript|mailto:|ftp:|file:)/ig.test
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the test to pass for URLs that start with "file:", which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
