  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c[options],
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a different method for retrieving the timezone.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c[options + 1],
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a different index for retrieving the timezone.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c[options - 1],
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a different index for retrieving the timezone.

DONE.
