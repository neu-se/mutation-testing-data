 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
rule[0].constructor.name
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the constructor's name of the rule is 'RegExp' instead of checking if the rule itself is a RegExp object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
rule[0] instanceof RegExp
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the rule is an instance of RegExp instead of checking if the rule itself is a RegExp object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
rule[0].test(word) || word === rule[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the rule (RegExp or String) matches the word, instead of checking if the rule is a String and equal to the word.

DONE.
