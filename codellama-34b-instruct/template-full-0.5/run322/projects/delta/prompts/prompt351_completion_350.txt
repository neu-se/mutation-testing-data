  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` method would return a delta with a `null` attribute map, which would cause the `AttributeMap.invert` method to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` method would return a delta with an `undefined` attribute map, which would cause the `AttributeMap.invert` method to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` method would return a delta with an empty attribute map, which would cause the `AttributeMap.invert` method to return an empty delta.

DONE.
