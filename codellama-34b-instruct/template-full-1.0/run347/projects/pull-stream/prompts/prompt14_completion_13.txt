  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i > length; i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the for loop will now iterate in the opposite direction, and the condition for the loop to continue will be met when `i` is greater than `length` instead of less than or equal to `length`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = length - 1; i < length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the for loop will now start at `length - 1` and iterate until `i` is greater than `length`, which means the loop will only execute once instead of `length` times.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = length - 1; i >= 0; i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the for loop will now start at `length - 1` and iterate until `i` is less than zero, which means the loop will execute `length` times instead of once.
