Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index >= start
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the loop to continue as long as the current index is greater than or equal to the start index, potentially skipping operations that should be included in the slice.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would terminate the loop when there are no more operations to iterate over, effectively preventing any operations from being added to the `ops` array if the iterator is exhausted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the loop to continue as long as the index is less than the total number of operations, which could lead to an out-of-bounds error if the `iter.next()` method is called beyond the available operations.

DONE.
