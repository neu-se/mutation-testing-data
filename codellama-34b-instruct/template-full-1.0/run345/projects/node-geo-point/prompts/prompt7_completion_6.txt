  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with that!

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!!point.hasOwnProperty('type') || !!point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates')
```
This would result in different behavior because using double negation (!!) inverts the logic of the previous condition. The new code fragment would return true if either the "type" or "coordinates" property is not present in the object, which is the opposite of the original condition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('type') && point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates')
```
This would result in different behavior because using && (logical AND) expects both conditions to be true, whereas the original condition uses || (logical OR). The new code fragment would only return true if both "type" and "coordinates" properties are present in the object, which is a stricter condition than the original.
