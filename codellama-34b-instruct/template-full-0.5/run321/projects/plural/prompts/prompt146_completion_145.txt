  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rule[0]` expression would be evaluated to a different value than `rule[1]`, which would cause the function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rule[2]` expression would be evaluated to a different value than `rule[1]`, which would cause the function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rule[3]` expression would be evaluated to a different value than `rule[1]`, which would cause the function to return a different result.

DONE.
