  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.splice(at, 1);

This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method is not idempotent, and it would remove the element at index `at` from the `unhandledRejections` array, whereas the original code fragment only removes the element from the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array.
