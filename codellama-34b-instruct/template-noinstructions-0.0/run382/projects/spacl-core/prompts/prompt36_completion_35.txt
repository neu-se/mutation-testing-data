  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().join('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns an array of path segments, while this replacement returns a string of the path segments separated by slashes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().map(decodeURIComponent)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not decode the path segments, while this replacement uses `decodeURIComponent` to decode the path segments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().map(decodeURIComponent).join('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not decode the path segments and does not join the path segments with slashes, while this replacement uses `decodeURIComponent` to decode the path segments and joins the path segments with slashes.

DONE.
