  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow` function expects a positive integer as its second argument, and `0` is not a positive integer. The function would return `1` instead of the expected result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow` function expects a positive integer as its second argument, and `-1` is not a positive integer. The function would return `1` instead of the expected result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow` function expects a finite number as its second argument, and `Infinity` is not a finite number. The function would return `NaN` instead of the expected result.

DONE.
