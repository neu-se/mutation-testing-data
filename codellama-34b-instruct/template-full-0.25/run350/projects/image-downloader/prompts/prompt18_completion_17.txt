  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest, basename
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the original basename instead of the decoded basename, which could lead to different file names being generated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest, path.basename(path.dirname(options.dest))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the basename of the parent directory instead of the basename of the file, which could lead to different file names being generated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest, path.basename(options.dest, path.extname(options.dest))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the basename of the file without the extension, which could lead to different file names being generated.

DONE.
