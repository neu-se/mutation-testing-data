 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.values(tzs)
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns an array of timezone objects instead of using the original object. This might cause issues if the `deliverTimezones` function expects a specific object structure.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
tzs.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a shallow copy of the timezone object. If the `deliverTimezones` function modifies the timezone object, the shallow copy would not reflect those changes, leading to different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.keys(tzs).reduce((obj, key) => { obj[key] = tzs[key]; return obj; }, {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new object with the same keys and values as the original `tzs` object. If the `deliverTimezones` function relies on any
