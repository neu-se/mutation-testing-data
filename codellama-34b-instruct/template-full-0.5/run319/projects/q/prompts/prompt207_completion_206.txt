  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.warn !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `console.warn` is a function, but the replacement code checks if it is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.warn !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `console.warn` is a function, but the replacement code checks if it is not undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof console.warn === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `console.warn` is a function, but the replacement code checks if it is undefined.

DONE.
