 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\n'
```
This would result in different behavior because the backslash before the 'n' would be treated as a literal backslash, not an escape character. The regular expression would then look for a single 'n' character instead of a newline character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[\\n]/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the square brackets create a character class, which matches either the backslash character or the 'n' character. This would again result in the regular expression looking for a literal 'n' character instead of a newline character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\r\n|\n)/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression now matches both Windows-style line breaks (CRLF) and Unix-style line breaks (LF). The original regular expression only matches Unix-style line breaks.

DONE.
