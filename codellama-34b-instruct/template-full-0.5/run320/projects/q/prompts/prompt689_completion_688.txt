  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call"
```
This would result in different behavior because "call" is a different method than "apply", and it would not pass the correct arguments to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"bind"
```
This would result in different behavior because "bind" is a different method than "apply", and it would not execute the function with the correct context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"valueOf"
```
This would result in different behavior because "valueOf" is a different method than "apply", and it would not execute the function with the correct arguments.

DONE.
