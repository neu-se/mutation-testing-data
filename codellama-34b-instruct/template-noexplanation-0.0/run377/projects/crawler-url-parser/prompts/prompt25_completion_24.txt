  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#'
```
This will cause the `replace` method to replace the first occurrence of `#` with an empty string, instead of the first occurrence of `#` followed by any character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#' + ' '
```
This will cause the `replace` method to replace the first occurrence of `#` with an empty string, followed by a space.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#' + ' ' + ' '
```
This will cause the `replace` method to replace the first occurrence of `#` with an empty string, followed by two spaces.

DONE.
