  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther != null &&
      typeof firstOther.retain === 'number' &&
      firstOther.attributes != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attributes` property is now checked for null instead of being checked for null. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if the `attributes` property is null, which would result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther != null &&
      typeof firstOther.retain === 'number' &&
      firstOther.attributes == true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attributes` property is now checked for a boolean value instead of being checked for null. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if the `attributes` property is not a boolean value, which would result in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther != null &&
      typeof firstOther.retain === 'number' &&
