  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const effectiveEmit = thisOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of `effectiveEmit` from `thisOp.insert` to `thisOp.retain`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const effectiveEmit = thisOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of `effectiveEmit` from `thisOp.insert` to `thisOp.retain`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const effectiveEmit = otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of `effectiveEmit` from `thisOp.insert` to `otherOp.insert`.

DONE.
