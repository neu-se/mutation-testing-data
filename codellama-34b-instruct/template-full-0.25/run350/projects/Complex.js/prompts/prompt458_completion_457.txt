  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` checks if the value is `NaN`, while `isInfinite` checks if the value is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` checks if the value is finite, while `isInfinite` checks if the value is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isFinite` checks if the value is not finite, while `isInfinite` checks if the value is infinite.

DONE.
