  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!src
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!src` operator negates the truthiness of `src`, which would cause the `if` statement to be flipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src + ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `src` variable would be coerced to a string, which could cause the `isGlob` function to return `true` instead of `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `src` variable would be divided by 2, which could cause the `isGlob` function to return `true` instead of `false`.

DONE.
