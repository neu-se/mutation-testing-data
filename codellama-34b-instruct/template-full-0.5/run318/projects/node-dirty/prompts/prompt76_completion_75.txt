  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned the number of rows in the database, while this new code fragment would return the negative of that number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.size * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned the number of rows in the database, while this new code fragment would return twice that number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned the number of rows in the database, while this new code fragment would return a random number between 0 and 1.

DONE.
