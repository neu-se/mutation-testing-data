  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`/${part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$1')}/`
```
This would result in different behavior because the extra `/` at the end of the replacement string would cause the regular expression to match an additional character at the end of the string, which is not intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`/${part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$1')}/i`
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the replacement string would cause the regular expression to match case-insensitively, which is not intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`/${part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$1')}/g`
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the replacement string would cause the regular expression to match globally, which is not intended.

DONE.
