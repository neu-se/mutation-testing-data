  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is called with an additional argument, which would cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
