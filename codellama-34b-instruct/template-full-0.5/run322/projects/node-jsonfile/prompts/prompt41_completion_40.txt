  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `_writeFileSync` is a synchronous version of `_writeFile`, and it would not return a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_writeFile.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function that is bound to a specific context, and in this case, it would bind `_writeFile` to `null`, which would result in a different `this` value inside the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_writeFile.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided as an array, and in this case, it would call `_writeFile` with `null` as the `this` value and an empty array as the arguments.

DONE.
