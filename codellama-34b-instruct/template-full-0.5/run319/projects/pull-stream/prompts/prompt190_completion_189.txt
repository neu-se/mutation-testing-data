  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `map` function is falsy, while this replacement checks if the `map` function is `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map !== map
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `map` function is falsy, while this replacement checks if the `map` function is not equal to itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `map` function is falsy, while this replacement checks if the `map` function has a length of 0.

DONE.
