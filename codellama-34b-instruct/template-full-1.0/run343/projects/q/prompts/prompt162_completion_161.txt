  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackString.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(0)` returns an empty string, whereas `split` returns an array of line strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackString.concat("abc")
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat("abc")` adds the string "abc" to the end of `stackString`, whereas `split` returns an array of line strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackString.replace(":", "_")
```
This would result in different behavior because `replace(":", "_")` replaces all occurrences of ":" in `stackString` with underscores, whereas `split` returns an array of line strings.

DONE.
