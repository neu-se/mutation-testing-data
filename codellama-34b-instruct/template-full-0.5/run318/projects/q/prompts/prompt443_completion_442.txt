  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would cause the `reason` object to be coerced into a number, which would likely result in `NaN`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method would be called on the `reason` object, which would return a string representation of the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason.message
```
This would result in different behavior because the `message` property of the `reason` object would be accessed, which would return a string representing the error message.

DONE.
