  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<empty>
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attributes` property would not be accessed, and therefore the `isEqual` comparison would always evaluate to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isEqual` comparison would always evaluate to `true`, since `null` is not an object and does not have properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isEqual` comparison would always evaluate to `true`, since `undefined` is not an object and does not have properties.

DONE.
