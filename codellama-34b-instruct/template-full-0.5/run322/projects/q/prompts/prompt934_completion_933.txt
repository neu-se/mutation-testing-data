  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `denodeify` method would not be called with the correct context, leading to errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the `denodeify` method would be called with the incorrect context, leading to errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `denodeify` method would not be called with any context, leading to errors.

DONE.
