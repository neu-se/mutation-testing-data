 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment resolves the promise with the original values from the input promises, while this change resolves the promise with a null value, which might not be the expected behavior in the calling code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject
