  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject` creates a new rejected promise with the provided reason, whereas `Q` is a promise library that provides a way to create and manage promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw reason
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is a statement that throws an exception, whereas `Promise.reject` creates a new rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a method provided by the `Q` promise library that creates a new rejected promise with the provided reason.

DONE.
