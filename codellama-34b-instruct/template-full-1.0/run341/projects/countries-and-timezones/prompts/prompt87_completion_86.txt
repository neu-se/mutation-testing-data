  Here is the mutation testing with different options for the PLACEHOLDER:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountries();
```
This would result in different behavior because `getCountries()` returns a different set of countries than `getCountriesForTimezone()`, even though both functions access the same `data` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezones();
```
This would result in different behavior because `getTimezones()` returns a different set of timezones than `getCountriesForTimezone()`, even though both functions access the same `data` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountriesUsingTimezone();
```
This would result in different behavior because `getCountriesUsingTimezone()` returns a different set of countries than `getCountriesForTimezone()`, even though both functions access the same `data` object.

DONE.
