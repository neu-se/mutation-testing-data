  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|index|corpus/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the new fragment includes the word "corpus," which is not present in the original fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|index|[^aeiou]y/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the new fragment includes a negated character class, which would match any character that is not a vowel.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|index|[^aeiou]y|[^aeiou]ies/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the new fragment includes an additional alternation that matches the word "ies" after a consonant.

DONE.
