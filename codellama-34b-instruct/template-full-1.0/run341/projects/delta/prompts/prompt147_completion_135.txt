  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `OpIterator` to advance to the next element, even if the current element is not being filtered out.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(end - start)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by a fixed amount, rather than by the current element's length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(Math.min(end - start, thisIter.peekLength()))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by the minimum of the distance to the end of the range and the current element's length, rather than by the current element's length alone.

DONE.
