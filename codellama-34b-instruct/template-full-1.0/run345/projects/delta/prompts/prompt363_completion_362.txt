  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!otherIter.hasNext || thisIter.peekLength() !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would transform the iterator's behavior when there are no more elements to iterate, and the iterator is not empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!otherIter.hasNext && thisIter.peekLength() === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would transform the iterator's behavior when there are no more elements to iterate, and the iterator is empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.hasNext() && otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would transform the iterator's behavior when there are still elements to iterate, but the other iterator is not empty.

DONE.
