  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__maximumStackCounter__"
```
This would result in different behavior because `__maximumStackCounter__` is not a property of the `Error` object, while `__minimumStackCounter__` is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__stackCounter__"
```
This would result in different behavior because `__stackCounter__` is not a property of the `Error` object, while `__minimumStackCounter__` is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__counter__"
```
This would result in different behavior because `__counter__` is not a property of the `Error` object, while `__minimumStackCounter__` is.

DONE.
