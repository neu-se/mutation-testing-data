  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep)\b/i, function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the original word followed by an 's', which would result in incorrect pluralization for words that do not follow the regular pattern of adding an 's' to the end of the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep)\b/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the original word followed by an 'es', which would result in incorrect pluralization for words that do not follow the regular pattern of adding an 's' to the end of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
