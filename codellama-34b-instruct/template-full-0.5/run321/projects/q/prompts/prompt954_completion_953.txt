  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise with a value of `undefined`, whereas `deferred.reject` would reject the promise with a value of `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` would notify the promise with a value of `undefined`, whereas `deferred.reject` would reject the promise with a value of `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` would be returned as the value of the promise, whereas `deferred.reject` would reject the promise with a value of `undefined`.

DONE.
