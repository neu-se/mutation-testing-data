  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` will always reject the promise, regardless of the outcome of the `dispatch` method. In contrast, `Q` will resolve the promise if the `dispatch` method is successful, and reject it if it fails.
