  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `z` is infinite, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNaN']
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `z` is not a number (NaN), which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isFinite']
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `z` is finite, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

DONE.
