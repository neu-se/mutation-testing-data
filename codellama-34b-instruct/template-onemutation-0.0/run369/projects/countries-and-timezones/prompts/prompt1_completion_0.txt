  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!tzMap
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tzMap` variable is used to determine the current and all timezones for a country, and if it is falsy, the function returns null. By replacing the `!name` check with `!tzMap`, the function will return null if the `tzMap` is falsy, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
