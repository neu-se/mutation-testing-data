  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `array_slice(arguments)` which includes the first argument, but the new code fragment uses `array_slice(arguments, 1)` which excludes the first argument.

DONE.
