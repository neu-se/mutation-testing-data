  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekLength()` would return the length of the next operation in the `other` iterator, whereas `thisIter.peekLength()` would return the length of the next operation in the `this` iterator. Using `otherIter.peekLength()` would cause the `diff()` function to compare the lengths of the operations in the `this` and `other` iterators, which would result in a different output.

DONE.
