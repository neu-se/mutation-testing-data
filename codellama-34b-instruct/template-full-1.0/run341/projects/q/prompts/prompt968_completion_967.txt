  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 1, args
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the final argument to `Q.denodeify.apply` would be `1` instead of `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, args
```
This would result in different behavior because the number of arguments to `Q.denodeify.apply` would be 1 instead of 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.shift(), args
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument to `Q.denodeify.apply` would be removed from the `args` array instead of `undefined`.

DONE.
