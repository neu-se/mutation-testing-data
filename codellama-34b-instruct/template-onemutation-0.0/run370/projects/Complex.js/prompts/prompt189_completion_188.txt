  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is equal to 0, while the new code fragment checks if `a` is not equal to 0. This change in behavior would cause the code to take a different path, potentially leading to different results.

DONE.
