  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b['r']
```
This would result in different behavior because `b['r']` is not defined, resulting in a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['z']
```
This would result in different behavior because `a['z']` is not defined, resulting in a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.r
```
This would result in different behavior because `a.r` is not defined, resulting in a runtime error.

Now, replace the PLACEHOLDER with the correct code fragment, and replace
"<brief explanation>" with an explanation of the behavior difference.
