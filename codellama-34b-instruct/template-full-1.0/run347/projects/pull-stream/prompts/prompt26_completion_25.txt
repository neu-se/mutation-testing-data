  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3])

This would result in different behavior because it would always return the result of `pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3])` instead of the result of `pull.apply(null, ref)` when `length` is larger than 4.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
