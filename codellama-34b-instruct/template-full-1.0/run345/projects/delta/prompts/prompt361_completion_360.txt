  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!thisIter.empty()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the iterator has any element left, whereas `thisIter.hasNext()` only checks if the iterator has a next element but does not consume it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next() == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the next element is null, whereas `thisIter.hasNext()` only checks if there is a next element but does not consume it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek() == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the peeked element is null, whereas `thisIter.hasNext()` only checks if there is a next element but does not consume it.

DONE.
