  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester.test()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tester.test()` function is not defined in the original code, and therefore would cause a runtime error if called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester.test(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tester.test()` function is called with an argument, which would cause the function to behave differently than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester.test(test)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tester.test()` function is called with the `test` variable, which would cause the function to behave differently than the original code.

DONE.
