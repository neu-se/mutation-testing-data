Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url, currentUrl.text
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the second element of the map from the entire `currentUrl` object to just the `text` property of `currentUrl`, potentially losing important information about the URL structure.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the value in the map to `null` instead of the `currentUrl` object, which means that all information about the URL is lost, and the map will not contain any useful data for further processing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url, { url: currentUrl.url }
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps the `currentUrl.url` in an object with a single property `url`, which changes the structure of the stored value in the map, potentially affecting how the data is accessed later in the code.

DONE.
