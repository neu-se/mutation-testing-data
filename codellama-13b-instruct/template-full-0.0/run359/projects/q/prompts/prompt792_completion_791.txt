  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `void 0` operator would cause the `rejected` function to be called with no arguments, whereas the original code fragment would call it with the `err` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function would be called with no arguments, whereas the original code fragment would call it with the `err` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `void 0` operator would cause the `rejected` function to be called with no arguments, whereas the original code fragment would call it with the `err` argument.

DONE.
