  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `if(!thisIter.hasNext())`.
This would result in different behavior because it always evaluates to `false` while `iter.hasNext()` evaluates to `true` when there are still objects to iterate over, so the loop will never end.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `if(iter.peek().hasOwnProperty('retain'))`.
This would result in different behavior because it always evaluates to `true` while `iter.hasNext()` evaluates to `false` when there are no more objects to iterate over, so the loop will never end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `iter.hasNext() > 0`.
This would result in different behavior because it always evaluates to `false` while `iter.hasNext()` evaluates to `true` when there are still objects to iterate over, so the loop will never end.

DONE.
