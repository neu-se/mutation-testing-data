Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!thisOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the condition, causing the code to continue when `thisOp.delete` is falsy, which may lead to incorrect handling of operations that should be processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the presence of a `retain` property instead of `delete`, which could lead to operations being processed incorrectly when they should be ignored.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the presence of an `insert` property instead of `delete`, which would cause the logic to incorrectly handle insert operations as if they were delete operations.

DONE.
