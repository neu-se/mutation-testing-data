  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1/2 + x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the identity `cosh(x) = (e^x + e^-x) / 2`, which is true for all x, while the new code fragment uses `1/2 + x`, which is only true for specific values of x.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the identity `cosh(x) = (e^x + e^-x) / 2`, which is true for all x, while the new code fragment uses `2 * x`, which is only true for odd values of x.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e^x - x^2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the identity `cosh(x) = (e^x + e^-x) / 2`, which is true for all x,
