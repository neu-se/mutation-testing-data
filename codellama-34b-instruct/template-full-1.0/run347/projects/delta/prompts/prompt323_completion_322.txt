  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `baseIndex` to keep track of the current index in the `base` delta, whereas this modified code would always be one index ahead. This would cause the `slice` method to return incorrect results, which would in turn lead to incorrect results from the `invert` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `baseIndex` to keep track of the current index in the `base` delta, whereas this modified code would always double the current index. This would cause the `slice` method to return incorrect results, which would in turn lead to incorrect results from the `invert` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + Math.floor(Math.random() * 10)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `baseIndex` to keep track
