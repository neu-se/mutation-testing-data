  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!tzs[key].deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include timezones that are deprecated instead of excluding them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!tzs[key].deprecated || tzs[key].deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include all timezones, regardless of whether they are deprecated or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an empty object, even if there were deprecated timezones that should have been included.

DONE.
