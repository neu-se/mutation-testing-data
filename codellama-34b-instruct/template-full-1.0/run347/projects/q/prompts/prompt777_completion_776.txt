  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect.value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of `promise.inspect` instead of the promise's current state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise["inspect"]()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` method on `promise` instead of returning its state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the promise's current value instead of its state.

DONE.
