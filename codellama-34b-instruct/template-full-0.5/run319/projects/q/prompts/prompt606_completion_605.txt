  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would reject the promise instead of resolving it, which could cause the promise chain to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` would notify the promise of progress instead of resolving it, which could cause the promise chain to continue without being resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve(null)` would resolve the promise with a null value instead of the expected value, which could cause the promise chain to fail.

DONE.
