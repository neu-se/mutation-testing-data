 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve(object).delay
```
This would result in different behavior because it always wraps the object in a resolved promise before delaying, unlike the original code which may or may not receive a promise depending on the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.delay.call(Q, object)
