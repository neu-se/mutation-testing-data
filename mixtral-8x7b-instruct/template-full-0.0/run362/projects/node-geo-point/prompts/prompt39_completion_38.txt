 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cos(point1Rad) * Math.cos(point2Rad) * Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces randomness in the calculation of `b`, which can lead to different distances being calculated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cos(point2Rad) * Math.cos(point1Rad) * Math.sin(point1Rad) * Math.sin(point2Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the order of `point1Rad` and `point2Rad` in the calculation of `c`, which can lead to different distances being calculated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin(point1Rad + point2Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the sum of `point1Rad` and `point2Rad` instead of multiplying them, which can lead to different distances being calculated
