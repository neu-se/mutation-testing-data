  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.chop(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `chop` method is called with an argument of 1, which would cause the last operation in the delta to be removed, potentially altering the behavior of the `compose` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.chop(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `chop` method is called with an argument of 2, which would cause the last two operations in the delta to be removed, potentially altering the behavior of the `compose` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.chop(3)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `chop` method is called with an argument of 3, which would cause the last three operations in the delta to be removed, potentially altering the behavior of the `compose` method.

DONE.
