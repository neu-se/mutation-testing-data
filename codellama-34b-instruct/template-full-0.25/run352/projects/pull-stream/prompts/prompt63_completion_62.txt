  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = !abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the value of `abort`, causing the `end` variable to be set to the opposite of what it would be in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` variable would be assigned to `end`, rather than `end` being set to `abort` or `true` as in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = true
```
This would result in different behavior because `end` would always be set to `true`, regardless of the value of `abort`.

DONE.
