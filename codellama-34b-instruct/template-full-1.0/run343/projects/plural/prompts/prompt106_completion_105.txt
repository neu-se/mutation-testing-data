  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/^(bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep)$/i, function(w) { return w.toUpperCase() })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is case-insensitive, while the modified code fragment is case-sensitive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/^(bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep)$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the word ends with 's', while the modified code fragment always adds 's' to the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/^(bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep)$/i, function(w) { return w.length <
