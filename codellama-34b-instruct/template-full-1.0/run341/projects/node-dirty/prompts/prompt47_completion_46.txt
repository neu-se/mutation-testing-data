  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(key, undefined, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.set(key, undefined, cb)` is a recursive call that will continue to execute until the call stack overflows, while the original code `cb` would simply invoke the callback function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb` is a callback function that will be invoked with the updated value, while `this.set(key, undefined, cb)` would only set the value and not invoke the callback function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (cb) cb();
```
This would result in different behavior because `if (cb) cb();` checks if the callback function is defined before invoking it, while `this.set(key, undefined, cb)` would unconditionally set the value and invoke the callback function regardless of whether it is defined or not.

DONE.
