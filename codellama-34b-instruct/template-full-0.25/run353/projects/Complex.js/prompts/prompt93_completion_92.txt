  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 1 || isNaN(c)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the sum of `plus` and `minus` is equal to 0, while the new code fragment checks if it is equal to 1. This would cause the code to behave differently in certain cases where the sum of `plus` and `minus` is not equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 0 && isNaN(c)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the sum of `plus` and `minus` is equal to 0, while the new code fragment checks if it is equal to 0 and `c` is NaN. This would cause the code to behave differently in certain cases where the sum of `plus` and `minus` is not equal to 0, or where `c` is not NaN.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
