  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect` is a function and needs to be called to return the value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.inspect.value
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect` is a function and `value` is a property, so this would return the value of the `value` property instead of the return value of the `inspect` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.inspect.call(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a function that calls the `inspect` function with the `value` object as the context, so it would return the value of the `inspect` function called with the `value` object as the context.

DONE.
