 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would not receive a fulfillment handler, and the returned promise would be immediately resolved with the value `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty function would be passed as the fulfillment handler, and the returned promise would be resolved with `undefined` once the original promise is fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
42
```
This would result in different behavior because an integer would be passed instead of a function, causing a `TypeError` to be thrown when trying to call the integer as a function.

DONE.
