  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the boolean value of `resolvedPromise`, so if `resolvedPromise` is truthy, `!resolvedPromise` would be falsy, and vice versa. This would cause the `if` statement to behave differently, potentially leading to different execution paths.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `resolvedPromise` is equal to `undefined`, which is not the same as checking if it is truthy or falsy. This could cause the `if` statement to behave differently, potentially leading to different execution paths.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `resolvedPromise` is not equal to `undefined`, which is not the same as checking if it is truth
