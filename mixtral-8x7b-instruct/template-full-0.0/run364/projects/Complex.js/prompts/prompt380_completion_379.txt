 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```python
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the input `b` to calculate the result, while this change would always use the value `1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['im'] * 2
