  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key of object
```
This change will cause the code to iterate over the keys of the object instead of the values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key in object.keys()
```
This change will cause the code to iterate over the keys of the object, but using the `keys()` method instead of the `in` operator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key = Object.keys(object)[0]
```
This change will cause the code to iterate over the first key of the object, instead of all the keys.

DONE.
