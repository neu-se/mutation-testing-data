  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the wrong key to the `get` method, potentially causing the promise to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
["key"]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a string instead of a variable, potentially causing the promise to be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `undefined` instead of a valid key, potentially causing the promise to be rejected.

DONE.
