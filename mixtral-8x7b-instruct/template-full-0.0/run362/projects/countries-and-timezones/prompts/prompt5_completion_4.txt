 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => buildTimezonesMap(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new function expression, which may not have access to the same external variables or closures as the original `buildTimezonesMap` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezonesMap.bind(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new function with a fixed `this` value and pre-specified arguments, which may not behave the same way as the original `buildTimezonesMap` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezonesMap = {};
```
This would result in different behavior because it initializes `timezonesMap` to an empty object, rather than calling `buildTimezonesMap` to initialize it. This could cause the `buildCountry` function to return incorrect or incomplete data.

DONE.
