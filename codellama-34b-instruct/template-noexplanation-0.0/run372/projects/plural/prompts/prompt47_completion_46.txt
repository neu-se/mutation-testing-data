  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it adds an extra "es" to the end of the word, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 'ies' }
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it adds an extra "ies" to the end of the word, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 's' + 'es' }
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it adds an extra "s" and "es" to the end of the word, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
