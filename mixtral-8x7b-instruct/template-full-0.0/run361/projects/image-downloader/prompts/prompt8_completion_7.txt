 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.extname(options.dest) === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the filename has no extension, instead of checking if it has an extension.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.includes('.') === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the dest string contains a dot (any character), instead of checking if it has a file extension.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!options.dest.endsWith('.jpg')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the dest string does not end with '.jpg', instead of checking if it has any file extension.

DONE.
