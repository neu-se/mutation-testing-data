  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.push(part.slice(1))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the entire part string, including the colon, to the props array, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.push(part.slice(2))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the part string, starting from the second character, to the props array, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.push(part.split(':')[1])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the second part of the part string, separated by the colon, to the props array, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
