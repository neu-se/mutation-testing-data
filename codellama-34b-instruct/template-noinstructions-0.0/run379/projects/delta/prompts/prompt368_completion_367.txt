  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekType` is a function that returns the type of the next operation in the iterator, while `otherIter.peekType()` is a function call that returns the result of the function, which is the type of the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekType(1)` is a function call that returns the type of the next operation, but with an offset of 1. This means that the function will return the type of the operation that is one position ahead of the current position in the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekType(0)` is a function call that returns the type of the current operation, but with an offset
