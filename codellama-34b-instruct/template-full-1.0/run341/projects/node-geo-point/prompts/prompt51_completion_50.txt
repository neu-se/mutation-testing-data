  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude - point1.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the latitude of `point2` instead of the longitude, which would lead to an incorrect calculation of the angle between the points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude + point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the longitudes of the two points instead of subtracting them, which would lead to a different calculation of the angle between the points.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.latitude - point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the latitude of `point2` instead of the longitude, which would lead to an incorrect calculation of the angle between the points.

DONE.
