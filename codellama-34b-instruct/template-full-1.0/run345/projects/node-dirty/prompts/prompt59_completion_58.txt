  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `this.once('drain', () => this.close(this.path))`
This would result in different behavior because the PLACEHOLDER is intended to call the `close` method with no arguments, but this code fragment would call it with the `this.path` argument, which could change the behavior of the `close` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `this.once('drain', () => this._writeStream.end())`
This would result in different behavior because the PLACEHOLDER is intended to call the `close` method, but this code fragment would call the `end` method on the `_writeStream` object, which could change the behavior of the `close` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `this.once('drain', () => this._data.size = 0)`
This would result in different behavior because the PLACEHOLDER is intended to call the `close` method, but this code fragment would set the `size` property
