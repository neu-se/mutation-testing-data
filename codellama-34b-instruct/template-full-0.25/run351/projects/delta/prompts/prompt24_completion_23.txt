  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the value to be incremented by 1, which would change the result of the comparison.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key] - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the value to be decremented by 1, which would also change the result of the comparison.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the value to be multiplied by 2, which would change the result of the comparison.

DONE.
