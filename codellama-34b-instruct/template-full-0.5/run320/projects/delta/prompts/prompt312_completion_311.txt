  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, {}, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` variable is used to keep track of the current index in the `eachLine` method, and replacing it with `0` would cause the method to always return the first line in the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, {}, -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` variable is used to keep track of the current index in the `eachLine` method, and replacing it with `-1` would cause the method to always return the last line in the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, {}, Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` variable is used to keep track of the current index in the `eachLine` method, and replacing it with a random number would cause the method to return a random line in the delta.

DONE.
