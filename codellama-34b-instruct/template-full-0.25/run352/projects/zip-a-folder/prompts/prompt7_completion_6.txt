  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `targetFilePath` variable as a string, while the mutated code would use the uppercase version of the string. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently if the `targetFilePath` variable contains any lowercase characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `targetFilePath` variable as a string, while the mutated code would use the length of the string. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently if the `targetFilePath` variable contains any characters that are not part of the ASCII character set.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath.split('/')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `targetFilePath` variable as a string, while the mutated code would use the first part of the string
