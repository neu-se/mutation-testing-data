  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback && typeof callback.apply === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the callback is defined and has an `apply` method, which is not the case in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback && typeof callback.call === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the callback is defined and has a `call` method, which is not the case in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback && typeof callback.bind === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the callback is defined and has a `bind` method, which is not the case in the original code.

DONE.
