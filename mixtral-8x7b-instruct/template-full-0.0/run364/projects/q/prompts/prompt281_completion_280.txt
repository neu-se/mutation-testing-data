 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the resolver function would now receive an array as the first argument instead of individual arguments, causing the `array_slice` method to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the resolver function would receive `null` as the first argument, causing the `array_slice` method to throw a type error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ value: 'foo' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the resolver function would receive an object as the first argument, causing the `array_slice` method to throw a type error.

DONE.
