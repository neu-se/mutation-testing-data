Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the current promise object instead of the arguments array, leading to incorrect behavior when calling the Node function, as it would not receive the expected parameters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an empty array instead of the actual arguments, causing the Node function to be called without any parameters, which may lead to unexpected results or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` instead of the arguments array, which could cause the Node function to fail or behave incorrectly, as it would not receive the necessary arguments for execution.

DONE.
