  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.replace
```
This would result in different behavior because `replace` and `split` are different string methods with different purposes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` and `split` have different return values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` and `split` have different return values.

DONE.
