  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `id` variable is being incremented by 1, which would cause the `buildCountry` function to return a different country object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `id` variable is being decremented by 1, which would cause the `buildCountry` function to return a different country object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `id` variable is being multiplied by 2, which would cause the `buildCountry` function to return a different country object.

DONE.
