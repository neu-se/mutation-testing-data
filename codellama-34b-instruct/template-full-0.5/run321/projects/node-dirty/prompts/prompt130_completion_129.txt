  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, cbs] = this._queue.shift();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the original code by changing the order of the assignments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, cbs] = [this._queue.shift(), []];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the original code by assigning an empty array to `cbs` instead of using the existing `cbs` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, cbs] = [this._queue.shift(), this._queue.shift()];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the original code by assigning the result of `this._queue.shift()` to both `key` and `cbs`, which would cause the code to behave differently when the queue is empty.

DONE.
