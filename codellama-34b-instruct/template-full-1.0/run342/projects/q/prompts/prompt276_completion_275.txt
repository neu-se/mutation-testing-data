  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("An error occurred.");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would explicitly throw an error, rather than allowing the error to be thrown by the `reject` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject("An error occurred.");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a string as an argument to the `reject` method, rather than passing an `Error` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(new Error("An error occurred."));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new `Error` object with a different message than the original code fragment.

DONE.
