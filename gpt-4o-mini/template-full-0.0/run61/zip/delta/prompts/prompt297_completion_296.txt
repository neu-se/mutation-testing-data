Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, iter.peek().attributes || {}, i) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `iter.peek()` instead of `iter.next(1)`, which means it checks the attributes of the current operation without advancing the iterator, potentially leading to different results in subsequent iterations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, {}, i + 1) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it increments the index `i` by 1, which changes the line number passed to the predicate, potentially affecting the logic that depends on the line index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, iter.next(1).attributes || { key: 'value' }, i) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it provides a default object `{ key: 'value' }` for attributes if they are not present, which could alter the outcome of the predicate evaluation compared to using an empty object or the actual attributes.

DONE.
