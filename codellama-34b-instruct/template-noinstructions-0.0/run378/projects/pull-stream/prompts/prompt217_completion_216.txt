  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that is called with the arguments `err` and `data`, while `null` is not a function and would result in a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that is called with the arguments `err` and `data`, while `undefined` is not a function and would result in a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that is called with the arguments `err` and `data`, while the new function `function () {}` is a no-op and would not call the `cb` function with the expected arguments.

DONE.
