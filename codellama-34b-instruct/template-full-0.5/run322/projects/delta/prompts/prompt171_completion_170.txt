  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.max` returns the largest value, whereas `Math.min` returns the smallest value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the next value after the length, rather than the smallest value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the previous value before the length, rather than the smallest value.

DONE.
