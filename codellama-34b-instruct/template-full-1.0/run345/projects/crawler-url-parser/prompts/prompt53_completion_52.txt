  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl, parsedBaseUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments in URL.resolve() is reversed, causing the resolved URL to be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl.path, parsedUrl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because the path properties of the two URLs are swapped, causing the resolved URL to be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.hostname, parsedBaseUrl.hostname
```
This would result in different behavior because the hostnames of the two URLs are swapped, causing the resolved URL to be different.

DONE.
