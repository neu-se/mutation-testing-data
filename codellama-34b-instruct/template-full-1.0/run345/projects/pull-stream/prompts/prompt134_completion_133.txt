  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `true` would always pass the input to the callback, while the new fragment `false` would always fail the input and result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `true` would always pass the input to the callback, while the new fragment `null` would always fail the input and result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `true` would always pass the input to the callback, while the new fragment `undefined` would always fail the input and result in an error.

DONE.
