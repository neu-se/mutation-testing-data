  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is different, it matches a different part of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "").trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trim()` method is added, which removes whitespace from the beginning and end of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "") + "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string "foo" is added to the end of the string.

DONE.
