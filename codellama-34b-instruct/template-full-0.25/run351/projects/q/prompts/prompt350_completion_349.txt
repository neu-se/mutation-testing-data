  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.promiseDispatch(function (value) {
    if (done) {
        return;
    }
    done = true;

    deferred.resolve(_fulfilled(value));
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` method is not defined on the `self` object, so it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.promiseDispatch(function (value) {
    if (done) {
        return;
    }
    done = true;

    deferred.resolve(_fulfilled(value));
}, "when", [function (exception) {
    if (done) {
        return;
    }
    done = true;

    deferred.resolve(_rejected(exception));
}]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` method is not defined on the `self` object, so it would throw an error.

Option 3
