  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the complex arcus sine function calculates the square root of `1 - i / c^2`, which is always non-negative, and this value is then passed to the `Math.acos()` function, which calculates the arcus cosine of the input value. However, if the input value is negative, the result of `Math.acos()` is not a well-defined real number, so the function will return `NaN`.

In contrast, if the PLACEHOLDER is replaced with `-b`, the square root of `1 - i / c^2` will be negative, and the arcus cosine of this value will be well-defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the complex arcus sine function calculates the square root of `1 - i / c^2`, which is always non-negative, and this value is
