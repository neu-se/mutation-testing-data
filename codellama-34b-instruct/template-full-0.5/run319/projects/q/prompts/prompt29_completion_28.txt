  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` removes the last element of the array, while `length` simply returns the length of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift()` removes the first element of the array, while `length` simply returns the length of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a new array with the specified elements, while `length` simply returns the length of the array.

DONE.
