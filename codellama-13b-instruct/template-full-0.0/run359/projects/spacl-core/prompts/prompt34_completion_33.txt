  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().map(x => x.toUpperCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map()` method is used to convert each element of the array to uppercase, which would affect the resulting array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().filter(x => x.length > 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter()` method is used to remove any empty strings from the resulting array, which would affect the resulting array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().reduce((acc, x) => acc + x, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce()` method is used to concatenate all the elements of the array into a single string, which would affect the resulting string.

DONE.
