  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the callback function with `null` as both arguments, even if the data passed the test.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(data, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the callback function with the data as the first argument and `null` as the second argument, even if the data did not pass the test.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the callback function with `null` as the first argument and the data as the second argument, even if the data did not pass the test.

DONE.
