  Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with `'criterium', 'criteria'`.
This would result in different behavior because the `addRule` method would not recognize the word `criterion` and would therefore not apply the correct pluralization rule.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with `'criterion', 'criterion'`.
This would result in different behavior because the `addRule` method would recognize the word `criterion` and apply the wrong pluralization rule.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with `'criterionz', 'criterionz'`.
This would result in different behavior because the `addRule` method would not recognize the word `criterionz` and would therefore not apply any pluralization rule.

DONE.
