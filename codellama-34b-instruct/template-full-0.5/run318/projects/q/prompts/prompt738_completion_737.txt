  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` would always return a rejected promise, whereas `Q.resolve` would always return a resolved promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer` would create a new deferred object, whereas `Q.resolve` would return a resolved promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when` would return a promise that is resolved or rejected based on the state of the input promise, whereas `Q.resolve` would always return a resolved promise.

DONE.
