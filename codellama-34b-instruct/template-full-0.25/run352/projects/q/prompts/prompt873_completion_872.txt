  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, but replacing it with `null` would result in a different value being passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, but replacing it with `undefined` would result in a different value being passed to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, but replacing it with an empty function would result in a different function being called.

DONE.
