  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp === Delta.default
```
This would result in different behavior because the default comparison operator is !==, which checks if the two objects are not the same, and the === operator checks if they are the same.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp == Delta.default
```
This would result in different behavior because the == operator checks if the two objects are equal, which is different from the !== operator used in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp !== Delta.default
```
This would result in different behavior because the !== operator checks if the two objects are not the same, and the === operator checks if they are the same.

DONE.
