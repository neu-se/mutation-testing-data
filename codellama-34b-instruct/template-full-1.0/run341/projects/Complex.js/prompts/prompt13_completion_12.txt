  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b < x && x > b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used a double negative operator `-` to check if the opposite of the condition was true, but the replacement code fragment uses a single positive operator `<` to check if the condition is true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x >= b || -b < x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used a double negative operator `-` to check if the opposite of the condition was true, but the replacement code fragment uses a single positive operator `>` to check if the condition is true. Additionally, the replacement code fragment uses a logical OR operator `||` to check if either of the conditions is true, while the original code fragment used a logical AND operator `&&` to check if both conditions were true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x <= b && -b > x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used a double negative
