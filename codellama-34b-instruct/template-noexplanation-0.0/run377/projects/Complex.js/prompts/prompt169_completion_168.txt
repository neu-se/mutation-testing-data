  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This change will cause the `div` function to return `Complex['ZERO']` when the divisor is zero and the dividend is infinite, which is incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || z['isZero']()
```
This change will cause the `div` function to return `Complex['INFINITY']` when the divisor is zero and the dividend is infinite, which is incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isZero']()
```
This change will cause the `div` function to return `Complex['NAN']` when the divisor is zero and the dividend is infinite, which is incorrect.

DONE.
