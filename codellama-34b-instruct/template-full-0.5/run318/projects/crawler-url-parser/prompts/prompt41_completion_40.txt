  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(baseUrlStr, false, true);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the second argument of the `parse` method from `true` to `false`, which would cause the method to not remove the query string from the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(baseUrlStr, true, false);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the third argument of the `parse` method from `true` to `false`, which would cause the method to not remove the fragment from the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(baseUrlStr, false, false);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change both the second and third arguments of the `parse` method from `true` to `false`, which would cause the method to not remove the query string or fragment from the URL.

DONE.
