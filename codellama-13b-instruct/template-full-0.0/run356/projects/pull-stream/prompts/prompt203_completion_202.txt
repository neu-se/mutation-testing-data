  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator will always return `true` if the first operand is truthy, regardless of the value of `end`. This means that the `if` statement will always evaluate to `true`, and the `cb` function will always be called, regardless of whether `end` is truthy or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator will always return `true` if the first operand is truthy, regardless of the value of `end`. This means that the `if` statement will always evaluate to `true`, and the `cb` function will always be called, regardless of whether `end` is truthy or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end == true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `==` operator will compare the value of `end` to the value of `true`,
