  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{key, val: this._data.get(key)}

This would result in different behavior because the `val` property would always be `undefined`, as the `get` method is not being called with the correct key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{key, val: this._data.get(key)}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `val` property would always be `undefined`, as the `get` method is not being called with the correct key.
