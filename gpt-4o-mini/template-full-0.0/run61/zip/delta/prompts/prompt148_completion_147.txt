Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the `nextOp` to always take a length of 1, which may not accurately reflect the actual length of the operation being processed, potentially leading to incorrect composition of operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nextOp` to always take a length of 0, effectively skipping the operation entirely, which could lead to loss of data in the composed delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it increases the length by 1, which may cause the composition to include an extra character or operation that does not exist, leading to an incorrect representation of the composed delta.

DONE.
