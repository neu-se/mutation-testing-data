  Option 1:
```
deg2radÂ²
```
This would result in different behavior because it would square the value
returned by `deg2rad`, which would produce a much larger value and could
potentially cause the `calculateDestination` function to produce incorrect
results.

Option 2:
```
rad2deg()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the degree
equivalent of the radian angle, rather than the radian angle itself. This could
cause the `calculateDestination` function to produce incorrect results.

Option 3:
```
deg2rad*2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the value
returned by `deg2rad` by 2, which would increase the angle and could potentially
cause the `calculateDestination` function to produce incorrect results.

DONE.
