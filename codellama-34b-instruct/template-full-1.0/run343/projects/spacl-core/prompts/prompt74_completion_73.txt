  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `res === false`, which is a strict equality check that checks if `res` is exactly equal to the boolean value `false`. The buggy code fragment uses the inequality operator `!==`, which checks if `res` is not exactly equal to the boolean value `false`. This means that the buggy code fragment will consider any value that is not strictly equal to `false` as if it were equivalent to `true`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(res === false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `res === false`, which is a strict equality check that checks if `res` is exactly equal to the boolean value `false`. The buggy code fragment uses the `!` operator to negate the result of the equality check, which means that it will consider any value that is not strictly equal to `false` as if it were equivalent to `true`. This is incorrect because it
