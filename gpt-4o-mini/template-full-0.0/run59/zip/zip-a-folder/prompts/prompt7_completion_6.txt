Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the source path with itself, which would always be true, leading to the error "Source and target folder must be different." being thrown incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `path.dirname` function to return the directory of the current working directory instead of the target file path, potentially leading to incorrect permission checks and file access errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'./dummyPath'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always compare the target base path to a fixed string, which would never match the source path, thus preventing the error from being thrown even if the source and target are the same.

DONE.
