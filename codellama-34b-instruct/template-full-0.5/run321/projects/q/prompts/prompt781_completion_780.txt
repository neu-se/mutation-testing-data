  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Q can't get fulfillment value from any promise, all promises were rejected. Last error message: " + rejection.message);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws an error if all promises are rejected, while this new code fragment throws an error for any rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection.message = ("Q can't get fulfillment value from any promise, all promises were rejected. Last error message: " + rejection.message);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws an error if all promises are rejected, while this new code fragment sets the rejection message for any rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(rejection);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws an error if all promises are rejected, while this new code fragment rejects the deferred promise for any rejected
