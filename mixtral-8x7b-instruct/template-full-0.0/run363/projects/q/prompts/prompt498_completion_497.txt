 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trackRejection` function expects two arguments, but only one will be provided. This could cause unexpected behavior or errors in the `trackRejection` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trackRejection` function expects a promise as the first argument, but it will receive an array instead. This could cause unexpected behavior or errors in the `trackRejection` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
rejection(reason)
