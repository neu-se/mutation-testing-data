  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
gettype(linkurl, pageurl)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gettype` function is not defined in the provided code snippet, so it would throw a `ReferenceError` when called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
gettype(linkurl, pageurl, "internal")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gettype` function is not defined in the provided code snippet, so it would throw a `ReferenceError` when called. Additionally, the third argument `"internal"` is not defined in the function signature, so it would also throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
gettype(linkurl, pageurl, "external")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gettype` function is not defined in the provided code snippet, so it would throw a `ReferenceError` when called. Additionally, the third argument `"external"` is not defined in the function signature, so it would also throw
