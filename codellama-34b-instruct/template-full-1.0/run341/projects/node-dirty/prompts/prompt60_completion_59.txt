  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this._writeStream != null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `this._readStream` exists, whereas the suggested code checks if `this._writeStream` exists. This could potentially cause bugs if the code relies on the `this._writeStream` object to exist before proceeding.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this._queue.remove(key) === this._data.get(key))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checks if `this._queue.remove(key)` exists, whereas the suggested code checks if the value returned by `this._queue.remove(key)` is equal to the value of `this._data.get(key)`. This could potentially cause bugs if the code relies on the specific behavior of the `while` loop when there are duplicate keys in the queue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this._data.hasOwnProperty(
