Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'child'
```
This would result in different behavior because the plural of "child" is "children," which does not match the expected pluralization of "chilli" to "chillies."

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chill'
```
This would result in different behavior because the plural of "chill" would incorrectly be "chills," instead of the expected "chillies."

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cactus'
```
This would result in different behavior because "cactus" is handled by a specific rule that changes it to "cacti," which is different from the expected pluralization of "chilli" to "chillies."

DONE.
