  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const firstOther = otherIter.peek();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek()` method is not defined for the `otherIter` object, which is an instance of `OpIterator`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const firstOther = other.ops[0];
```
This would result in different behavior because the `firstOther` variable would be assigned the first operation in the `other` delta, rather than the first operation in the `otherIter` iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const firstOther = otherIter.next();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method would return the next operation in the `otherIter` iterator, rather than the first operation in the `other` delta.

DONE.
