 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek()` only returns the next element without advancing the iterator, so the `compose` method would end up in an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
otherIter.next.call(otherIter)
