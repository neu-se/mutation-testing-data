  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"values", []
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys` method returns an array of the own enumerable property names of an object, while the `values` method returns an array of the own enumerable property values of an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"length", []
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys` method returns an array of the own enumerable property names of an object, while the `length` property returns the number of elements in an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"concat", []
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys` method returns an array of the own enumerable property names of an object, while the `concat` method returns a new array that is the result of concatenating two or more arrays.

DONE.
