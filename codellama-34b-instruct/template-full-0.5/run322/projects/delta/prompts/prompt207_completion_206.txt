  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.delete` is a method that deletes the contents of `otherOp`, while `otherOp` is an object that contains the data to be inserted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.retain` is a method that retains the contents of `otherOp`, while `otherOp` is an object that contains the data to be inserted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.insert` is a method that inserts the contents of `otherOp`, while `otherOp` is an object that contains the data to be inserted.

DONE.
