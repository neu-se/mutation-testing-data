  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` returns a rejected promise, which would cause the `tap` method to be called with a rejected promise, rather than a fulfilled promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve()` returns a fulfilled promise, which would cause the `tap` method to be called with a fulfilled promise, rather than a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` returns a deferred promise, which would cause the `tap` method to be called with a deferred promise, rather than a fulfilled or rejected promise.

DONE.
