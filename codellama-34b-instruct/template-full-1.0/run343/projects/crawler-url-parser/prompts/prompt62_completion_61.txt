  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the path of the URL, which may not match the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the host of the URL, which may not match the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.port
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the port of the URL, which may not match the original code fragment.

DONE.
