 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```python
this.ops.splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` modifies the original array, while `slice` creates a new array. This could lead to unexpected changes in the original `ops` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` returns a new array, but does not modify the original `ops` array. This could lead to unexpected results if the code relies on the original `ops` array being modified.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, while `slice` simply returns a portion of the original array. This could lead to unexpected results if the code relies on the original `ops` array being modified.

DONE.
