  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement code checks for rejection instead of fulfillment. If the promise is fulfilled, the replacement code would not return the fulfilled value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.value === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement code checks if the inspected value is undefined instead of checking the state of the promise. If the promise is fulfilled, the replacement code would return the fulfilled value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected !== value
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement code checks if the inspected value is not equal to the promise value instead of checking the state of the promise. If the promise is fulfilled, the replacement code would return the fulfilled value.

Please conclude your response with "DONE."

DONE.
