  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "next")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `continuer` function is being bound to itself as the `this` context, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(null, "next")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `continuer` function is being bound to `null` as the `this` context, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {
    return continuer.call(null, "next");
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `continuer` function is being called with `null` as the `this` context, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
