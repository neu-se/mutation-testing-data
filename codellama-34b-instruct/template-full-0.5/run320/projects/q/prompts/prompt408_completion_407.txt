  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` checks if the value is a promise-like object, which is a broader category than `isPromise` and may include objects that are not instances of the `Promise` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isObject
```
This would result in different behavior because `isObject` checks if the value is an object, which is a broader category than `isPromise` and may include arrays, functions, and other non-promise objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFulfilled` checks if the promise is in the "fulfilled" state, which is different from the "pending" state that `isPromise` checks for.

DONE.
