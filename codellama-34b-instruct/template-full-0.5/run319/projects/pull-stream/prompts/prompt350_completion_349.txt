  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.foo
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.foo` is not a function, and `test.test(data)` assumes that `test` is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.foo
```
This would result in different behavior because `test.foo` is not a function, and `test.test(data)` assumes that `test` is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id.foo
```
This would result in different behavior because `id.foo` is not a function, and `test.test(data)` assumes that `test` is a function.

DONE.
