  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection", reason, promise.then(function() { throw reason; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error if the promise is fulfilled, whereas the original code does not throw an error if the promise is fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection", reason, promise.then(function() { return reason; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the reason if the promise is fulfilled, whereas the original code does not return anything if the promise is fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection", reason, promise.catch(function() { throw reason; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error if the promise is rejected, whereas the original code does not throw an error if the promise is rejected.

DONE.
