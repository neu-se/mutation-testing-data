  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt(a)` returns the square root of `a`, whereas `Math.sqrt(2 * (r - a))` returns the square root of `2 * (r - a)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt(b)` returns the square root of `b`, whereas `Math.sqrt(2 * (r - a))` returns the square root of `2 * (r - a)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt(a + b)` returns the square root of `a + b`, whereas `Math.sqrt(2 * (r - a))` returns the square root of `2 * (r - a)`.

DONE.
