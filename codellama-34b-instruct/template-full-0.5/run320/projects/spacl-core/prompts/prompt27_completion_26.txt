  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flatten(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flatten` function would be called with `false` as an argument, which would cause it to return a different value than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flatten(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flatten` function would be called with `true` as an argument, which would cause it to return a different value than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flatten(any)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flatten` function would be called with the value of the `any` variable as an argument, which could be any value.

DONE.
