  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('die', 'die')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a new rule to the list of rules, but this replacement code fragment would simply add a rule that returns the same word, effectively doing nothing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('die', 'dice')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a new rule to the list of rules, but this replacement code fragment would add a rule that returns a different word, effectively changing the behavior of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('die', 'dies')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a new rule to the list of rules, but this replacement code fragment would add a rule that returns a different word, effectively changing the behavior of the function.

DONE.
