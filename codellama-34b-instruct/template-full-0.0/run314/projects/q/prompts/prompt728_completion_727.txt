  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected instead of resolved, which would cause the `all` function to return a rejected promise instead of a fulfilled one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be notified instead of resolved or rejected, which would cause the `all` function to return a pending promise instead of a fulfilled one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(promises)
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with the `promises` array instead of the `values` array, which would cause the `all` function to return a promise that resolves to the `promises` array instead of the `values` array.

DONE.
