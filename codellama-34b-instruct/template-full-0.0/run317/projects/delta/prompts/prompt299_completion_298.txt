  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `line.length` is a number, while `line` is a string, and the `eachLine` method expects a string as its first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `line.toUpperCase()` would return a new string with all characters in uppercase, while `line` is a string with mixed case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `line.split('')` would return an array of single characters, while `line` is a string.

DONE.
