  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `eachLine` method would not iterate over the lines of the delta, and the `predicate` function would not be called for each line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `eachLine` method would iterate over the lines of the delta in reverse order, and the `predicate` function would be called for each line in reverse order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `eachLine` method would iterate over the lines of the delta twice, and the `predicate` function would be called for each line twice.

DONE.
