  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c, options, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional argument `1` would cause the `getCountry` function to return a different result, potentially causing the `getCountriesForTimezone` function to return an incorrect value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c, options, "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional argument `"foo"` would cause the `getCountry` function to return a different result, potentially causing the `getCountriesForTimezone` function to return an incorrect value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c, options, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional argument `null` would cause the `getCountry` function to return a different result, potentially causing the `getCountriesForTimezone` function to return an incorrect value.

DONE.
