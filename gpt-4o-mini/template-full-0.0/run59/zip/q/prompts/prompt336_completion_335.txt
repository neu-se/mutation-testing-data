Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the expected state from an object to a string, which would cause the promise to not correctly handle the fulfillment state, potentially leading to incorrect promise resolution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` would cause the `inspect` function to return an object with `state` as `unknown`, which may lead to unexpected behavior when checking the promise's state, especially in the context of error handling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` would cause the `inspect` function to not be called at all, leading to the promise not being able to determine its state, which could result in unhandled promise rejections or incorrect state reporting.

DONE.
