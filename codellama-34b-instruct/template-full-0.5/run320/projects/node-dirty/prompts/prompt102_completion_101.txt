  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code deletes the key from the data store, while this code sets the value of the key to `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code deletes the key from the data store, while this code sets the value of the key to `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, '');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code deletes the key from the data store, while this code sets the value of the key to an empty string.

DONE.
