  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would increase the argument of the `Math.pow` function, which would change the result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would decrease the argument of the `Math.pow` function, which would change the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] * z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would multiply the arguments of the `Math.pow` function, which would change the result.

DONE.
