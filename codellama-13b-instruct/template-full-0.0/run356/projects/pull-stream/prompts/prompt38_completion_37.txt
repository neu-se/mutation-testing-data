  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3], ref[4]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now be attempting to access an index that is out of bounds of the `ref` array, which would result in a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3], ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now be attempting to access the same index twice, which would result in a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3], ref[4], ref[5]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now be attempting to access an index that is out of bounds of the `ref` array, which would result in a runtime error.

DONE.
