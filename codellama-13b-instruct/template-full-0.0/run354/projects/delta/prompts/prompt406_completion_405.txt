  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would capitalize the `embedType` string, which could cause the `transform()` method to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would lowercase the `embedType` string, which could cause the `transform()` method to return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType.substring(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring()` method would return the first character of the `embedType` string, which could cause the `transform()` method to return incorrect results.

DONE.
