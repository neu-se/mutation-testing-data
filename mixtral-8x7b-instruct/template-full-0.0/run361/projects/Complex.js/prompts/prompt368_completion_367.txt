 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original expression would always evaluate to `NaN` when `b` is 0, while the mutated expression would throw a division-by-zero error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(b)
