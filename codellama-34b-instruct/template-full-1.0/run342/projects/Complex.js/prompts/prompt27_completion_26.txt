  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'Invalid parameter'
```
This would result in different behavior because the modified code would return a different string message when the parameter is invalid.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new SyntaxError('Invalid parameter');
```
This would result in different behavior because the modified code would throw a SyntaxError exception when the parameter is invalid, whereas the original code would return a string message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.warn('Invalid parameter');
```
This would result in different behavior because the modified code would log a warning message to the console when the parameter is invalid, whereas the original code would return a string message.

DONE.
