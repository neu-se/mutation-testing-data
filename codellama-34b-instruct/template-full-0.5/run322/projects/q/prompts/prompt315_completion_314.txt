  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fallback === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value and will always be false when compared to a function using the `===` operator, whereas `void 0` is a special value that represents "undefined" and will only be false when compared to `undefined` using the `===` operator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fallback === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value and will always be false when compared to a function using the `===` operator, whereas `void 0` is a special value that represents "undefined" and will only be false when compared to `undefined` using the `===` operator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fallback === function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because a new function is created each time the code is executed, whereas `void 0` is a special value that represents "undefined" and will always be false when
