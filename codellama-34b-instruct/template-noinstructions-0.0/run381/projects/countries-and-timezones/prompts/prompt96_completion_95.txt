  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.filter(Boolean).map
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter(Boolean)` would remove any falsy values from the `values` array, which could potentially change the behavior of the `map` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.map(value => value + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` function would add 1 to each value in the `values` array, which could potentially change the behavior of the `getTimezonesForCountry` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.map(value => value * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` function would multiply each value in the `values` array by 2, which could potentially change the behavior of the `getTimezonesForCountry` function.

DONE.
