  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `task` variable is not defined, and the `laterQueue.push(0)` statement would push the number 0 into the `laterQueue` array, rather than the `task` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `task` variable is not defined, and the `laterQueue.push(null)` statement would push the `null` value into the `laterQueue` array, rather than the `task` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `task` variable is not defined, and the `laterQueue.push(undefined)` statement would push the `undefined` value into the `laterQueue` array, rather than the `task` object.

DONE.
