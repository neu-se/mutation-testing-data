  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `err !== null` will always be true if `err` is not null, regardless of the length of `cbs`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbs.length > 0` will always be false if `cbs` is an empty array, regardless of the value of `err`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cbs.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `!cbs.length` will always be true if `cbs` is an empty array, regardless of the value of `err`.

DONE.
