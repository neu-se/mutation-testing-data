  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the first op in the slice, which is not included in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the third op in the slice, which is not included in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include only the second op in the slice, which is not included in the original code.

DONE.
