  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `a > 0` would always evaluate to `true` when `a` is a non-zero number, whereas the original `a === 0` would only evaluate to `true` when `a` is exactly equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `a !== 0` would always evaluate to `true` when `a` is not exactly equal to 0, whereas the original `a === 0` would only evaluate to `true` when `a` is exactly equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a !== a` would always evaluate to `true` regardless of the value of `a`, whereas the original `a === 0` would only evaluate to `true` when `a` is exactly equal to 0.
