  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.splice(0, 0, item)
```
This would result in different behavior because `arr.splice()` inserts an element at a specific index in the array, whereas `arr.push()` adds an element to the end of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.unshift(item)
```
This would result in different behavior because `arr.unshift()` adds an element to the beginning of the array, whereas `arr.push()` adds an element to the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `arr.pop()` removes and returns the last element of the array, whereas `arr.push()` adds an element to the end of the array.

DONE.
