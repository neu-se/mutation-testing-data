  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.delete(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete one character from the `retDelta` instead of chopping it, which could potentially lead to bugs in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.retain(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain one character from the `retDelta` instead of chopping it, which could potentially lead to bugs in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.compose(new Delta())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compose the `retDelta` with an empty Delta, which could potentially lead to bugs in the code.

DONE.
