  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[^aeiou]y$|quy$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/[^aeiou]y$|quy$/i` matches words that end with "y" or "quy", but the original code fragment only matches words that end with "y".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
