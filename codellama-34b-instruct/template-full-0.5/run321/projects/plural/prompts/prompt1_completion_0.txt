  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).slice(8, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment slices the string from the 8th character to the end, while this new code fragment slices the string from the 8th character to the 2nd character from the end.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).slice(1, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment slices the string from the 8th character to the end, while this new code fragment slices the string from the 2nd character to the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment slices the string from the 8th character to the end, while this new code fragment slices the string from the beginning
