  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first element of the array, potentially causing the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider the previous element of the array, potentially causing the test to pass.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider the second element of the array, potentially causing the test to fail.

DONE.
