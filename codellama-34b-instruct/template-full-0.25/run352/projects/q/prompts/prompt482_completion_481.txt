  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would not be called for the `promise` parameter, which could cause unhandled rejections to be tracked indefinitely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would be called with an invalid index, which could cause an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would be called with the length of the `unhandledReasons` array, which could cause the function to remove the wrong element from the array.

DONE.
