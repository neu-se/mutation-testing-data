  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^#.*$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only matches URLs that contain a fragment identifier (e.g. `#foo`), while the new code fragment matches URLs that start with a `#` character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is case-sensitive, while the new code fragment is case-insensitive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only matches the first occurrence of a fragment identifier, while the new code fragment matches all occurrences.

DONE.
