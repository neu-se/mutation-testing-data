  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a specific `this` context, which would be `null` in this case. This means that the `dispatch` method would be called on `null` instead of the `Promise` object, which would likely cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` calls a function with a specific `this` context and arguments, which would be `null` and `args` in this case. This means that the `dispatch` method would be called on `null` instead of the `Promise` object, which would likely cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.apply(null, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` calls a function with a specific `this` context and arguments, which would
