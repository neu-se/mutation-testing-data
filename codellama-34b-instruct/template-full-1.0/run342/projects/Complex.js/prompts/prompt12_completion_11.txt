  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x+1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function would return a different value than it would with the original `-x` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x*2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinh` function would return a different value than it would with the original `-x` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x+Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosm1` function would return a different value than it would with the original `-x` argument.

DONE.
