 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'constant_key'
```
This would result in different behavior because a hardcoded string as a key is used instead of the provided `key` variable, which may cause unintended data overwriting or inability to remove certain keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
