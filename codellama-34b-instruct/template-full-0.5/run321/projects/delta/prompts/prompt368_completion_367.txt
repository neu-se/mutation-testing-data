  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasNext()` returns a boolean indicating whether there are more operations to iterate over, while `peekType()` returns the type of the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `next()` returns the next operation and increments the iterator, while `peekType()` only returns the type of the next operation without incrementing the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek()` returns the next operation without incrementing the iterator, while `peekType()` only returns the type of the next operation without incrementing the iterator.

DONE.
