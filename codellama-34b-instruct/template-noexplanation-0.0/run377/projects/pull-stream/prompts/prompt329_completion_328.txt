  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + 1
```
This change will cause the `through` function to return a different value than the original code, which may cause issues in the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op - 1
```
This change will also cause the `through` function to return a different value than the original code, which may cause issues in the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op * 2
```
This change will cause the `through` function to return a different value than the original code, which may cause issues in the test suite.

DONE.
