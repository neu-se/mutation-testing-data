  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the substring used in the replacement string for the singular form of words ending in -us.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the substring used in the replacement string for the singular form of words ending in -us.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let x = w.length; x = w.length - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the substring used in the replacement string for the singular form of words ending in -us.

DONE.
