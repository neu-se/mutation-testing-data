  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin` has a different value than `cos` for the same input, which would cause the calculation of the bearing to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `tan` has a different value than `cos` for the same input, which would cause the calculation of the bearing to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `acos` has a different value than `cos` for the same input, which would cause the calculation of the bearing to be incorrect.

DONE.
