  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isStopIteration
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `continuer` function to always return `Q(result.value)`, even if the generator throws an exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isStopIteration
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `continuer` function to always return `Q(result.value)`, even if the generator throws an exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isStopIteration
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `continuer` function to always return `Q(result.value)`, even if the generator throws an exception.

DONE.
