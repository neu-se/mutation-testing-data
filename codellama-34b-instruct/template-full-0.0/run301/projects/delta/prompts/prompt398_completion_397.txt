  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.retain` is a different value than `otherOp`, which could cause the `transform` method to produce a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.delete` is a different value than `otherOp`, which could cause the `transform` method to produce a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.retain.length` is a different value than `otherOp`, which could cause the `transform` method to produce a different output.

DONE.
