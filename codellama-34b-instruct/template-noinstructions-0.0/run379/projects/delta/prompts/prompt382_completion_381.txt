  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to advance by `length` positions, potentially skipping over important operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to advance by an arbitrary amount, potentially skipping over important operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to advance by 0 positions, potentially skipping over important operations.

DONE.
