  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would run one extra iteration, potentially causing the code to crash or produce unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would not run at all, potentially causing the code to skip over important functionality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only run once, potentially causing the code to produce incorrect results.

DONE.
