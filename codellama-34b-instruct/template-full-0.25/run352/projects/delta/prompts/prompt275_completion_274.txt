  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength()` returns the length of the current op, while `peekType()` returns the type of the current op.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek()` returns the current op, while `peekType()` returns the type of the current op.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength()` returns the length of the current op, while `peekType()` returns the type of the current op.

DONE.
