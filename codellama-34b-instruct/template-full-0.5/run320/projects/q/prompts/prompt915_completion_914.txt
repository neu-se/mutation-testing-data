  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is a function that creates a new deferred object, while `undefined` is a primitive value that represents the absence of any object value. If the code were to use `undefined` instead of `defer`, it would likely cause errors or unexpected behavior when the code tries to call methods on the deferred object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that represents the absence of any object value, while `defer` is a function that creates a new deferred object. If the code were to use `null` instead of `defer`, it would likely cause errors or unexpected behavior when the code tries to call methods on the deferred object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred` is a variable that refers to a deferred object created by the `defer`
