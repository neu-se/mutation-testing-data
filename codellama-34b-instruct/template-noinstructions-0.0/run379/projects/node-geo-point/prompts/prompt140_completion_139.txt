  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the `adjustPrecision` method would return a new `GeoPoint` with the same latitude and longitude values, which would not be correct.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `adjustPrecision` method would return a new `GeoPoint` with a longitude value that is one degree greater than the original longitude value, which would not be correct.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `adjustPrecision` method would return a new `GeoPoint` with a longitude value that is one degree less than the original longitude value, which would not be correct.

DONE.
