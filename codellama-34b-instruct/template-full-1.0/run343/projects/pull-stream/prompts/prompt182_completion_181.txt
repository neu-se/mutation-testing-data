  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort, cb, abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, which could cause the method to behave differently when called with different arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length, i
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.length` is not the same as `i`, which is the index of the current element being processed. This could cause the method to behave differently when processing arrays of different lengths.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const isArray = require('is-array')
return function (abort, cb) {
  if (isArray(abort))
    return abortCb(cb, abort[0], onAbort)
  if (abort)
    return abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)
  return cb(true)
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `is-array` module is being
