  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the tile to be shifted one level down in the zoom hierarchy, potentially resulting in a different tile being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the tile to be shifted one level up in the zoom hierarchy, potentially resulting in a different tile being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the tile to be shifted two levels down in the zoom hierarchy, potentially resulting in a different tile being returned.

DONE.
