Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the expected number of arguments passed to the `array_slice` function, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the arguments and causing runtime errors or unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the total number of arguments instead of slicing the arguments array, which could lead to passing an incorrect number of arguments to the `dispatch` method, affecting the promise resolution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always slice the arguments array to include only the first argument, ignoring any additional arguments that may be necessary for the method call, leading to incorrect behavior or errors.

DONE.
