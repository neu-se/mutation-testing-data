  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always create a new error object, even if the original code fragment did not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not pass an error object at all, even if the original code fragment did.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a 'close' event instead of an 'error' event, even if the original code fragment did.

DONE.
