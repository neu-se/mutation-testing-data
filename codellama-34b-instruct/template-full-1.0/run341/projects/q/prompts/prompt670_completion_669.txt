  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, args[0]]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass only the first element of the `args` array as an argument to the `dispatch` method, rather than passing the entire array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, promises]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the entire `promises` array as an argument to the `dispatch` method, rather than passing the `args` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, promise]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `promise` object as an argument to the `dispatch` method, rather than passing the `args` array.

DONE.
