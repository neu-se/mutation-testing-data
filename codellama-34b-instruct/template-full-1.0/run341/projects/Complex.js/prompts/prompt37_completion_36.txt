  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_b
```
This would result in different behavior because `_b` is a different variable than `_a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a + _b
```
This would result in different behavior because `_a + _b` is a different expression than `_a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a * _b
```
This would result in different behavior because `_a * _b` is a different expression than `_a`.

DONE.
