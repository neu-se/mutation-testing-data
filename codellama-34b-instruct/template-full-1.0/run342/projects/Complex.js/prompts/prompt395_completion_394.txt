  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` and `sin` functions are related but not identical. In particular, `cos` gives the same result as `sin` but shifted by 90 degrees.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(Math.sin(b))
```
This would result in different behavior because `sqrt` is a non-linear function and can change the result significantly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because negating the result of `sin` flips the sign of the value, which can have a significant impact on the final result.

DONE.
