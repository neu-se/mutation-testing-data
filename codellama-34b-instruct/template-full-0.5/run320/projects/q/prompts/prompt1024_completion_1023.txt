  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `nodeback` function immediately, rather than passing it as an argument to `Q.nodeify`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the `nodeback` argument to `Q.nodeify`, rather than the expected function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `undefined` as the `nodeback` argument to `Q.nodeify`, rather than the expected function.

DONE.
