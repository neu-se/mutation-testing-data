  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rest.slice(this.index)
```
This would result in different behavior because `rest.slice(this.index)` would return a new array that starts from the current index, whereas `rest` returns the entire array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rest.slice(this.index, this.index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `rest.slice(this.index, this.index + 1)` would return a new array that only contains the current index, whereas `rest` returns the entire array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rest.slice(0, this.index)
```
This would result in different behavior because `rest.slice(0, this.index)` would return a new array that starts from the beginning and ends at the current index, whereas `rest` returns the entire array.

DONE.
