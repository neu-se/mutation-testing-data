  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return the first element of the array, regardless of the value of the `num` parameter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return the next element of the array, regardless of the value of the `num` parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return the previous element of the array, regardless of the value of the `num` parameter.

DONE.
