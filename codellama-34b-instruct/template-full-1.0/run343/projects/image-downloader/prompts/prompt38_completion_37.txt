  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dest + '/'
```
This would result in a different file path being created, as the addition of the `/` character would result in a different path being constructed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dest.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in a different file name being created, as the `split()` method would split the `dest` string into an array of substrings using `/` as the separator, and the `pop()` method would extract the last element of that array, which would be the file name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in a different file name being created, as the `Math.random()` method would generate a random number between 0 and 1, and that number would be used as the file name.

DONE.
