  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `.includes` is a method that checks if a string is included in the given string, while `.indexOf` is a method that returns the index of the first occurrence of the given string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.match
```
This would result in different behavior because `.match` is a method that checks if a string matches a regular expression, while `.indexOf` is a method that returns the index of the first occurrence of the given string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `.search` is a method that searches for a string in the given string and returns the index of the first occurrence, while `.indexOf` is a method that returns the index of the first occurrence of the given string.

DONE.
