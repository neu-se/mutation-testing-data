  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof this.matches !== 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` would return the string `'function'` for a function, but the code is expecting a boolean value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.matches && this.matches.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the length of the `matches` property, which is a function in the original code, but would be undefined or null if the `matches` function is not called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.matches.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would bind the `matches` function to a different `this` context, which could potentially cause a different result.

DONE.
