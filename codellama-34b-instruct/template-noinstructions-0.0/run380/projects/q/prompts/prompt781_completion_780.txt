  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
regardless()
```
This would result in different behavior because `regardless` is a function that returns a promise, but it is not being called as a function in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
regardless.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because `regardless.call()` is a function that returns a promise, but it is not being called as a function in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
regardless.apply()
```
This would result in different behavior because `regardless.apply()` is a function that returns a promise, but it is not being called as a function in the original code fragment.

DONE.
