  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` method is called on the `resolvedPromise` object, which is a different object than the `promise` object that was created in the `defer` function. This would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to be called on the `resolvedPromise` object, which may have different behavior than the `promiseDispatch` method on the `promise` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because the `Q` function is called on the `resolvedPromise` object, which is a different object than the `promise` object that was created in the `defer` function. This would cause the `Q` function to be called on the `resolvedPromise` object, which may have different behavior than the `Q` function on the `promise` object.
