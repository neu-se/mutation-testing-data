  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const policy = policies[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the first policy in the array, regardless of the name provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const policy = policies.find(p => p.name === name)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would find the policy with the matching name, but it would not handle the case where the policy is not found.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const policy = policies.find(p => p.name === name) || policies[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would find the policy with the matching name, but if it is not found, it would use the first policy in the array.

DONE.
