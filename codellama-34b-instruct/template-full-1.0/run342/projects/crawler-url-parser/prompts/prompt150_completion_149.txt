  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the separator between the path segments from `/` to `\`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the separator between the path segments from `/` to `\`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"/"
```
This would result in the same behavior as the original code fragment because it doesn't change the separator between the path segments.

DONE.
