  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` would be called with the arguments in reverse order, which could cause the function to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` would be called with the arguments starting from the second element, which could cause the function to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.concat([1, 2, 3])
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` would be called with the arguments concatenated with the array `[1, 2, 3]`, which could cause the function to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
