 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.create(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code creates a new promise object with `object_create(Promise.prototype)`, which inherits from the Promise prototype. By replacing it with `Object.create(null)`, the new promise object will not inherit from any prototype, breaking the intended inheritance chain and potentially causing issues in the proper functioning of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code creates a new promise object with `object_create(Promise.prototype)`, which explicitly uses the `Object.create` method to create a new object with the `Promise.prototype` as its prototype. By replacing it with `{}`, a plain object is created, which does not have the intended prototype and may cause issues in the proper functioning of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different
