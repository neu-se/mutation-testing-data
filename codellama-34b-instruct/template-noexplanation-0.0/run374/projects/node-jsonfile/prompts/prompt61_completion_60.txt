  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Buffer.isBuffer(content)
```
This code fragment is a function call to the `isBuffer` method of the `Buffer` class, which checks if the provided argument is a buffer. This is the same behavior as the original code fragment, which was `Buffer.isBuffer`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Buffer.isBuffer(content)
```
This code fragment is the negation of the original code fragment, which checks if the provided argument is not a buffer. This change in behavior could potentially cause the `stripBom` function to return a different result than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.isBuffer
```
This code fragment is a reference to the `isBuffer` property of the `content` object. This change in behavior could potentially cause the `stripBom` function to return a different result than expected, as the `isBuffer` property may not be defined for all objects.

DONE.
