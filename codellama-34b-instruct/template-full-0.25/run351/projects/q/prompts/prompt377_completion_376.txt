  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newValue + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would change the value of `newValue` to a different number, potentially causing the `deferred.notify` method to be called with a different value than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newValue * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator would change the value of `newValue` to a different number, potentially causing the `deferred.notify` method to be called with a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newValue - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operator would change the value of `newValue` to a different number, potentially causing the `deferred.notify` method to be called with a different value than the original code.

DONE.
