Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!object_hasOwnProperty(object, key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return keys for properties that do not exist on the object, effectively including non-own properties in the keys array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `hasOwnProperty` method directly from the `Object` prototype, which could lead to unexpected results if the object has been modified or if the prototype chain has been altered.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include properties that are explicitly set to `undefined`, which would not be considered own properties by `hasOwnProperty`, thus potentially returning keys that should not be included.

DONE.
