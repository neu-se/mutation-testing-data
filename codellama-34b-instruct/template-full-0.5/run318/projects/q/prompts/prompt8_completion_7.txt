  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return;
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return early, without executing the remaining code in the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error();
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would throw an error, causing the program to crash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a value of 0, which could cause unexpected behavior in the program.

DONE.
