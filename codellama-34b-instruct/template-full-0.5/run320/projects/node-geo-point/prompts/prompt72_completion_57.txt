  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDestination` method expects a number as the distance parameter, but `null` is not a number and would cause the method to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDestination` method expects a non-zero distance parameter, but `0` would cause the method to return the original coordinate without any calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDestination` method expects a positive distance parameter, but `-1` would cause the method to throw an error.

DONE.
