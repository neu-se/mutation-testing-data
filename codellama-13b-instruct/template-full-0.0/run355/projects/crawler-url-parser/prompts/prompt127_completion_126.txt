  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because the `linkurl` object is not guaranteed to have a `url` property, whereas the original code fragment is guaranteed to have a `url` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because the `linkurl` object is not guaranteed to have a `path` property, whereas the original code fragment is guaranteed to have a `path` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because the `linkurl` object is not guaranteed to have a `host` property, whereas the original code fragment is guaranteed to have a `host` property.

DONE.
