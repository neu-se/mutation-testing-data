  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester.test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `tester.test` is a different function than `tester`, and it may have a different implementation or behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester.test(data, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because `tester.test` with the second argument set to `true` would enable strict mode, which could cause the test to fail if the code being tested is not strict-mode compatible.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester.test(data, { strict: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because `tester.test` with the `strict` option set to `true` would enable strict mode, which could cause the test to fail if the code being tested is not strict-mode compatible.

DONE.
