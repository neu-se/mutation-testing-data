  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the PLACEHOLDER(void 0) is placed where there should be a function to handle the reject but 0 is placed and it will return a promise that is always resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Symbol('invalid')
```
This would result in different behavior because the PLACEHOLDER(void 0) is placed where there should be a function to handle the reject but Symbol('invalid') is placed and it will throw an error when the promise is rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the PLACEHOLDER(void 0) is placed where there should be a function to handle the reject but new Error() is placed and it will throw an error when the promise is rejected.

DONE.
