  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (promise) {
    promise.then(function (result) {
        deferred.resolve(result);
    });
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only handle the fulfilled branch of the promise, and not the rejected branch, meaning that any errors would go unnoticed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (promise) {
    promise.inspect().state === "rejected" ? deferred.reject(promise.inspect().reason) : deferred.resolve(promise.inspect().value);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only handle the rejected branch of the promise, and not the fulfilled branch, meaning that any successful results would go unnoticed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (promise) {
    var snapshot = promise.inspect();
    if (snapshot.state === "fulfilled") {
