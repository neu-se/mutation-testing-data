  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `abort`, so the `if` statement would be entered if `abort` is `false`, rather than if it is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, so the `if` statement would be entered if `abort` is strictly equal to `true`, rather than if it is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, so the `if` statement would be entered if `abort` is not strictly equal to `false`, rather than if it is truthy.

DONE.
