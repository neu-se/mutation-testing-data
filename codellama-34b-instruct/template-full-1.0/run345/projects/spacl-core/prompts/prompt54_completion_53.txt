  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes the last element from the array, while `push` adds an element to the end of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of the array, while `push` adds an element to the end of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.splice(0, 0, "something")
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` adds an element to a specific position in the array, in this case, the beginning (0).

DONE.
