  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof latitude !== 'number' || longitude === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the constructor to accept `null` as a valid value for the `longitude` parameter, even though the original code fragment requires it to be a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isObject(latitude) || !isObject(longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the constructor to accept non-objects as valid values for the `latitude` and `longitude` parameters, even though the original code fragment requires them to be objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
latitude > 90 || latitude < -90 || longitude > 180 || longitude < -180
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the constructor to accept latitude and longitude values outside of the valid range of -90 to 90 degrees and -180 to 180 degrees,
