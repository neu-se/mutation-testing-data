 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
typeof length !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would now check for non-number types instead of checking if the length is less than or equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would now check if the length is greater than 0 instead of checking if it is less than or equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
length > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would now allow a length of 0, which should be forbidden according to the original condition.

DONE.
