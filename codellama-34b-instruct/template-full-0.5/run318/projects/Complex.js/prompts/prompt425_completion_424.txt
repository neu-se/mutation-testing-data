  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` function is not defined in the `Complex` class, so this line of code would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](this);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` function is not defined in the `Complex` class, so this line of code would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](Infinity);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` function is not defined in the `Complex` class, so this line of code would throw a `ReferenceError`.

DONE.
