  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(a) > Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is less than `Complex['EPSILON']`, which means it is smaller than a certain threshold, while the new code fragment checks if `a` is greater than `Complex['EPSILON']`, which means it is larger than the same threshold.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(a) <= Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is less than `Complex['EPSILON']`, which means it is smaller than a certain threshold, while the new code fragment checks if `a` is less than or equal to `Complex['EPSILON']`, which means it is smaller than or equal to the same threshold.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(a) !==
