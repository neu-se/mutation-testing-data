  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString` is a different method than `obj`, and it may return a different string representation of the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.valueOf` is a different method than `obj`, and it may return a different value for the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.hasOwnProperty('toString')
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty` is a different method than `obj`, and it may return a different result for the object.

DONE.
