  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process !== "object" || typeof process.emit !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `process` is an object and has an `emit` function, while this replacement checks if `process` is not an object or does not have an `emit` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process === "undefined" || typeof process.emit === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `process` is an object and has an `emit` function, while this replacement checks if `process` is undefined or its `emit` function is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process !== "object" || typeof process.emit !== "function" || process.emit !== "unhandledRejection"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `process` is an object and has an `emit` function, while this replacement checks if `
