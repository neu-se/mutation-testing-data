  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'coordinates'[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the first element of the `coordinates` array, rather than the array itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'coordinates'[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the second element of the `coordinates` array, rather than the array itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'latlng'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would refer to a nonexistent property `latlng` of `point`, rather than the existing property `coordinates`.

DONE.
