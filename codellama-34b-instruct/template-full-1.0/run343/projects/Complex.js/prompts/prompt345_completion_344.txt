  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinh` function returns the hyperbolic sine of a complex number, which is different from the `cosh` function that was originally used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coth
```
This would result in different behavior because the `coth` function returns the hyperbolic cotangent of a complex number, which is different from the `cosh` function that was originally used.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tanh
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tanh` function returns the hyperbolic tangent of a complex number, which is different from the `cosh` function that was originally used.

DONE.
