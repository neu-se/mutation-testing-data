  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of resolving the promise, the `reject` method will be called, causing the promise to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve` is a method that returns a promise that resolves with the specified value, whereas `deferred.resolve` is a method that resolves the promise associated with the `deferred` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.fulfill
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.fulfill` is a method that resolves the promise associated with the `deferred` object with the value returned from the `fulfill` method, whereas `deferred.resolve` is a method that resolves the promise with the specified value.

DONE.
