  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.on('close', () => {
  this._writeStream = null;
  this._writeStream.emit('write_close');
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits the `write_close` event on `this`, while the modified code emits it on `this._writeStream`, which is the actual stream that is being closed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.on('close', () => {
  this._writeStream = null;
  this.emit('write_close');
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits the `write_close` event on `this._writeStream`, while the modified code emits it on `this`, which is the instance of the `Dirty` class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.on('close', () => {
  this._writeStream = null
