  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stringify` function would return a different string when passed `null` instead of `obj`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stringify` function would return a different string when passed `undefined` instead of `obj`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stringify` function would return a different string when passed an empty object instead of `obj`.

DONE.
