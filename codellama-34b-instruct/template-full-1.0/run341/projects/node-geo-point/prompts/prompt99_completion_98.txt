  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x, y
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is swapped, causing the function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * x, 2 * y
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would now return a different scaled version of the input coordinates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + y, x - y
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would now return a different translated and scaled version of the input coordinates.

DONE.
