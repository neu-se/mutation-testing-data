  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || false, done || function () {}
```
This change will cause the `read` function to be called with `abort` set to `false`, which will cause the `while` loop to continue running even if `abort` is set to `true`. This will result in the `read` function being called repeatedly, even if the stream has been aborted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || true, done || function () {}
```
This change will cause the `read` function to be called with `abort` set to `true`, which will cause the `while` loop to exit immediately. This will result in the `read` function being called only once, even if the stream has not been aborted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || true, done || function () {}
```
This change will cause the `read` function to be called with `abort` set to `true`, which will cause the `
