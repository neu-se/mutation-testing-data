  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` function checks if the imaginary part of the complex number is zero, while the original code fragment checks if the variable `d` is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c < b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `c` variable represents the real part of the complex number, while the `b` variable represents the imaginary part. The comparison would have different semantics in the context of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(z['re']) > Math.abs(z['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.abs` function takes the absolute value of a number, and the comparison would have different semantics in the context of the function.

DONE.
