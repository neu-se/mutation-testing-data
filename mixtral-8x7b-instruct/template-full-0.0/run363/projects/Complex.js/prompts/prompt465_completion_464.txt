 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the imaginary part is flipped when the complex number is represented as a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the current instance's imaginary part instead of the input parameter `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the imaginary part would always be `0`, even if the input parameter `b` is not.

DONE.
