  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getNumStr(min * -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.abs()` function to get the absolute value of the input, while this replacement code fragment uses the `* -1` operator to negate the input. This would cause the resulting string to be different in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getNumStr(min + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.abs()` function to get the absolute value of the input, while this replacement code fragment adds 1 to the input before getting the absolute value. This would cause the resulting string to be different in some cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getNumStr(min - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.abs()` function to get the absolute value of the input, while this replacement code fragment subtracts 1
