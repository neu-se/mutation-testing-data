  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator)();
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be immediately invoked, rather than being returned as a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator).fail(console.error);
```
This would result in different behavior because any errors that occur during the asynchronous execution would be logged to the console, rather than being returned as a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator).delay(1000);
```
This would result in different behavior because the asynchronous code would be delayed by one second, rather than being executed immediately.

DONE.
