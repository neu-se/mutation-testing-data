  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `void 0`, which is a way to represent the absence of a value in JavaScript. Replacing it with `1` would cause the function to return the number 1 instead of `undefined`, which could potentially cause issues if the function is expected to return a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `void 0`, which is a way to represent the absence of a value in JavaScript. Replacing it with `null` would cause the function to return `null` instead of `undefined`, which could potentially cause issues if the function is expected to return a promise.
