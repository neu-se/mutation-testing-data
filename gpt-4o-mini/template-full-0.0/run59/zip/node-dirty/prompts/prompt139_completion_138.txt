Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.length > 0 && err == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if there are callbacks in the `cbs` array and if there is no error, which would prevent the error event from being emitted even when an error occurs if there are callbacks present.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cbs.length || err === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit the error only if there are no callbacks or if the error is explicitly `undefined`, which could lead to situations where errors are ignored if they are not `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.length === 0 && err != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit the error only when there are no callbacks and an error exists, which could lead to missed error handling if callbacks are present, regardless of whether an error occurred.

DONE.
