 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.keys(a).length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `a` is an empty object instead of checking if `a` is not an object. This could cause the function to behave unexpectedly when `a` is a primitive type like a number or string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
a === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `a` is null, which is a more specific case than checking if `a` is not an object. This could cause the function to skip the assignment `a = {}` when `a` is undefined or any other non-object value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
typeof a !== 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `a` is not a function, which is a broader condition than checking if `a` is not an object. This could cause the function
