  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, true, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function would be called with `true` as the first argument, which would cause the callback to be called with an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, false, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function would be called with `false` as the first argument, which would cause the callback to be called with a success value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, undefined, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function would be called with `undefined` as the first argument, which would cause the callback to be called with an error.

DONE.
