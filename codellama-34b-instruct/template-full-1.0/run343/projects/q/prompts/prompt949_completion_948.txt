  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object, thisp, arguments[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the function with the arguments passed as an array, rather than a list of arguments, which would cause the function to be called with the wrong arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the function with the arguments passed as a list of arguments, rather than an array, which would cause the function to be called with the wrong arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the function with an undefined value as the "this" argument, which would cause the function to be called in a different context.

DONE.
