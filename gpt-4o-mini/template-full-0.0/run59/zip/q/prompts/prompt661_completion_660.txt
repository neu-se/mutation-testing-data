Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to invoke a "get" operation instead of a "post" operation, leading to incorrect method invocation and potentially causing the promise to resolve with an unexpected value or error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would try to perform a "set" operation instead of a "post" operation, which would not match the intended functionality of invoking a method, thus causing the promise to fail or resolve incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to perform a "delete" operation instead of a "post" operation, which would not be valid in the context of invoking a method, leading to unexpected results or errors in the promise chain.

DONE.
