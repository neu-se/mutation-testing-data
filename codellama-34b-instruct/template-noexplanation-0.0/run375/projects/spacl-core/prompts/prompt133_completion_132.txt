  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.verbs.slice()
```
This code fragment creates a shallow copy of the `verbs` object, which can be used to test the `clone` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.verbs.concat()
```
This code fragment creates a new array that contains the elements of the `verbs` object, which can be used to test the `clone` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.verbs.map(verb => verb)
```
This code fragment creates a new array that contains the elements of the `verbs` object, which can be used to test the `clone` method.

DONE.
