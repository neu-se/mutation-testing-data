  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Number` constructor returns a number primitive, while the `String` constructor returns a string primitive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Boolean
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Number` constructor returns a number primitive, while the `Boolean` constructor returns a boolean primitive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Number` constructor returns a number primitive, while `Math.PI` is a floating-point number.

DONE.
