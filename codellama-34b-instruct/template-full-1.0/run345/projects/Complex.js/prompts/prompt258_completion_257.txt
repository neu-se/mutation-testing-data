  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
 `b === 0 && a > 0`
This would result in different behavior because the code would not handle the case where `a` is less than or equal to zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
 `a === 0 && b > 0`
This would result in different behavior because the code would not handle the case where `b` is less than or equal to zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
 `a > 0 && b > 0`
This would result in different behavior because the code would not handle the case where either `a` or `b` is less than or equal to zero.

DONE.
