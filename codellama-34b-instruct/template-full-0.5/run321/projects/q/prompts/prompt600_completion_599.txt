  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op, args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method is called on the `args` array, which would modify the arguments passed to the `promiseDispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op, args.concat(["extra argument"])
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument is added to the `args` array, which would modify the arguments passed to the `promiseDispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op, args.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse` method is called on the `args` array, which would modify the order of the arguments passed to the `promiseDispatch` method.

DONE.
