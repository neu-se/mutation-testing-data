  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the condition, so the code would execute the `cb(aborted)` call even if `aborted` is false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted && err
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator short-circuits the evaluation of the expression if `aborted` is false, so the `err` variable would not be evaluated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err && aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator short-circuits the evaluation of the expression if `err` is false, so the `aborted` variable would not be evaluated.

DONE.
