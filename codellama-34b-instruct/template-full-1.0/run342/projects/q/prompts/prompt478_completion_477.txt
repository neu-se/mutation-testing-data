  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.splice(at, unhandledRejections.length);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove all unhandled rejections from the array, instead of just the one at the specified index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.splice(at, 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the unhandled rejection at the specified index, as well as the next one in the array, instead of just the one at the specified index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.splice(at, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the unhandled reason at the specified index, instead of just the unhandled rejection.

DONE.
