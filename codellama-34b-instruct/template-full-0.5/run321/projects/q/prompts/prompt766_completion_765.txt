  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (err) {
    deferred.reject(err);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment, `noop`, does not reject the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (err) {
    deferred.resolve(err);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment, `noop`, does not resolve the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (err) {
    deferred.notify(err);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment, `noop`, does not notify the promise.

DONE.
