  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array would have one more element than the original code, which could cause the `dispatch` method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array would have one fewer element than the original code, which could cause the `dispatch` method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array would be empty, which could cause the `dispatch` method to behave differently.

DONE.
