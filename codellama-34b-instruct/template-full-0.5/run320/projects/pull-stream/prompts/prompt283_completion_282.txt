  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` function is called instead of the `cb` function, which could cause the program to terminate unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value is returned instead of the `data` value, which could cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty function is returned instead of the `data` value, which could cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.

DONE.
