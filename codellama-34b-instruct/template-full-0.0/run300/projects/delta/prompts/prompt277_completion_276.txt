  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.next` would return the next operation in the iterator, whereas `iter.peek` would return the next operation without advancing the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.peekLength` would return the length of the next operation, whereas `iter.peek` would return the next operation itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.peekType` would return the type of the next operation, whereas `iter.peek` would return the next operation itself.

DONE.
