  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map && !map.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `!map` checks if `map` is falsy, while the new code fragment `map && !map.length` checks if `map` is not only falsy, but also has a length of 0. This means that if `map` is a truthy value with a length of 1 or more, the new code fragment will return `false`, while the original code fragment would return `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `!map` checks if `map` is falsy, while the new code fragment `map.length > 0` checks if `map` has a length greater than 0. This means that if `map` is a truthy value and has a length of 0, the new code fragment will return `false`, while the original code fragment would return `true`.
