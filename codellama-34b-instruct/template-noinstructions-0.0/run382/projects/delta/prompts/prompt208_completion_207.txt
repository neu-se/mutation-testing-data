  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.chop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `chop` method on the `delta` object, which removes any trailing retain ops from the delta, while the new code fragment does not call the `chop` method, so the delta would contain trailing retain ops.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.chop(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `chop` method on the `delta` object with no arguments, which removes any trailing retain ops from the delta, while the new code fragment calls the `chop` method with an argument of 1, which removes the first retain op from the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.chop(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `chop` method on the `delta` object with no arguments, which removes any trailing retain o
