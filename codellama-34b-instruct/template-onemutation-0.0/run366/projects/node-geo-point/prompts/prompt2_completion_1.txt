  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
latitude < -90 || latitude > 90 || latitude === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks for latitude values less than -90 or greater than 90, but the new code fragment also checks for latitude values equal to 0. This change would cause the `RangeError` to be thrown for latitude values of 0, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
