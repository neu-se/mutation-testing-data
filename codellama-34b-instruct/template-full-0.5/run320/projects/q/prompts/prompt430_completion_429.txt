  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect(<PLACEHOLDER>).state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, regardless of the value of `object.inspect(<PLACEHOLDER>).state`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect(<PLACEHOLDER>).state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, regardless of the value of `object.inspect(<PLACEHOLDER>).state`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect(<PLACEHOLDER>).state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, regardless of the value of `object.inspect(<PLACEHOLDER>).state`.

DONE.
