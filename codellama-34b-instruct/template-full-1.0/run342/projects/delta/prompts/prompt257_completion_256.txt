  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("Hello World")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a new behavior of printing "Hello World" to the console.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let value = 10;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce a new variable `value` with a different value than the original implementation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function add(a, b) { return a + b; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce a new function `add` that would change the calculation performed by the original implementation.

DONE.
