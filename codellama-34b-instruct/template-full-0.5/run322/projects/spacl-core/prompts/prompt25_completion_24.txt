  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
final && !opt && min < 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!opt` would negate the `opt` variable, causing the code to execute the `min < 1` check even if the `opt` variable is true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
final && opt && min < 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `min < 2` check would be executed even if the `opt` variable is false, causing the code to behave differently in certain cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
final && opt && min < 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the `min < 3` check would be executed even if the `opt` variable is false, causing the code to behave differently in certain cases.

DONE.
