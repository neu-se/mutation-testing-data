  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `_has_illegal_chars` is called with the `baseUrlStr` argument, which is not what the original code does. The original code calls the function with the `currentUrlStr` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!_has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `_has_illegal_chars` is called with the `baseUrlStr` argument, which is not what the original code does. The original code calls the function with the `currentUrlStr` argument. Additionally, the `!` operator is used to negate the result of the function, which would cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr) && _has_illegal_chars(currentUrl
