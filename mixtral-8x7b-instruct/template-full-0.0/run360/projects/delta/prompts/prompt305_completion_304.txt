 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
line.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property is accessed directly without calling the `length()` method. This change may cause issues if the `Delta` class has an overridden `length()` method or if the `line` variable is not an array-like object with a `length` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
line.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the threshold for the length of `line` is changed from 0 to 1. This change would cause the predicate function to skip iterating over the `line` variable when its length is 1, which may lead to unexpected behavior in the `eachLine` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
line.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the strict equality comparison (`===`) is used instead of the loose equality comparison
