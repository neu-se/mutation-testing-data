  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType !== 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next type is 'delete', while this new code fragment checks if it is not 'delete'. This could cause the code to behave differently in certain scenarios, such as when the next type is not 'delete' but the code still needs to handle deletions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next type is 'delete', while this new code fragment checks if it is 'insert'. This could cause the code to behave differently in certain scenarios, such as when the next type is 'insert' but the code still needs to handle deletions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next type is 'delete', while this new code fragment checks if it is 'retain'.
