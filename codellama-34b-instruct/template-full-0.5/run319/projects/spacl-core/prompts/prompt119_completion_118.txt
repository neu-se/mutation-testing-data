  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the path to lowercase, potentially causing the `matches()` method to return false even if the path matches the rule.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method would remove the first character of the path, potentially causing the `matches()` method to return false even if the path matches the rule.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.replace(/[a-zA-Z]/g, '*')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace()` method would replace all letters in the path with asterisks, potentially causing the `matches()` method to return false even if the path matches the rule.

DONE.
