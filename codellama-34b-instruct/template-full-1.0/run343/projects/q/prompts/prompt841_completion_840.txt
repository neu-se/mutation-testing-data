  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError
```
This would result in different behavior because the `void 0` expression would be replaced with an undefined identifier, causing a ReferenceError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `void 0` expression would be replaced with the result of calling the `onUnhandledError` function, which would potentially have different side effects than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fcall(onUnhandledError)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `void 0` expression would be replaced with a Q promise that resolves to the return value of calling the `onUnhandledError` function, which could also potentially have different behavior than the original code.

DONE.
