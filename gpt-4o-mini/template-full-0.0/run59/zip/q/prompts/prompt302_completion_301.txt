Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x != y
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for inequality instead of equality, meaning that it would throw an error if `x` and `y` are not the same, even if they are equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `x` is strictly equal to `null`, which would only throw an error if `x` is `null`, regardless of the value of `y`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `x` is strictly equal to `undefined`, which would throw an error if `x` is `undefined`, ignoring the value of `y`.

DONE.
