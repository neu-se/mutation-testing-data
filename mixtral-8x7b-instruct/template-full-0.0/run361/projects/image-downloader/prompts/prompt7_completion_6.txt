 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the code block that checks if the destination path has an extension would not execute, and the `options.dest` value would not be updated with the decoded basename from the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code block that checks if the destination path has an extension would not execute, and the `options.dest` value would not be updated with the decoded basename from the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!path.extname(options.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code block would now check the extension of the URL instead of the destination path, and the `options.dest` value would not be updated with the decoded basename from the URL.

DONE.
