  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[value, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, which could cause the `set` method to set the wrong property on the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument is null, which could cause the `set` method to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument is undefined, which could cause the `set` method to throw an error.

DONE.
