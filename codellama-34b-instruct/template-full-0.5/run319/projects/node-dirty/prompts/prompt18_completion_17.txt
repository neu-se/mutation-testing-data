  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.filter(cb => cb !== null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would include null values in the list of callbacks, while the modified code fragment would filter them out.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.map(cb => () => cb(key, val))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would call the callbacks with the key and value as arguments, while the modified code fragment would call the callbacks with the key and a function that returns the value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.forEach(cb => cb(key, val))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would call the callbacks with the key and value as arguments, while the modified code fragment would call the callbacks with the key and value as separate arguments.

DONE.
