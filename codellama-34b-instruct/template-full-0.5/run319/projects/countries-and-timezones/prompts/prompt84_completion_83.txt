  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `c` returns the country object, while `c + 1` returns a new object that is the result of adding 1 to the country object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c.id + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `c` returns the country object, while `c.id + 1` returns a new object that is the result of adding 1 to the country object's `id` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c.name + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `c` returns the country object, while `c.name + 1` returns a new object that is the result of adding 1 to the country object's `name` property.

DONE.
