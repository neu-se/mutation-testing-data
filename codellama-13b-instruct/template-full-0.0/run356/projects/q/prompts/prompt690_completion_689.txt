  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the second argument to the `dispatch` method, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the third argument to the `dispatch` method, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 3)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the fourth argument to the `dispatch` method, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
