  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would no longer replace any characters after the first `#` character in the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'^'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would now replace any characters after the first `^` character in the string, rather than just the first `#` character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would now replace any characters after the first `/` character in the string, rather than just the first `#` character.

DONE.
