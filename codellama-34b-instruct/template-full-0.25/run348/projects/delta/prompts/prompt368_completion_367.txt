  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was missing the parentheses, which would cause the `peekType` method to not be called, resulting in a different value being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was not passing any arguments to the `peekType` method, while this replacement code fragment passes the argument `1`, which would cause the method to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType(otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was not passing any arguments to the `peekType` method, while this replacement code fragment passes the length of the peeked operation as an argument, which would cause the method to return a different value.

DONE.
