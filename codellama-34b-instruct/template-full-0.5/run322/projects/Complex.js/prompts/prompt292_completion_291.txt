  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `a + 1` is a different value than `a`, and the `Math.atan2` function will return a different result when given a different input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `a * 2` is a different value than `a`, and the `Math.atan2` function will return a different result when given a different input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `a - 1` is a different value than `a`, and the `Math.atan2` function will return a different result when given a different input.

DONE.
