  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.startsWith(pageurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because `startsWith` would only check if `linkurl_path` begins with `pageurl_path`, while `includes` would check if `pageurl_path` is contained anywhere within `linkurl_path`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.endsWith(pageurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because `endsWith` would only check if `linkurl_path` ends with `pageurl_path`, while `includes` would check if `pageurl_path` is contained anywhere within `linkurl_path`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.indexOf(pageurl_path) !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` would check if `pageurl_path` is contained anywhere within `linkurl_path`, while `includes` would perform a similar
