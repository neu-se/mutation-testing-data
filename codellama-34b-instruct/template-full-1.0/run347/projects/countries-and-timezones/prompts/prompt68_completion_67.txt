  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!country.name
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the country object does not have a name property, rather than checking if the country object does not exist.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for null instead of undefined, and it would not check for other falsy values such as an empty string or the number 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof country === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for the country variable being undefined, rather than checking for it being falsey.

DONE.
