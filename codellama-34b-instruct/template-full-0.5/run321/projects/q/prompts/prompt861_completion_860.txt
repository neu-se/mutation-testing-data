  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeout !== void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `timeout` would always be considered to be defined, even if it was not passed as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeout !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `timeout` would be considered to be defined if it was null, even if it was not passed as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeout !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `timeout` would be considered to be defined if it was undefined, even if it was not passed as an argument.

DONE.
