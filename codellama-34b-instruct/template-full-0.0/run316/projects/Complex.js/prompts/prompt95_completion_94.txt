  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the input is a string, while the replaced code fragment is checking if the input is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the input is a string, while the replaced code fragment is checking if the input is a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the input is a string, while the replaced code fragment is checking if the input is a number.

DONE.
