Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the type of the current operation from `thisIter` instead of `otherIter`, potentially leading to incorrect handling of operations when composing two deltas.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if there are any remaining operations in `otherIter` instead of checking the type of the next operation, which could cause the composition logic to skip necessary operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the code to always treat the next operation as a 'delete', ignoring the actual type of the operation from `otherIter`, which could lead to incorrect delta composition.

DONE.
