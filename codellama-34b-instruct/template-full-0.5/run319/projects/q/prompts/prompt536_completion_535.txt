  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value
```
This would result in different behavior because `value` is not a function and would cause a `TypeError` when trying to call it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function and would cause a `TypeError` when trying to call it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function and would cause a `TypeError` when trying to call it.

DONE.
