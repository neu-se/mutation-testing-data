  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first segment of the path, which could cause the matcher to fail to match certain paths that it should match.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last segment of the path, which could cause the matcher to fail to match certain paths that it should match.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first and last segments of the path, which could cause the matcher to fail to match certain paths that it should match.

DONE.
