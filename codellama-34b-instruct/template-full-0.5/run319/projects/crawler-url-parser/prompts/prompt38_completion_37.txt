  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr, false, false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would be called with the `slashesDenoteHost` and `parseQueryString` options set to `false`, which would cause the method to parse the URL differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr, true, true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would be called with the `baseUrl` parameter set to `baseUrlStr`, which would cause the method to parse the URL differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://' + currentUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would be called with the `protocol` parameter set to `'https://'`, which would cause the method to parse the URL differently.

DONE.
