  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b == x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `x` is between `-b` and `b`, while this new code fragment only checks if `x` is equal to `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * (x - b) > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `x` is between `-b` and `b`, while this new code fragment checks if `x` is between `0` and `b`, and also checks if `x` is less than `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(x) + sin(x) > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `x` is between `-b` and `b`, while this new code fragment checks if `x` is between `0` and `π`, and also checks if `x` is less than `π/2
