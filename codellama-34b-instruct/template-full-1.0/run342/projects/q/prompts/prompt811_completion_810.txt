  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(object).then(function (value) {
    return callback.fcall().return(value);
}, function (reason) {
    // TODO attempt to recycle the rejection with "this".
    return callback.fcall().throw(reason);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the "reject" method is replaced with "throw", which would cause the rejection to be thrown as an exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(object).then(function (value) {
    return callback.fcall().done(value);
}, function (reason) {
    // TODO attempt to recycle the rejection with "this".
    return callback.fcall().done(reason);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the "reject" method is replaced with "done", which would cause the rejection to be handled as a success.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
