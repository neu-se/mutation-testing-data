  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the result of the `promiseDispatch` method, which is a promise. Replacing it with `null` would cause the `then` method to return a promise that resolves to `null`, which is different from the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the result of the `promiseDispatch` method, which is a promise. Replacing it with `undefined` would cause the `then` method to return a promise that resolves to `undefined`, which is different from the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("foo")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the result of the `promiseDispatch` method, which is a promise. Replacing it with an error-throwing statement would cause the `then` method to return a promise
