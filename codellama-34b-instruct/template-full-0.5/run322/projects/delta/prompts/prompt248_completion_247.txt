  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the other iterator instead of the length of the current iterator, which could cause the diff algorithm to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the current iterator plus one, which could cause the diff algorithm to produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the current iterator minus one, which could cause the diff algorithm to produce incorrect results.

DONE.
