  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
never
```
This would result in different behavior because `never` is a synchronous function that returns a promise that is never resolved, whereas `once` is an asynchronous function that returns a promise that is resolved with the first value from the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(stream, { objectMode: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because `once` with the `objectMode` option set to `true` will return a promise that is resolved with the first object from the stream, whereas the original code fragment returns a promise that is resolved with the first value from the stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(stream, { arrayMode: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because `once` with the `arrayMode` option set to `true` will return a promise that is resolved with the first array from the stream, whereas the original code fragment returns a promise that is resolved with the first value from the stream.
