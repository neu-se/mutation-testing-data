  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that rejects the promise, while `promiseDispatch` is a property that holds the function to be called when the promise is resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject` is a function that creates a new rejected promise, while `promiseDispatch` is a property that holds the function to be called when the promise is resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, while `promiseDispatch` is a property that holds a function to be called when the promise is resolved.

DONE.
