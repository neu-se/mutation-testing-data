  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the provided value. In this case, the `this` keyword would be set to the `callback` function, which would cause the `callback` function to be called with the `this` keyword set to the `callback` function, rather than the `this` keyword being set to the `Q` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method calls the `callback` function with the `this` keyword set to the provided value, which in this case would be the `Q` function. This would cause the `callback` function to be called with the `this` keyword set to the `Q` function, rather than the `this` keyword being set to the `callback` function.
