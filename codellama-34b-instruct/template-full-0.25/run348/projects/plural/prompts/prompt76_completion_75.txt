  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'die'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'dice'`, which is a valid plural form of the word "die", but `'die'` is not a valid plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'dies'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'dice'`, which is a valid plural form of the word "die", but `'dies'` is not a valid plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'die' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'dice'`, which is a valid plural form of the word "die", but `'die' + 's'` is not a valid plural form.

DONE.
