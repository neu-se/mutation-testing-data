  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `options.dest` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `options.dest` is strictly equal to `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest !== ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `options.dest` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `options.dest` is not equal to the empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!options.hasOwnProperty('dest')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `options.dest` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `options.dest` is not a property of the `options` object.

DONE.
