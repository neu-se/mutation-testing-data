 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` function would not properly handle the `retain` operation with attribute objects, as the `AttributeMap.invert` function expects a non-null value for the `attributes` parameter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` function would treat the `retain` operation as if it had no attributes, which could lead to incorrect behavior if the original operation had specific attribute values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisOp.attributes || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always pass an empty object as the second argument to `AttributeMap.invert`, even if the original `op` had non-null attributes. This could lead to incorrect behavior if the original attributes had specific values that were necessary for the proper functioning of the `invert` function.

DONE.
