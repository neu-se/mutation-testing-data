  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodeURI
```
This would result in different behavior because `decodeURI` only decodes the URI syntax, whereas `decodeURIComponent` decodes both the URI syntax and any escape sequences in the URI.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
encodeURIComponent
```
This would result in different behavior because `encodeURIComponent` encodes the URI syntax and any escape sequences in the URI, whereas `decodeURIComponent` only decodes the URI syntax.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodeURIComponent(basename).toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would lowercase the basename before decoding it, whereas the original code fragment does not modify the basename before decoding it.

DONE.
