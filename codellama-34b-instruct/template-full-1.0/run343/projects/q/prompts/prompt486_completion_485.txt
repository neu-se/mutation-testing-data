  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `resetUnhandledRejections` function, which resets the `unhandledRejections` array, effectively clearing any previous unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would directly set the `length` property of the `unhandledRejections` array to 0, achieving the same result as calling the `resetUnhandledRejections` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections = []
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reassign the `unhandledRejections` variable to an empty array, effectively clearing any previous unhandled rejections.

DONE.
