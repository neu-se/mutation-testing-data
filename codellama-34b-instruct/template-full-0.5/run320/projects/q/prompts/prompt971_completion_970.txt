  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first argument to the method, whereas the original code passes all arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass all arguments except the first one to the method, whereas the original code passes all arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat(["extra argument"])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass all arguments and an extra argument to the method, whereas the original code passes only the original arguments.

DONE.
