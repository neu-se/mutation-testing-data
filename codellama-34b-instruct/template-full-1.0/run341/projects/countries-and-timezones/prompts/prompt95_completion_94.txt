  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `country === null` checks for null, while `!country` checks for falsy values (null, 0, NaN, undefined, etc.).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country && country.timezones.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `country && country.timezones.length === 0` checks for the presence of the `country` object and the existence of the `timezones` property with a length of 0, while `!country` only checks for falsy values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(country).length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys(country).length === 0` checks for an empty object, while `!country` checks for falsy values.

DONE.
