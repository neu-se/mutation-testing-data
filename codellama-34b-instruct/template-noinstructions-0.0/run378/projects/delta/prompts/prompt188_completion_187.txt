  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'embed'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function would return a different value for the `embedType` variable, which is used to determine the type of embed to be composed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function would return a different value for the `embedType` variable, which is used to determine the type of embed to be composed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function would return a different value for the `embedType` variable, which is used to determine the type of embed to be composed.

DONE.
