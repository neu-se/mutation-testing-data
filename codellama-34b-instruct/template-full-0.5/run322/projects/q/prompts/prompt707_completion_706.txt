  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last element from the arguments array, which could potentially cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the elements in the arguments array, which could potentially cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first element of the arguments array, which could potentially cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
