  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with buggy code fragments:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString` expects an object as its argument, but `null` is not an object. This would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString` expects an object as its argument, but `1` is a number, not an object. This would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString` expects an object as its argument, but `object` is not a valid object. This would cause an error to be thrown.

DONE.
