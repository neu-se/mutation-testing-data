  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the third argument from the `arguments` array instead of the second, which could lead to unexpected results if the function is called with a different number of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the fourth argument from the `arguments` array instead of the third, which could lead to unexpected results if the function is called with a different number of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2] + ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the third and fourth arguments from the `arguments` array instead of passing them separately, which could lead to unexpected results if the function is called with a different number of arguments.
