 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'http:/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not match URLs with double slashes at the beginning, which are used to indicate a protocol-relative URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'^//'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match URLs with single or double slashes at the beginning, which could lead to incorrect parsing of the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'^/+'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match URLs with one or more forward slashes at the beginning, which could lead to incorrect parsing of the URL.

DONE.
