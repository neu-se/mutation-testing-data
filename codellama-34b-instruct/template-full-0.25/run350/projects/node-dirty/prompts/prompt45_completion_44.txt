  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key` variable is incremented by 1, which would cause the `set` method to store the value at the wrong key in the database.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `val` variable is incremented by 1, which would cause the `set` method to store the wrong value in the database.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method is called on the `this._data` object, which is not the same object as the `this` object that the `set` method is called on.

DONE.
