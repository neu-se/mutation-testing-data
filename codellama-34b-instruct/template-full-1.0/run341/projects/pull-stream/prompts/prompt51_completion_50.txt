  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a type error, as `s` is not an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s[""]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a runtime error, as `s` is not a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s?.()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a runtime error, as `s` is not a function.

DONE.
