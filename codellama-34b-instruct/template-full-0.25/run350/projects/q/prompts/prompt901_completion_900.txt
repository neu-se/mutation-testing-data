  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` to create a callback function that is passed to the `setTimeout` function, which is then used to reject the promise with the `error` object. In contrast, the modified code fragment would reject the promise immediately with the `error` object, without waiting for the timeout to elapse.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` to create a callback function that is passed to the `setTimeout` function, which is then used to resolve the promise with the `value` object. In contrast, the modified code fragment would resolve the promise immediately with the `value` object, without waiting for the timeout to elapse.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(value);
```
