  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the key in the queue to `undefined`, instead of the list of callbacks.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.delete(key);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the key from the queue, instead of setting it to a list of callbacks.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the key in the queue to the callback function, instead of a list of callbacks.

DONE.
