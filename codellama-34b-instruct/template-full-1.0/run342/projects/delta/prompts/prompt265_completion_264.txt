  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push(otherOp).retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the retain function call was omitted, which would cause the delta object to be mutated differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.retain(otherOp).push
```
This would result in different behavior because the push function call was changed to be after the retain function call, which would cause the delta object to be mutated differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push(otherOp).retain()
```
This would result in different behavior because the retain function call was added but the push function call was omitted, which would cause the delta object to be mutated differently.

DONE.
