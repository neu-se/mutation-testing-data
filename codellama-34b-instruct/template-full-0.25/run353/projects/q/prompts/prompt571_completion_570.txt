  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` and `apply` are different methods of the `Function` object, and they have different behavior when it comes to handling `this` and arguments. In this case, using `call` instead of `apply` would cause the function to be called with the wrong `this` value, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function that is bound to a specific `this` value, whereas `apply` and `call` simply call the function with a specific `this` value. In this case, using `bind` instead of `apply` or `call` would cause the function to be called with the wrong `this` value, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.apply(null)
```
This would result in
