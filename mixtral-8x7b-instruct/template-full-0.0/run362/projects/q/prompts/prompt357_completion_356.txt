 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Error("New error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because a new error message is created instead of using the original exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because a null value is returned instead of the original exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
