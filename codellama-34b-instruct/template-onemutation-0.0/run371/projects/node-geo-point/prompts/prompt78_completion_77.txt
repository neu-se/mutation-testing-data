  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ1 * sinδ * cosθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `sin` function to calculate the sine of the latitude, while the new code fragment uses the `sin` function to calculate the sine of the angular distance. This would cause the calculation of the destination point to be incorrect.

DONE.
