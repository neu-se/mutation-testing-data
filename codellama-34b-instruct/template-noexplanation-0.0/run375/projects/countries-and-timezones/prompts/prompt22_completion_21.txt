  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.d + 1
```
This change will cause the `dstOffset` variable to be one hour ahead of the `utcOffset`, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.d - 1
```
This change will cause the `dstOffset` variable to be one hour behind the `utcOffset`, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.d * 2
```
This change will cause the `dstOffset` variable to be twice the value of the `utcOffset`, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
