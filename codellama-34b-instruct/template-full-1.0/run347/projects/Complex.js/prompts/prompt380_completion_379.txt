  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the value of `b`, instead of the value of `b` when `a` is 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the value of `a`, instead of the value of `b` when `a` is 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add 1 to the value of `b`, instead of using the value of `b` when `a` is 0.

DONE.
