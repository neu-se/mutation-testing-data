Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the second argument from the original `args` to `null`, which means that the method will be invoked without any arguments, potentially leading to unexpected results or errors if the method expects arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get", [name, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the operation from `"post"` to `"get"`, which alters the intended method invocation to a property retrieval, likely resulting in incorrect behavior or errors if the method is not defined for the `"get"` operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [args, name]
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the positions of `args` and `name`, which could lead to the method being invoked with the wrong parameters, potentially causing the method to fail or behave incorrectly.

DONE.
