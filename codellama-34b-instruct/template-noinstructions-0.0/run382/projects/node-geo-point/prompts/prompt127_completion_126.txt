  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was expecting a GeoPoint object, but null would cause a null pointer exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new GeoPoint(0, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was expecting a GeoPoint object with non-zero coordinates, but a GeoPoint object with coordinates (0, 0) would cause the calculateDistance method to return 0, which is not the correct distance between the two points.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new GeoPoint(this.latitude, this.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was expecting a GeoPoint object with different coordinates, but a GeoPoint object with the same coordinates would cause the calculateDistance method to return 0, which is not the correct distance between the two points.

DONE.
