  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['NAN'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sign` method would always return NaN, rather than actually computing the sign of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['INFINITY'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sign` method would always return Infinity, rather than actually computing the sign of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['ZERO'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sign` method would always return zero, rather than actually computing the sign of the complex number.

DONE.
