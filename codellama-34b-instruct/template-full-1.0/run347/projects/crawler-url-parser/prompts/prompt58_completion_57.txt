  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the URL parsing function would think that the URL is invalid and skip processing it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.protocol != "http:"
```
This would result in different behavior because the URL parsing function would think that the URL is not an HTTP or HTTPS address and fail to parse it correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trim(parsedUrl.protocol + '://') != 'http://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the URL parsing function would think that the URL is not an HTTP or HTTPS address and fail to parse it correctly.

DONE.
