  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.reduce((acc, seg) => seg + acc, '$')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce()` method is called with a different initial value (`'$'` instead of `''`), which would cause the resulting regex to match differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.reduce((acc, seg) => seg + acc, '/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce()` method is called with a different initial value (`'/'` instead of `''`), which would cause the resulting regex to match differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.reduce((acc, seg) => seg + acc, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce()` method is called with no initial value (`''` instead of `'$'` or `'/'`), which would cause the resulting regex to match differently.

DONE.
