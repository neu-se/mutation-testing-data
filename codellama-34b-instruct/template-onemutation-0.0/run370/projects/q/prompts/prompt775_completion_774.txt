  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a promise for the given value. If `Q` is used in place of `Q.reject`, the promise will be fulfilled instead of rejected, which would cause the test to pass even if the code is incorrect.
