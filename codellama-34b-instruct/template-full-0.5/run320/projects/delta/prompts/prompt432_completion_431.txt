  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.ops[this.index + 1]` would return the next operation in the iterator, rather than the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.ops[this.index - 1]` would return the previous operation in the iterator, rather than the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.ops[0]` would always return the first operation in the iterator, regardless of the current index.

DONE.
