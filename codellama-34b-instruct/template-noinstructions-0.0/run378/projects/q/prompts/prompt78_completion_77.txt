  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Test error");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would call the `flush` function, while the new code fragment would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would call the `flush` function, while the new code fragment would return without calling the `flush` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would call the `flush` function, while the new code fragment would call the `flush` function twice.

DONE.
