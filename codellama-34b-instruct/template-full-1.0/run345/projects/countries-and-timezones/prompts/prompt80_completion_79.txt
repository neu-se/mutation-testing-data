  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"UTC"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `tzName` variable, which is a string that represents the name of a timezone. Replacing it with the string "UTC" would cause the function to always return the country associated with the UTC timezone, rather than the country associated with the specified timezone.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzName + "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would concatenate the `tzName` variable with the string "foo", resulting in a new string that is not a valid timezone name. The function would then return `null` instead of the expected country object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(tzName)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezone` function is called with the `tzName` variable as its argument, which means that the returned timezone object would be different than the one returned by the original code.
