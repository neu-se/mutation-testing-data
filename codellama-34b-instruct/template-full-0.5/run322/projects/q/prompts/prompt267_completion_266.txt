  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the reason, rather than calling the `reject` function with the reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(reject(reason));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the reason, rather than calling the `reject` function with the reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(fulfill(reason));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the reason, rather than calling the `reject` function with the reason.

DONE.
