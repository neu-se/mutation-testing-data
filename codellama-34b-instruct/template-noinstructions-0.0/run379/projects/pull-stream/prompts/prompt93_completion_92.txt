  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that takes two arguments, but the replacement code fragment `cb(null, data)` is a function call that takes only one argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that takes two arguments, but the replacement code fragment `cb(data)` is a function call that takes only one argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that takes two arguments, but the replacement code fragment `cb(null, null)` is a function call that takes two arguments, both of which are `null`.

DONE.
