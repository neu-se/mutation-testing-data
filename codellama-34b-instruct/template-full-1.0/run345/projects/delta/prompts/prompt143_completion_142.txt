  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
// return the length of the peeked operation
thisIter.peekLength();
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength` is a method that returns the length of the peeked operation, while `peek` returns the operation itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
// return the operation of the peeked length
thisIter.peek(thisIter.peekLength());
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek` takes a length argument, which is used to determine the length of the operation to be peeked.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
// return the length of the peeked operation
thisIter.peek().length;
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek` returns the operation itself, which has a `length` property that can be accessed to obtain the length of the operation.

DONE.
