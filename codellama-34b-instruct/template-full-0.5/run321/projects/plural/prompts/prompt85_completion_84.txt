  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mice', 'mice'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a new rule to the `plural` function, while this code fragment would replace an existing rule.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mice', 'mouses'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a new rule to the `plural` function, while this code fragment would modify an existing rule.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mice', 'mouse'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a new rule to the `plural` function, while this code fragment would remove an existing rule.

DONE.
