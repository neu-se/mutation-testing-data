  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mice'
```
This would result in different behavior because the plural of "mouse" is "mice," not "mouse."

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'houses'
```
This would result in different behavior because the plural of "house" is "houses," not "house."

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'feet'
```
This would result in different behavior because the plural of "foot" is "feet," not "foot."

DONE.
