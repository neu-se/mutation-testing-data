  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor()` returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given number, while `Math.round()` returns the nearest integer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil()` returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to a given number, while `Math.round()` returns the nearest integer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs()` returns the absolute value of a number, while `Math.round()` returns the nearest integer.

DONE.
