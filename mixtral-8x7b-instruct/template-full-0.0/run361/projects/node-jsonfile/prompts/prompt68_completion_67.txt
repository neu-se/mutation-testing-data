 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[\uFEFF]/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only remove the BOM marker if it's at the beginning of the string, instead of matching it as a standalone character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\uFEFF\u{FEFF}/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would require the BOM marker to appear twice in a row to be removed, which is unlikely and not what the original code intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[\u{FEFF}]/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the unicode property escape syntax, which is not supported in JavaScript regular expressions.

DONE.
