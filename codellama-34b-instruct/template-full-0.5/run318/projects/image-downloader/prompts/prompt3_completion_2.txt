  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The options.dest is required')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message is different from the original code fragment, which would make the test fail if the error message is not handled properly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The options.url is not a valid URL')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message is different from the original code fragment, which would make the test fail if the error message is not handled properly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The options.dest is not a valid path')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message is different from the original code fragment, which would make the test fail if the error message is not handled properly.

DONE.
