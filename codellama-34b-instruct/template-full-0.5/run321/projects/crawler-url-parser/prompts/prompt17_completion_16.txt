  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^#.*$/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `^` anchor matches the start of the string, whereas the original code fragment matches the end of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/g, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag causes the regular expression to match all occurrences in the string, whereas the original code fragment only matches the first occurrence.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is different from the original code fragment.

DONE.
