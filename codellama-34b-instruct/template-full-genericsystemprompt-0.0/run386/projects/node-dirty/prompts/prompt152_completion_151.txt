  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this._waitForDrain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the boolean value of `this._waitForDrain`, causing the `break` statement to be executed even if `this._waitForDrain` is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._waitForDrain === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, and `this._waitForDrain` is a boolean value, so it would never be equal to `false` even if it is `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._waitForDrain !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, and `this._waitForDrain` is a boolean value, so it would never be not equal to `true` even if it is `false`.

DONE.
