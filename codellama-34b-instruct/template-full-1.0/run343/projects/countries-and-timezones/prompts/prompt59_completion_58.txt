  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the +1 would cause the `getCountry` function to return a different country than the one requested, which could lead to unexpected results in the handling of country-related data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the -1 would cause the `getCountry` function to return a different country than the one requested, which could lead to unexpected results in the handling of country-related data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` 2 would cause the `getCountry` function to return a different country than the one requested, which could lead to unexpected results in the handling of country-related data.

DONE.
