  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `test` function, so `test(data)` would have the opposite result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data != test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `data != test(data)` checks if `data` is not equal to the result of the `test` function, whereas `!test(data)` checks if the result of the `test` function is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test(data) && data == test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `!test(data) && data == test(data)` checks if the result of the `test` function is falsy and `data` is equal to the result of the `test` function, whereas `!test(data)` only checks if the result of the `test` function is fals
