  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `error` is falsy, which would not be the case if it is replaced with `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `error` is truthy, which would not be the case if it is replaced with `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `error` is falsy, which would not be the case if it is replaced with `NaN`.

DONE.
