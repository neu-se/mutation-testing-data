  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_value = value; value = null; cb(null, _value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is called with `null` as the first argument, which is different from the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_value = value; value = null; cb(false, _value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is called with `false` as the first argument, which is different from the original code fragment.

DONE.
