  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op]()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is not called, which could lead to a different execution path or result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op].call(null, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` context is set to `null` instead of the `descriptor` object, which could affect the behavior of the method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op].apply(null, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` context is set to `null` instead of the `descriptor` object, which could affect the behavior of the method. Additionally, the `apply` method is used instead of `call`, which could also affect the behavior.

DONE.
