  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ms * 2, error
```
This would result in different behavior because the timeout would be doubled, causing the promise to be rejected later than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ms / 2, error
```
This would result in different behavior because the timeout would be halved, causing the promise to be rejected sooner than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error, ms
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments would be swapped, causing the promise to be rejected with the wrong error message.

DONE.
