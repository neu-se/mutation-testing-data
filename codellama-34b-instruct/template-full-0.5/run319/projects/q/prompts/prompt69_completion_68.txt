  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port1.postMessage
```
This would result in different behavior because `port1` is a different port than `port2`, and `postMessage` would be called on a different port than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port2.postMessage(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `postMessage` would be called with a different argument than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port2.postMessage("hello")
```
This would result in different behavior because `postMessage` would be called with a different argument than the original code.

DONE.
