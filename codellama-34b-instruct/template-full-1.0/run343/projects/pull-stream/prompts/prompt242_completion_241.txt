  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as the `data` parameter instead of the original `data` value, which could cause the `test` function to return a different result, potentially leading to a test failure.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `0` value would be passed as the `data` parameter instead of the original `data` value, which could cause the `test` function to return a different result, potentially leading to a test failure.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty string value would be passed as the `data` parameter instead of the original `data` value, which could cause the `test` function to return a different result, potentially leading to a test failure.

DONE.
