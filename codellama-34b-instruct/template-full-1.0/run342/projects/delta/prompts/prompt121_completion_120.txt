  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the operation would always be 0, which would break the logic of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the operation would always be Infinity, which would cause the code to loop indefinitely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the operation would always be -1, which would cause the code to skip over the current operation.

DONE.
