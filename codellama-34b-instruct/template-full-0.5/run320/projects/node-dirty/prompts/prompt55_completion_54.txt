  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `close` method to be called twice, which could lead to an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `close` method to be called with an error, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `close` method to be called before all data has been written to the stream, which could lead to data loss.

DONE.
