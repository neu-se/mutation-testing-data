  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value is not a valid argument for the `resolve` method of the `deferred` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value is not a valid argument for the `resolve` method of the `deferred` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"test"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string `"test"` is not a valid argument for the `resolve` method of the `deferred` object.

DONE.
