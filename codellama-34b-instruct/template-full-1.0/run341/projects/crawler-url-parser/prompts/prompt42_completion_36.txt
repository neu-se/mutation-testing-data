  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr + 'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a` character would be appended to the `baseUrlStr`, potentially changing the URL that is parsed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace('http', 'https')
```
This would result in different behavior because the scheme of the URL would be changed from `http` to `https`, potentially affecting the parsing of the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.split('/')[0] + '/' + baseUrlStr.split('/')[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the path of the URL would be modified, potentially affecting the parsing of the URL.

DONE.
