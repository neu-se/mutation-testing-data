  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject, op, args
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method will cause the promise to be rejected, rather than resolved, which could cause any code that is waiting for the promise to be resolved to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve, "foo", args
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` method will cause the promise to be resolved with the value "foo", rather than the value of `op`, which could cause any code that is waiting for the promise to be resolved to receive the wrong value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve, "bar", args
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` method will cause the promise to be resolved with the value "bar", rather than the value of `op`, which could cause any code that is waiting for the promise to be resolved to receive the wrong value.

DONE.
