  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment appends "ves" to the word, while the new code fragment appends "s" to the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'es'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment appends "ves" to the word, while the new code fragment appends "es" to the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'i'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment appends "ves" to the word, while the new code fragment appends "i" to the word.

DONE.
