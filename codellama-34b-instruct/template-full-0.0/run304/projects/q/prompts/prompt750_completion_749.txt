  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `pendingCount` is equal to 0, which means that all promises have been resolved or rejected. By changing it to `pendingCount > 0`, the code will enter the `if` block if there are still pending promises, which means that the `deferred.reject` method will be called, causing the promise to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `pendingCount` is equal to 0, which means that all promises have been resolved or rejected. By changing it to `pendingCount < 0`, the code will enter the `if` block if there are no pending promises, which means that the `deferred.resolve` method will be called, causing the promise to be resolved.
