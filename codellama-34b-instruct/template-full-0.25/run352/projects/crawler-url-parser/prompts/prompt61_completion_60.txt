  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.parse` returns a URL object, while `URL.format` returns a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.resolve` resolves a relative URL to an absolute URL, while `URL.format` returns a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument of `URL.parse` is a boolean that indicates whether to parse the query string. Setting it to `false` would result in a different object being returned.

DONE.
