  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would replace the element at position `index` with a new element, rather than inserting a new element at that position.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would insert a new element at position `index` and remove `index + 2` elements from the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would insert a new element at position `index` and remove `index + 1` elements from the array.

DONE.
