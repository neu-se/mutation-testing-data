  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c
```
This would result in different behavior because `c` is a variable name, and `Math.abs` is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d
```
This would result in different behavior because `d` is a variable name, and `Math.abs` is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a + b` is an expression that evaluates to a different value than the original `Math.abs`.

DONE.
