  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(reject(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because `become` is called with a rejected promise, which would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas the original code calls `become` with a resolved promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(fulfill(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because `become` is called with a fulfilled promise, which would cause the promise to be fulfilled, whereas the original code calls `become` with a resolved promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(Q(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because `become` is called with a promise that is resolved with the value `value`, whereas the original code calls `become` with a resolved promise.

DONE.
