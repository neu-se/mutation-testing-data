  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var attempt1 = /at .+ \((.+):(\d+):(?:\d+)\)$/.exec(stackLine);
if (attempt1.length > 0) {
    return [attempt1[1], Number(attempt1[2])];
}
```
This would result in different behavior because `exec()` would always return an array, but `attempt1` would be `null` when there is no match.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var attempt1 = /at .+ \((.+):(\d+):(?:\d+)\)$/.exec(stackLine);
if (attempt1[1] === undefined || attempt1[2] === undefined) {
    return;
}
return [attempt1[1], Number(attempt1[2])];
```
This would result in different behavior because `attempt1` would be an empty array instead of `null` when there is no match.
