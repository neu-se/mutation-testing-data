  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).nfapply(args).then(function () {
    throw new Error("Something went wrong");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with an error, even if the original code fragment resolved successfully.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).nfapply(args).then(function () {
    return Q.reject("Something went wrong");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a specific error message, even if the original code fragment resolved successfully.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).nfapply(args).then(function () {
    return Q.resolve("Something went wrong");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with a specific value, even if the original code fragment rejected with an error.

DONE.
