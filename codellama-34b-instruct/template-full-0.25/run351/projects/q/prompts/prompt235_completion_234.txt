  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[args]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` variable is not defined in the current scope, and would cause a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first element of the `args` array, which could potentially change the behavior of the `promiseDispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat([1, 2, 3])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add three additional elements to the `args` array, which could potentially change the behavior of the `promiseDispatch` method.

DONE.
