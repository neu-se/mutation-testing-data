 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === 0 && this['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for explicit equality of the real and imaginary parts to zero, instead of checking if the object is zero using the `isZero` method. This could lead to incorrect results when the `Complex` object has a very small non-zero value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks the real part of the `Complex` object, ignoring the imaginary part. This could lead to incorrect results when the imaginary part is not zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(this).length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the object has no properties, instead of checking if the `Complex` object's real and imaginary parts are both zero. This could lead to incorrect results when the `Complex` object has other
