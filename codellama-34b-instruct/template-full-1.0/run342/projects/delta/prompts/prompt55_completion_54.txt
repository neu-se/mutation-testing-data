  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof(ops) === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `ops` variable is a string, which is the opposite of the original condition that checks if it is an array. If the `ops` variable is a string, it would pass the condition and the code would execute, potentially causing unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the length of the `ops` array is zero, which is the opposite of the original condition that checks if it is not empty. If the `ops` array is empty, it would pass the condition and the code would execute, potentially causing unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops instanceof Array
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `instanceof` operator to check if the `ops` variable is an instance of the `Array` constructor, which is the opposite of the
