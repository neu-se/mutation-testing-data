  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty.call(object, 'latitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.hasOwnProperty` is a function that checks if the property exists on the object, but `object.hasOwnProperty.call(object, 'latitude')` would check if the property exists on the object and is enumerable, which may produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(object, 'latitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty` is a function that checks if the property exists on the object, but `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(object, 'latitude')` would check if the property exists on the object and is enumerable, which may produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty.bind(object, 'latitude')
```
