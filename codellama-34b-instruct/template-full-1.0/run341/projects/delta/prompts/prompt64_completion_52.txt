  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.push(newOp);
this.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would be called twice, resulting in the `newOp` being added to the `ops` array twice.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.push({ insert: 0 });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would be called with a `newOp` with an `insert` value of `0`, which would not add the `newOp` to the `ops` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would be called on the `ops` array directly, which would add the `newOp` to the array even if the `push` method on the `Delta` object is not called.

DONE.
