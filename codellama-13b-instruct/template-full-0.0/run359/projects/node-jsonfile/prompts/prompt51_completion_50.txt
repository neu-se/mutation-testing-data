  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(obj, replacer, spaces)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stringify` function would be called with the `replacer` and `spaces` arguments, which would cause the function to behave differently than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(obj, null, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stringify` function would be called with the `replacer` argument set to `null` and the `spaces` argument set to `2`, which would cause the function to behave differently than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(obj, null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stringify` function would be called with the `replacer` argument set to `null` and the `spaces` argument set to `null`, which would cause the function to behave differently than the original code.

DONE.
