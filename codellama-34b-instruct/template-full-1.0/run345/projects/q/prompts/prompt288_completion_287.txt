  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(Q(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve()` expects a value, not a promise. Passing a promise to `deferred.resolve()` would result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(fulfill(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill()` is a function that returns a promise, and passing that promise to `deferred.resolve()` would result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(reject(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject()` is a function that returns a promise, and passing that promise to `deferred.reject()` would result in an error.

DONE.
