  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, so `apply` would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an object, not a function, so `apply` would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because `function(){}` is a function with no arguments, so `apply` would throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
