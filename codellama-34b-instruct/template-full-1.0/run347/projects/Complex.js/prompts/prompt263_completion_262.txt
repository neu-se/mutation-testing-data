  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan3
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan3` is not a built-in JavaScript function and would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(b, a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments to `Math.atan2` have been swapped, which would cause the function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan(b, a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan` is the arctangent function, not the arctangent2 function, and would therefore return a different result.

DONE.
