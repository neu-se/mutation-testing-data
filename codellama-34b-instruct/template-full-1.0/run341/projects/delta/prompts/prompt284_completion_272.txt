  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\n'
```
This would result in different behavior because `\n` escaped backslash is counted as a single character. However, `\` is a printed backslash, so the correct replacement is `'\\n'` which has single slash escaped which is printed as `\\n`. This only replaces the variant in the parameter's type annotation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\n'
```
This would result in different behavior because '\n' is tipically \n is the escape sequence for newlines, while '\' is a single backslash. Thus, replacing it with '\' would result in a newline.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'hello'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'hello' is a string and wont match the parameter's type annotation.

DONE.
