  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the reference to the `promise` variable, which is used to track the rejection of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the reference to the `unhandledRejections` array, which is used to track the rejection of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the reference to the `promise` variable, which is used to track the rejection of the promise, and it would also remove the reference to the `unhandledRejections` array, which is used to track the rejection of the promise.

DONE.
