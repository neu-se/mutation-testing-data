 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
iter.next(index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the next character after the index instead of the character at the index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
iter.previous()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would move the iterator to the previous operation instead of the next one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
iter.skip(index)
