  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
adjust(this.longitude)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code fragment, but it uses the `adjust` function to modify the `longitude` property of the `GeoPoint` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
adjust(this.latitude)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code fragment, but it uses the `adjust` function to modify the `latitude` property of the `GeoPoint` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
adjust(this.longitude + this.latitude)
```
This code fragment is different from the original code fragment, as it adds the `longitude` and `latitude` properties of the `GeoPoint` object before passing them to the `adjust` function.

DONE.
