  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(args, "throw");
```
This would result in different behavior because `args` is not a function, and calling `bind` with it will throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(null, "throw");
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an instance of `continuer`, and calling `bind` with it will create a new function that throws a `TypeError` when called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(undefined, "throw");
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not an instance of `continuer`, and calling `bind` with it will create a new function that throws a `TypeError` when called.

DONE.
