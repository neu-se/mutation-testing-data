  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback()
```
This would result in different behavior because `callback()` is a function call, whereas `callback` is a reference to the function itself, and may be used to pass the function as an argument to another function or to assign it to a variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that represents the absence of any object value, whereas `callback` is a reference to a function object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because `true` is a boolean value that represents a condition that is always met, whereas `callback` is a reference to a function object that may or may not be called depending on the context in which it is used.

DONE.
