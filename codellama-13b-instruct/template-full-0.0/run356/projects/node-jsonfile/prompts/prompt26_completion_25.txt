  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.reviver.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method is called on the `reviver` function, which would return a string representation of the function, rather than the function itself. This could cause the `JSON.parse()` method to fail if the `reviver` function is not a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.reviver.call(this, key, value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call()` method is called on the `reviver` function, which would invoke the function with the specified `this` value and arguments. This could cause the `JSON.parse()` method to fail if the `reviver` function is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.reviver.apply(this, [key, value])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply()` method is called on the `re
