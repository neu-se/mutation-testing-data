  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
doneLackingErr()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `doneLackingErr` function, which is not defined in the `(PLACEHOLDER)` block, and would likely cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a null value to the `console.warn` method, which would likely cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an undefined value to the `console.warn` method, which would likely cause an error.

DONE.
