  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a function that resolves the promise, while `reject` is a function that rejects the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('Timeout Error')
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is a statement that throws an error, while `reject` is a function that rejects the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return
```
This would result in different behavior because `return` is a statement that returns a value from a function, while `reject` is a function that rejects the promise.

DONE.
