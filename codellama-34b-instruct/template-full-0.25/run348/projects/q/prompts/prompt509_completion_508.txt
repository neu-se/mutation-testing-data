  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method expects a `this` argument, and passing `null` would cause the function to be called with the global object as its `this` value, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method expects a `this` argument, and passing `undefined` would cause the function to be called with the global object as its `this` value, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method expects a `this` argument, and passing `this` would cause the function to be called with the current object as its `this` value, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
