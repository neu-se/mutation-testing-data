  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.delete` is a property that represents the number of characters to delete, whereas `otherOp` is an object representing the operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.retain` is a property that represents the number of characters to retain, whereas `otherOp` is an object representing the operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.insert` is a property that represents the string to insert, whereas `otherOp` is an object representing the operation.

DONE.
