  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `arguments` object, which is not null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `arguments` object, which is not undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `arguments` object, which is not an empty array.

DONE.
