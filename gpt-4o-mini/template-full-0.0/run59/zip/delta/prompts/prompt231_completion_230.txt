Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it increases the length used for the operation by 1, potentially causing an out-of-bounds error or incorrect operation when trying to access elements from `thisIter`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(otherIter.peekLength(), length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the maximum of the two lengths instead of the minimum, which could lead to attempting to process more elements than available in `otherIter`, resulting in unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the operation length to zero, effectively skipping the operation entirely, which could lead to incorrect results in the delta computation as no operations would be processed.

DONE.
