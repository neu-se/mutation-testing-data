  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2
```
This would result in different behavior because `φ2` is the longitude of the second point, while `φ1` is the latitude of the first point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2
```
This would result in different behavior because `λ2` is the longitude of the destination point, while `φ1` is the latitude of the first point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance
```
This would result in different behavior because `distance` is the distance between the two points, while `φ1` is the latitude of the first point.

DONE.
