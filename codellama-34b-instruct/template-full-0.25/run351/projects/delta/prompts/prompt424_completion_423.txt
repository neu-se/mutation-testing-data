  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'insert' && (offset <= index || !priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `<` instead of `<=` in the second condition, which could cause the `index` to be incremented by one more than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'insert' && (offset >= index || !priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `<` instead of `>=` in the second condition, which could cause the `index` to be decremented by one more than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'insert' && (offset !== index || !priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `<` instead of `!==` in the second condition, which could cause the `index` to be incremented or decremented by one more than intended.

DONE.
