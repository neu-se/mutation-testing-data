  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\r/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression matches carriage returns instead of line feeds, which could lead to incorrect parsing of the JSON string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\r?\n/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression matches both carriage returns and line feeds, which could lead to incorrect parsing of the JSON string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[\r\n]+/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression matches one or more occurrences of either carriage returns or line feeds, which could lead to incorrect parsing of the JSON string.

DONE.
