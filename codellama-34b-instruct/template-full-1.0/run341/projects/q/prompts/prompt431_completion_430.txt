  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.inspect
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the `isRejected` function return a function instead of a boolean value, which would cause the function to always return a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the `isRejected` function return the promise object instead of a boolean value, which would cause the function to always return a fulfilled promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return !this.inspect
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the `isRejected` function return the opposite of what it should be doing, so it would return `true` when the promise is fulfilled and `false` when it is rejected.

DONE.
