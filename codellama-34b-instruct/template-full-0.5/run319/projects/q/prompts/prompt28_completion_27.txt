  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `domain` variable is not defined, which would cause an error when trying to access its `exit` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `domain` variable is null, which would cause an error when trying to access its `exit` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task, "domain"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `domain` variable is a string, which would cause an error when trying to access its `exit` method.

DONE.
