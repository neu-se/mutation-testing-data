  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength()` returns the length of the current operation, whereas `peekType()` returns the type of the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter` is an iterator over the `other` delta's operations, whereas `thisIter` is an iterator over the current delta's operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the lengths of the current operation in both iterators, whereas the original code only adds the length of the current operation in `thisIter`.

DONE.
