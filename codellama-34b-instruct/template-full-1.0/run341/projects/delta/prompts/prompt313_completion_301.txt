  Option 1:
```
op.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.insert` accesses the insert property of the `op` object, whereas `op.delete` accesses the delete property.

Option 2:
```
!op.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the semantics of the code by inverting the `insert` property, which is a boolean.

Option 3:
```
op.insert + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the value of the `insert` property, which is a number, by adding 1 to it.

DONE.
