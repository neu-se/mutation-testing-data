  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `onFulfilled` and `onRejected` are two different functions, and the promise would be resolved with the result of `onRejected` instead of `onFulfilled`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onProgress
```
This would result in different behavior because `onFulfilled` and `onProgress` are two different functions, and the promise would be resolved with the result of `onProgress` instead of `onFulfilled`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
noop
```
This would result in different behavior because `noop` is a function that does nothing, and the promise would be resolved with the result of `noop` instead of `onFulfilled`.

DONE.
