  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.once
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.once` is an event listener that is triggered only once, whereas `output.on` is an event listener that is triggered every time the event occurs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.off
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.off` is used to remove an event listener, whereas `output.on` is used to add an event listener.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.emit
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.emit` is used to emit an event, whereas `output.on` is used to add an event listener.

DONE.
