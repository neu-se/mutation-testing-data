  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true for any positive number, even if the retain property is not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(op.retain) === Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return true for the specific value of Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER, rather than any positive number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain = '1234'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the length function to return the length of the string '1234', rather than the length of the original retain property.

DONE.
