  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not the same as the original `\u0000` character, and it may not be handled correctly by the code that processes the diffs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as the original `\u0000` character, and it may not be handled correctly by the code that processes the diffs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\u0001'
```
This would result in different behavior because `\u001` is not the same as the original `\u0000` character, and it may not be handled correctly by the code that processes the diffs.

DONE.
