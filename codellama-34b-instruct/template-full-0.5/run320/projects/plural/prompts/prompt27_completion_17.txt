  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return the length of the word minus 2, while the new code fragment would return the length of the word minus 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return the length of the word minus 2, while the new code fragment would return the length of the word plus 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return the length of the word minus 2, while the new code fragment would return the length of the word multiplied by 2.

DONE.
