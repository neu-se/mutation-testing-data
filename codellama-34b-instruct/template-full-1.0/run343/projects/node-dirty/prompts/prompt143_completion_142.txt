  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error('Duplicate key')
```
This would result in different behavior because a new error with the message "Duplicate key" would be emitted, while the original code fragment would emit the error object passed as an argument to the callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because no error would be emitted, while the original code fragment would emit the error object passed as an argument to the callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain', undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the "drain" event would be emitted, while the original code fragment would not emit this event.

DONE.
