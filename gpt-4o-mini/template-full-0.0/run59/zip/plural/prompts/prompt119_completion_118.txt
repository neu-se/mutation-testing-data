Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/s$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches any word that ends with 's', which is broader than the original regex that specifically matches words ending with 'ics'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^a-z]ics$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it requires that there be a non-letter character before 'ics', which would exclude valid words like 'mathematics' and 'statistics' that should match the original regex.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'g' (global) flag changes the matching behavior, potentially allowing for multiple matches in a string, which is not the intended behavior of the original regex that only checks for a single match at the end of the string.

DONE.
