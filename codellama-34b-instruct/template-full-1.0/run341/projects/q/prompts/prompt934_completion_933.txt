  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because NaN is not a function, so `apply` would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because null is not a function, so `apply` would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, so `apply` would throw an error.

DONE.
