  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process === "object" && typeof process.emit === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because `process` is an object, so `process === "object"` would always be false, and the condition would never be satisfied.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process === "function" && typeof process.emit === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because `process` is not a function, so `typeof process === "function"` would always be false, and the condition would never be satisfied.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process === "undefined" && typeof process.emit === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because `process` is not undefined, so `typeof process === "undefined"` would always be false, and the condition would never be satisfied.

DONE.
