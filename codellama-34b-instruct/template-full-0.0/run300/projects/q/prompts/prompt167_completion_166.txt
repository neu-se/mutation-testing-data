  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1; i < lines.length; ++i
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at index 1 instead of 0, and would skip the first line of the stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i <= lines.length; ++i
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, and would try to access an index that is out of bounds.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i < lines.length - 1; ++i
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one less time, and would skip the last line of the stack trace.

DONE.
