  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` method is called with an argument of `true`, which means that the promise will be resolved immediately. In the original code, the `defer` method is called without any arguments, which means that the promise will be resolved only when the `resolve` method is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` method is called with an argument of `false`, which means that the promise will never be resolved. In the original code, the `defer` method is called without any arguments, which means that the promise will be resolved only when the `resolve` method is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` method is called with an argument of `null`, which means that the promise
