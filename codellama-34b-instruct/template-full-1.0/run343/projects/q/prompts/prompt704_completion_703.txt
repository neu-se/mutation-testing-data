  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
while(true);
```
This would result in an infinite loop, causing the program to freeze and never complete.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.shift();
```
This would remove the first element from the array, which could cause the code to fail if it relies on the first element being present.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length = 0;
```
This would empty the array, which could cause the code to fail if it relies on the array having specific elements.

DONE.
