  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.label
```
This would result in different behavior because `label` is not a property of a promise object, whereas `inspect` is. With this replacement, the code would raise a `TypeError`, resulting in the failure of the `when` promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise["value"]
```
This would result in different behavior because `value` is not a property of a promise object, whereas `inspect` is. With this replacement, the code would raise a `TypeError`, resulting in the failure of the `when` promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a function that resolves a promise, whereas `inspect` is a property that represents the state of a promise. With this replacement, the code would cause an infinite loop, causing the `when` promise to never resolve.

DONE.
