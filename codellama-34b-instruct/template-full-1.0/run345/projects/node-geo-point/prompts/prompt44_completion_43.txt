  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 - r
```
This would result in different behavior because the `acos` function is used to calculate the angular distance between two points on the surface of a sphere, and replacing it with `1 - r` would give the opposite angle.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r + 0.1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `acos` function is used to calculate the angular distance between two points on the surface of a sphere, and replacing it with `r + 0.1` would give a slightly different angle.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * r
```
This would result in different behavior because the `acos` function is used to calculate the angular distance between two points on the surface of a sphere, and replacing it with `2 * r` would give twice the angle.

Note: The `rad2deg` function is used to convert the calculated angle from radians to degrees.

DONE.
