  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is no longer being passed directly to the `cb` function, but rather a modified version of it. This could cause the function to behave differently, especially if the `cb` function is expecting a specific value for the `end` parameter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is no longer being passed directly to the `cb` function, but rather a modified version of it. This could cause the function to behave differently, especially if the `cb` function is expecting a specific value for the `end` parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end * 2
```
