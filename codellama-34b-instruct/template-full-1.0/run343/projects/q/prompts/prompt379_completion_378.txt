  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
5
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a function as the input parameter, but `5` is a constant and not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a function as the input parameter, but `"hello"` is a string and not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is calling the `then` method on the `promise` object, but the replaced code would call the `tap` method instead.

DONE.
