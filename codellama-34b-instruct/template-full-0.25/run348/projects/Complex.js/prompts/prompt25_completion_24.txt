  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is equivalent to `1 + b * b`, which is a sum of two positive numbers, while the new code fragment is a difference of two positive numbers, which could result in a negative value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is equivalent to `1 + b * b`, which is a sum of two positive numbers, while the new code fragment is a sum of two positive numbers plus one, which could result in a larger value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is equivalent to `1 + b * b`, which is a sum of two positive numbers, while the new code fragment is a sum of two positive numbers divided by two, which could result in a smaller value.

DONE.
