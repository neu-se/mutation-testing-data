  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
busy
```
This would result in different behavior because the `busy` variable is always true when the `map` function is called, so the `read` function would never be called with the `abort` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!busy && abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` argument would only be passed to the `read` function if the `busy` variable is false, which would cause the `read` function to be called with the `abort` argument even if the `map` function has not completed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
busy || abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` argument would be passed to the `read` function if the `busy` variable is true or if the `abort` argument is passed to the `asyncMap` function.

DONE.
