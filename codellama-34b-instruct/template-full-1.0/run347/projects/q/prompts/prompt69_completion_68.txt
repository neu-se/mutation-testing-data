  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a function to be passed to `port1.onmessage`, but `0` is not a function and would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a function to be passed to `port1.onmessage`, but `null` is not a function and would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a function to be passed to `port1.onmessage`, but an empty function would not cause an error, but it would also not do anything when called.

DONE.
