  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`/${part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$1')}/`
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only replaces the first occurrence of the pattern, while this new code fragment replaces all occurrences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`/${part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$1')}/`
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only replaces the pattern if it is preceded by a forward slash, while this new code fragment replaces the pattern regardless of what precedes it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`/${part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$1')}/`
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only replaces the pattern if it is followed by a forward slash, while this new code fragment replaces the pattern regardless of what follows it.

DONE.
