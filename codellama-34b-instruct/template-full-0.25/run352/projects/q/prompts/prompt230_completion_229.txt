  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op === "when" && !operands[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the boolean value of `operands[1]`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `operands[1]` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op === "when" && operands[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `operands` array only has two elements, so `operands[2]` would be `undefined`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `operands[1]` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op === "when" && operands[1] === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator would check for strict equality between `operands[1]` and `false`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` only if `
