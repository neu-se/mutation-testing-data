Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` instead of `null` can lead to unexpected results in JavaScript, particularly in how the `apply` method interprets the arguments, potentially causing errors or different behavior in the function execution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.length
```
This would result in different behavior because using `ref.length` instead of `null` would pass the length of the `ref` array as the first argument to `pull`, which could lead to incorrect handling of the arguments and potentially cause runtime errors or unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `read` instead of `null` would change the first argument of the `pull` function to the value of `read`, which could alter the flow of data processing and lead to incorrect results or behavior in the function's execution.

DONE.
