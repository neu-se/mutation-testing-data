  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, str, options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because the `encoding` property is not being passed to the `fs.writeFileSync` method, which could cause issues if the file is not encoded correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, str, options.mode
```
This would result in different behavior because the `mode` property is not being passed to the `fs.writeFileSync` method, which could cause issues if the file is not written with the correct permissions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, str, options.flag
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flag` property is not being passed to the `fs.writeFileSync` method, which could cause issues if the file is not written with the correct flags.

DONE.
