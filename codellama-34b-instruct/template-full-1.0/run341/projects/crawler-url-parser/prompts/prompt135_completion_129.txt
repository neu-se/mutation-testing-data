  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(1)` would remove the first character of the `linkurl_path` string, while `replace` would replace the first occurrence of the regex pattern with an empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.split('/').join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `split` would split the `linkurl_path` string into an array of substrings using the forward slash as a delimiter, and then `join` would join the array elements using an empty string as a delimiter, effectively removing all forward slashes from the `linkurl_path`. While `replace` would replace all occurrences of the regex pattern with an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.match(/\/[^\/]*/g)
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` would return an array of all sub
