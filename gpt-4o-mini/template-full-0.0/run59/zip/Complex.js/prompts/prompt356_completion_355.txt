Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it alters the input to the `sin` function, effectively changing the output of the `cosh` calculation by adding a constant to the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the argument of the `sin` function from the imaginary part `b` to the real part `a`, which will yield a different result for the `cosh` calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the argument of the `sin` function to zero, which would always return zero, thus affecting the output of the `cosh` calculation regardless of the values of `a` and `b`.

DONE.
