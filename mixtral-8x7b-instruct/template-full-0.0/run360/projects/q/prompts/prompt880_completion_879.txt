 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { throw new Error("Fake node resolver"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it throws an error instead of creating a node resolver.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it always rejects the promise instead of resolving it with the node resolver.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return { resolve: function () {}, reject: function () {} }; }
