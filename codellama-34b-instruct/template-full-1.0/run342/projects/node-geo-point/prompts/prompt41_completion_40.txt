  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the latitude of the second point instead of the first point, which could lead to inaccurate calculation of the bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1Rad - point2Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the bearing between the two points as a difference instead of a ratio, which could lead to inaccurate calculation of the bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan(point1Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the tangent of the latitude of the first point instead of the ratio of the longitude and latitude, which could lead to inaccurate calculation of the bearing.

DONE.
