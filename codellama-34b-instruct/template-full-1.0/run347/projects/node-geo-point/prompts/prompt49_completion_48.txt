  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(-(point2.latitude)-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting expression would have a negative value, which would cause the calculation of φ2 to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(point2.latitude+360)
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting expression would have a different value than the original φ2 calculation, which would cause the calculation of θ to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(Math.PI/2-point2.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting expression would have a different value than the original φ2 calculation, which would cause the calculation of θ to be incorrect.

DONE.
