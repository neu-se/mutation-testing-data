  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * cosφ1
```
This change will cause the calculation of λ2 to be incorrect, resulting in a different destination point than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y * sinφ1
```
This change will cause the calculation of λ2 to be incorrect, resulting in a different destination point than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * sinφ1
```
This change will cause the calculation of λ2 to be incorrect, resulting in a different destination point than the original code.

DONE.
