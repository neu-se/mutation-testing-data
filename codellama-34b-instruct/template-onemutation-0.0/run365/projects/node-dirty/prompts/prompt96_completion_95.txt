  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!row.hasOwnProperty('key')
```
This would result in different behavior because `!('key' in row)` checks if the property 'key' is in the object `row`, while `!row.hasOwnProperty('key')` checks if the object `row` has its own property 'key', which may not be the same if the property is inherited from a prototype.
