  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object)["finally"](callback)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function is called with the wrong context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object)["finally"](callback.bind(object))
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function is called with the wrong context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object)["finally"](function() { return callback.apply(object, arguments); })
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function is called with the wrong context.

DONE.
