  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cosm1(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cosm1(b)` is not a valid method in JavaScript, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(b) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos(b) - 1` would return a different value than `Math.cosm1(b)` for the same input `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(b + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos(b + 1)` would return a different value than `Math.cosm1(b)` for the same input `b`.

DONE.
