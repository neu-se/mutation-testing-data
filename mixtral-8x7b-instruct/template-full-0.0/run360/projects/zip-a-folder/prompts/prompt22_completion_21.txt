 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream
```
This would result in different behavior because the optional chaining operator (`?.`) would return `undefined` if `zipAFolderOptions` is `null` or `undefined`, instead of throwing an error. This change would not check if `zipAFolderOptions` is truthy before trying to access its `customWriteStream` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
zipAFolderOptions && zipAFolderOptions.customWriteStream || fs.createWriteStream('default.zip')
```
This would result in different behavior because if `zipAFolderOptions` is falsy, it would create a new `WriteStream` with the filename 'default.zip' instead of throwing an error. This change would introduce a default write stream when none is provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
(zipAFolderOptions as any).customWriteStream
```
This would result in different
