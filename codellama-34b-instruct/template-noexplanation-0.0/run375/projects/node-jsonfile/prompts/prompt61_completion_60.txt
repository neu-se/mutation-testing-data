  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Buffer.isBuffer(content)
```
This code fragment is a function call to the `isBuffer` method of the `Buffer` class, which checks if the provided argument is a buffer. This is different from the original code fragment, which was simply a reference to the `Buffer.isBuffer` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.isBuffer
```
This code fragment is a reference to the `isBuffer` property of the `content` object. This is different from the original code fragment, which was a function call to the `isBuffer` method of the `Buffer` class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Buffer.isBuffer(content.toString())
```
This code fragment is a function call to the `isBuffer` method of the `Buffer` class, passing the result of calling `toString()` on the `content` object as an argument. This is different from the original code fragment, which was simply a reference to the `Buffer.is
