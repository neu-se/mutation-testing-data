  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.finally(function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function in `finally` would be executed immediately after the promise is resolved or rejected, rather than after a subsequent promise is resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function in `then` would be executed after the promise is resolved or rejected, rather than immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.catch(function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function in `catch` would be executed after the promise is rejected, rather than after a subsequent promise is resolved.

DONE.
