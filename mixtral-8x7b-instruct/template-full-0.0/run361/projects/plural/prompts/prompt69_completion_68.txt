 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'xeno', 'xenos'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original rule was for a specific string, while this new rule is a more general pattern that would incorrectly pluralize words like "xenon".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'criterion', 'criterions'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original rule had a special case for the word "criterion", while this new rule would always add an "s" to the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/^(man)$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'e') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original rule only replaced the "a" with an "e" if the word was "man" or "woman", while this new rule would replace the "a" with an "e" for any word that matches the regular expression.
