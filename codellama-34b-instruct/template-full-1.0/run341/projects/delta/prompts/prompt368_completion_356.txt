  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekType` method is called, but the `peek` method should be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekType(otherIter)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekType` method is called with the wrong argument, and the `otherIter` argument should be passed to the `peek` method instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[otherIter.index()].type
```
This would result in different behavior because the `type` property of the wrong object is being accessed.

DONE.
