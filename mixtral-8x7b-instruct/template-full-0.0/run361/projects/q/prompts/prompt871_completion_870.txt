 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nfapply` method expects a arguments array, and providing an empty array would cause the callback to be called with no arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nfapply` method expects a arguments array, and providing `null` would cause the callback to be called with `null` as the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
123
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nfapply` method expects a arguments array, and providing a number would cause the callback to be called with that number as the first argument.

DONE.
