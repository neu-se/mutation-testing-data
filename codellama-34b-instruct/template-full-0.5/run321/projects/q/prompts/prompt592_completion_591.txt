  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `arguments` object, which contains the values of the arguments passed to the function. By replacing it with a fixed array, the function would always receive the same arguments, regardless of how it was called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `arguments` object, which contains the values of the arguments passed to the function. By replacing it with `null`, the function would receive no arguments, regardless of how it was called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Array(1, 2, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `arguments` object, which contains the values of the arguments passed to the function. By replacing it with a new array, the function would receive a new array as its arguments, regardless of how it
