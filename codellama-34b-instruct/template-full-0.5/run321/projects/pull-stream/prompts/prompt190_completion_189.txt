  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map == null
```
This would result in different behavior because `map == null` would check if the `map` variable is null or undefined, while `!map` would check if the `map` variable is falsy (i.e., null, undefined, 0, false, etc.).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `map.length === 0` would check if the `map` variable is an empty array, while `!map` would check if the `map` variable is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map.hasOwnProperty('length')
```
This would result in different behavior because `map.hasOwnProperty('length')` would check if the `map` variable has a `length` property, while `!map` would check if the `map` variable is falsy.

DONE.
