  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.close(this._writeStream);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the `close` method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.close(this._readStream);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the `close` method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.close(this._queue);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the `close` method to behave differently.

DONE.
