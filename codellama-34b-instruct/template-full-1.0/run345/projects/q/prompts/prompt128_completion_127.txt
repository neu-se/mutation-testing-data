  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.property
```
This would result in different behavior because .property is a valid identifier, but object[property] is not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.object
```
This would result in different behavior because key.object is not a valid identifier, while object[key] might be.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.property + key
```
This would result in different behavior because object.property + key has a different meaning than object[property + key].

DONE.
