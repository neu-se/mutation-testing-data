  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key` would be modified, leading to different data being written to the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `val` would be set to `undefined`, leading to different data being written to the stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `val` would be set to an empty string, leading to different data being written to the stream.

DONE.
