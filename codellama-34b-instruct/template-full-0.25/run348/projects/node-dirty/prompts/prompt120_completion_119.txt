  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the number of in-flight writes is less than or equal to zero, while the new code fragment checks if it is strictly less than zero. This could cause the code to behave differently in certain edge cases, such as when there are no in-flight writes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the number of in-flight writes is less than or equal to zero, while the new code fragment checks if it is strictly greater than zero. This could cause the code to behave differently in certain edge cases, such as when there are no in-flight writes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if
