  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `name` is falsy, while this new fragment checks if `name` is null specifically. This could cause the function to return a different value if `name` is null, which could in turn cause the tests to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `name` is falsy, while this new fragment checks if `name` is an empty string specifically. This could cause the function to return a different value if `name` is an empty string, which could in turn cause the tests to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.includes('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `name` is falsy, while this new fragment checks if `name` includes an empty string specifically. This could cause the function to
