  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would inverse the condition, i.e., if the complex number is not infinite, the code would not return NaN, which is incorrect behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the complex number is zero, which is not the intended behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return NaN, regardless of the value of the complex number.

DONE.
