  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch(void 0, "apply", [void 0, args]);
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a valid value in JavaScript, but it is not a valid value for the `target` parameter of the `dispatch` method. The `target` parameter is expected to be a function, and passing `void 0` would result in a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch(null, "apply", [null, args]);
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value for the `target` parameter of the `dispatch` method, but it is not a valid value for the `args` parameter. The `args` parameter is expected to be an array, and passing `null` would result in a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch(undefined, "apply", [undefined, args]);
```
This would result in different behavior
