  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'error' is a different event than 'load', and would cause the code to emit an error event instead of a load event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'close' is a different event than 'load', and would cause the code to emit a close event instead of a load event.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'drain' is a different event than 'load', and would cause the code to emit a drain event instead of a load event.

DONE.
