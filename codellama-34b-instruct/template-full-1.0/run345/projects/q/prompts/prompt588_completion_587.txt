  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("PLACEHOLDER not provided"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `Q.async` would return a rejected promise, causing any code that handles the returned promise to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `Q.async` would return a resolved promise with a value of `null`, which could cause any code that handles the returned promise to fail or produce unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("PLACEHOLDER not provided");
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `Q.async` would throw an error, causing any code that handles the returned promise to fail.

DONE.
