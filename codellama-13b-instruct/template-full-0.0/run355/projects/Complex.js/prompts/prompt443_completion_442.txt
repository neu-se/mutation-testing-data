  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
100
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `places` would be 100, which would cause the `Math.round` function to round the real and imaginary parts of the complex number to 100 decimal places, instead of the default 15 decimal places. This could potentially cause the `Complex` class to return incorrect results for certain inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `places` would be `Math.PI`, which is a mathematical constant representing the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. This would cause the `Math.round` function to round the real and imaginary parts of the complex number to a number of decimal places that is equal to the value of `Math.PI`, which is likely not what the developer intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.E
```
This would result in different
