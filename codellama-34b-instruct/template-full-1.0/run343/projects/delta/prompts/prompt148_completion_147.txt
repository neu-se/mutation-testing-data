  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta += thisIter.next(start - index);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is intended to return the next element in the iteration, which would not be the desired behavior in this case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta = new Delta(lastOp.insert);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` property is only defined for `Op` objects that represent insertions, and not for other types of operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta = new Delta(lastOp.length);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property is only defined for `Op` objects that represent insertions and deletions, and not for other types of operations.

DONE.
