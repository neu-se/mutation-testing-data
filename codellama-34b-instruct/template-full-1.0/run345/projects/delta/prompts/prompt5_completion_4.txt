  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keepNull
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keepNull` variable is now included in the attributes object, which was not present in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number(keepNull)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keepNull` variable is now treated as a number, which means that it will be coerced into a number when it is used in the `attributes` object. This could cause unexpected behavior if the variable is not intended to be numerically evaluated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keepNull.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keepNull` variable is now converted into a string before being included in the `attributes` object. This could cause unexpected behavior if the variable is not intended to be a string.

DONE.
