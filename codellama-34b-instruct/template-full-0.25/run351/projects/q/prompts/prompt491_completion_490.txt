  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
untrackRejection(this);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `untrackRejection` function with `this` as an argument, which is not the same as calling it with `rejection` as an argument, which is what the original code does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackRejection(this);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `trackRejection` function with `this` as an argument, which is not the same as calling it with `rejection` as an argument, which is what the original code does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
untrackRejection(rejection);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `untrackRejection` function with `rejection` as an argument, which is not the same as calling it with `this` as an argument, which is what the original code does.

DONE.
