  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.hasOwnProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasOwnProperty` checks if the object has the specified property as a direct property, whereas `has` checks if the object has the specified property, regardless of whether it is a direct property or inherited from the prototype chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.get
```
This would result in different behavior because `get` retrieves the value associated with the specified property, whereas `has` checks if the object has the specified property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.size
```
This would result in different behavior because `size` returns the number of elements in the map, whereas `has` checks if the object has the specified property.

DONE.
