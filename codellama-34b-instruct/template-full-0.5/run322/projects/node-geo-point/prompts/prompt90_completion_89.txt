  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(θ) * sinδ * cosφ1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `sin` function to compute the sine of the bearing angle, while the replaced code fragment uses the `sin` function to compute the sine of the latitude angle.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(θ) * sinδ * cosφ1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `cos` function to compute the cosine of the bearing angle, while the replaced code fragment uses the `cos` function to compute the sine of the latitude angle.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

sin(θ) * cosδ * cosφ1

DONE.
