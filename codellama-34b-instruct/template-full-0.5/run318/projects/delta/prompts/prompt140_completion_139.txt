  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' && thisIter.peekLength() <= firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekType()` method is not defined in the `OpIterator` class, and the `peekLength()` method is not defined in the `Delta` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'insert' && otherIter.peekLength() <= firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekType()` method is not defined in the `OpIterator` class, and the `peekLength()` method is not defined in the `Delta` class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'delete' && otherIter.peekLength() <= firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekType()` method is not defined in the `OpIterator` class, and the `peek
