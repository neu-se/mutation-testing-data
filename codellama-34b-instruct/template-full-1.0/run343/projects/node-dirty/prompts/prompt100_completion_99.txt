  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer}`);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would generate an error with a more specific message that includes the corrupted row, while the new code fragment would generate an error with a less specific message that only indicates the buffer being corrupted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${chunk}`);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would generate an error with a more specific message that includes the corrupted row, while the new code fragment would generate an error with a less specific message that only indicates the chunk being corrupted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(`No corrupted row at the end of the db, but still error`);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would generate an error with a different message,
