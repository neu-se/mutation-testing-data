  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodeURI
```
This would result in different behavior because `decodeURI` does not decode the entire URL, but only the pathname. This could cause the `basename` variable to be incorrect, leading to a different file name being used for the downloaded image.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodeURIComponent
```
This would result in different behavior because `decodeURIComponent` decodes the entire URL, including the query string. This could cause the `basename` variable to be incorrect, leading to a different file name being used for the downloaded image.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
encodeURIComponent
```
This would result in different behavior because `encodeURIComponent` encodes the entire URL, including the query string. This could cause the `basename` variable to be incorrect, leading to a different file name being used for the downloaded image.

DONE.
