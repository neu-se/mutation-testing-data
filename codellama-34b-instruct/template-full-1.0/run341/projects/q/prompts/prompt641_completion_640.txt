  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method is used to invoke a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided as an array, whereas the `post` method is used to invoke a method on an object with a given `this` value and arguments provided as an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is used to invoke a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided as an array, whereas the `post` method is used to invoke a method on an object with a given `this` value and arguments provided as an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"bind"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method is used to create a new function that, when called, will have a given `this` value and arguments provided as an array, whereas the `post` method is used to invoke a method
