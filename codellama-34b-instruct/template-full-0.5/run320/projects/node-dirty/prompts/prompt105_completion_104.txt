  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val
```
This would result in different behavior because the `row.val` property is not defined in the `row` object, and would return `undefined`. In contrast, `row.key` is defined and would return the value of the `key` property in the `row` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the `key` property plus 1, whereas `row.key` would return the value of the `key` property as is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the `key` property converted to uppercase, whereas `row.key` would return the value of the `key` property as is.

DONE.
