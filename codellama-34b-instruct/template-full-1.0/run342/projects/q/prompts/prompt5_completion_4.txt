  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"sun"
```
This would result in different behavior because "sun" is a different string than "promise" and would cause errors in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because 0 is a different value than "promise" and would cause errors in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
head
```
This would result in different behavior because head is a local variable in this function and its value would be undefined, causing errors.

DONE.
