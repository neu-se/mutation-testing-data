  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.sin` and `Math.cos` functions expect a numerical argument representing the angle of the complex number, but `0` is a constant value that would not change the behavior of the functions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a mathematical constant representing the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, and would change the behavior of the `Math.sin` and `Math.cos` functions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(Math.PI)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp` is a exponential function that would change the behavior of the `Math.sin` and `Math.cos` functions.

DONE.
