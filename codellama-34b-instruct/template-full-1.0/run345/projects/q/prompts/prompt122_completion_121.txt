  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_create(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new object with no prototype, whereas the original code creates a new object with the `object` prototype.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_create(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new object with `undefined` as its prototype, whereas the original code creates a new object with the `object` prototype.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_create('foo')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new object with the string `'foo'` as its prototype, whereas the original code creates a new object with the `object` prototype.

DONE.
