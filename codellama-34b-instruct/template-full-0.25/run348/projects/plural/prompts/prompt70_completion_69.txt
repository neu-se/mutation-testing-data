  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('cello', 'cello')
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the same word instead of the expected plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('cello', 'cellos')
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the same plural form as the original code fragment, but the word would be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('cello', 'cellos')
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the same plural form as the original code fragment, but the word would be different.

DONE.
