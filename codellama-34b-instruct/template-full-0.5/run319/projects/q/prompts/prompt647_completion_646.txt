  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method is used to invoke a method in a future turn, while the `get` method is used to get the value of a property in a future turn.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method is used to invoke a method in a future turn, while the `delete` method is used to delete a property in a future turn.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method is used to invoke a method in a future turn, while the `apply` method is used to apply a function in a future turn.

DONE.
