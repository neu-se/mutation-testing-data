  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.slice(0, unhandledReasons.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a copy of the `unhandledReasons` array with the last element removed, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.slice(1, unhandledReasons.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a copy of the `unhandledReasons` array with the first element removed, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.slice(2, unhandledReasons.length - 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a copy of the `unhandledReasons` array with the first and last elements removed, which may not be the desired behavior.

DONE.
