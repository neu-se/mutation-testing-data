  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object[callback].apply(callback);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object[callback]` syntax would return a reference to the `callback` function, while `callback.apply` syntax would attempt to call the `apply` method on the `callback` function, which would throw an error if `callback` is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"callback" + callback.apply;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would attempt to concatenate the string `"callback"` with the `apply` method reference, which would throw an error if `callback` is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(args);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` argument would be missing from the `apply` function call, which could potentially modify the behavior of the `callback` function.

DONE.
