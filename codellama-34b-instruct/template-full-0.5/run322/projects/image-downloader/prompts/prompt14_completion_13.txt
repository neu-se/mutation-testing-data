  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basename.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `basename` variable as-is, while this replacement would convert it to lowercase.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(basename)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `basename` variable as-is, while this replacement would return the directory name of the basename.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `basename` variable as-is, while this replacement would return the basename of the `options.dest` path.

DONE.
