  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^http(s)?:\/\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would remove the "http" or "https" protocol from the beginning of the URL, which could cause the URL to be parsed incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr + 'test'
```
This would result in different behavior because the "test" string would be appended to the end of the URL, which could cause the URL to be parsed incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/\//g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would remove all forward slashes from the URL, which could cause the URL to be parsed incorrectly.

DONE.
