  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if(!end) {
  sink(source)
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only call the `sink` function if the `end` variable is not truthy, whereas the original code calls `sink` regardless of the value of `end`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if(end === true) {
  sink(source)
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only call the `sink` function if `end` is equal to `true`, whereas the original code calls `sink` for any truthy value of `end`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if(acc === null) {
  sink(source)
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only call the `sink` function if the `acc` variable is `null`, whereas the original code calls `sink` for any truthy value of `end`.
