  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete(key);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits an event when the key is deleted, while this new code does not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code deletes the key from the map, while this new code sets the value associated with the key to null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, '');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code deletes the key from the map, while this new code sets the value associated with the key to an empty string.

DONE.
