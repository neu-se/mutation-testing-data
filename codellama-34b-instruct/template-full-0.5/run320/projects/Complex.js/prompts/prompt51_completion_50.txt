  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a['arg']` is finite, while this replacement checks if it is equal to zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Number.isFinite(a['arg'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a['arg']` is finite, while this replacement checks if it is not finite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg'] < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a['arg']` is finite, while this replacement checks if it is less than zero.

DONE.
