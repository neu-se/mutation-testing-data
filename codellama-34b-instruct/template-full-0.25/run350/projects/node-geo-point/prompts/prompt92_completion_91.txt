  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(θ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function is being called with the wrong argument. In the original code, `cos` is called with `θ`, which is the angle between the two points. However, in the mutated code, `cos` is called with `θ + 1`, which would result in a different angle and therefore a different bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(θ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function is being called with the wrong argument. In the original code, `sin` is called with `θ`, which is the angle between the two points. However, in the mutated code, `sin` is called with `θ + 1`, which would result in a different angle and therefore a different bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan(θ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tan` function is being called with the wrong
