  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the result of the `test` function, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when the `test` function returns `false`, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function would be called with the `data` argument, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when the `test` function returns `true`, and vice versa.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data) && data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` only when both the `test` function and the `data` argument are truthy, whereas the original code would evaluate to `true` when either the `test` function or the `data`
