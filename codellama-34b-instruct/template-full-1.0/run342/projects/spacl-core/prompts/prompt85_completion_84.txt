  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```(rule) => null```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method returns a new instance of the `Policy` class, whereas the new code fragment returns `null`, which would cause any code that relies on the return value of `clone` to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```(rule) => undefined```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method returns a new instance of the `Policy` class, whereas the new code fragment returns `undefined`, which would cause any code that relies on the return value of `clone` to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```(rule) => rule```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method returns a new instance of the `Policy` class, whereas the new code fragment returns the original rule, which would cause any code that relies on the return value of `clone` to behave differently.

DONE.
