  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || false, done || function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` variable is now always `false`, which means that the `read` function will never be called with `abort` set to `true`, even if the `abort` function is called with `true` as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || true, done || function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` variable is now always `true`, which means that the `read` function will never be called with `done` set to `false`, even if the `done` function is called with `false` as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || true, done || function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` and `done` variables are now always `true`, which means that the `read` function will never be called with `
