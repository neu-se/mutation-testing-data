  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(0)` creates a shallow copy of the `policies` array, which may not be intended in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.filter(policy => policy.name !== 'default')
```
This would result in different behavior because it filters out any policies with the name 'default', which may not be intended in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.map(policy => policy.name)
```
This would result in different behavior because it maps each policy to its name, which may not be intended in the original code.

DONE.
