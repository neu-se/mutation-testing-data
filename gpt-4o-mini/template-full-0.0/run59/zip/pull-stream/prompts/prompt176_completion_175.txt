Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause `Object.keys(null)` to throw a TypeError, which would not happen with the original code, potentially leading to unhandled exceptions in the application.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create an array of the length of the original array instead of its keys, leading to incorrect values being returned when iterating through the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the first element of the array instead of iterating through all elements, thus not providing the expected values from the entire array.

DONE.
