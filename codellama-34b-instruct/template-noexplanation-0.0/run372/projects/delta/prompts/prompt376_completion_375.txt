  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This change will cause the `transform` method to behave differently than the original code, as it will now consider `insert` operations as a different case than `delete` or `retain` operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This change will cause the `transform` method to behave differently than the original code, as it will now consider `retain` operations as a different case than `delete` or `insert` operations.
