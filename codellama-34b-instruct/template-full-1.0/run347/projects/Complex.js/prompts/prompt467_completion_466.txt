  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `b !== 0` would always return `true` if `a` is not `0`, even if `b` is `0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!a
```
This would result in different behavior because `!a` would always return `false` if `a` is not `0`, even if `b` is `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `a == 0` would always return `true` if `a` is `0`, even if `b` is not `0`.

DONE.
