  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `otherData`, which is an object with a `retain` property. In the original code, `typeof otherData === 'object' && otherData !== null` checks whether `otherData` is an object that is not `null`, but `null` would fail this check and skip the subsequent logic that uses `otherData`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
// This comment is a different value than otherData, as comments are not considered at runtime
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherData` would still be an object with a `retain` property, but the comment would not have that property and would likely cause errors in the subsequent logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value than `otherData`, which is an object with a `retain` property. In the
