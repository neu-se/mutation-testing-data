  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter.peekType()` method to be called twice, which could have unintended consequences if the method has side effects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter.peekType()` method to be called twice, which could have unintended consequences if the method has side effects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter.peekType()` method to be called twice, which could have unintended consequences if the method has side effects.

DONE.
