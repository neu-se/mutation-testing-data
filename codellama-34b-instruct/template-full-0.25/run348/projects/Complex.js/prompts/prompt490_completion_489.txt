```
Complex, "__esModule", { 'value': false }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `value` property would be set to `false`, indicating that the module is not an ES module, even if it is. This could cause issues with module loading and resolution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

```
Complex, "__esModule", { 'value': true, 'exports': { 'default': Complex } }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `exports` property would be set to an object with a `default` property that references the `Complex` constructor, even if the module has other exports. This could cause
