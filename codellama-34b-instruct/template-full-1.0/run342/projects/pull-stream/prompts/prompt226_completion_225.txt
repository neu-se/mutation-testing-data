  Option 1:
```
(data) => !test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used the `!` operator to invert the result of the `test` function, while this code uses the `!` operator on the `data` argument, which may not have the same effect.

Option 2:
```
(data) => !Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(data, 'test')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code called the `test` function with a `data` argument, while this code uses the `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty` method to check if the `test` property exists on the `data` object.

Option 3:
```
(data) => test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used the `!` operator to invert the result of the `test` function, while this code does not use the `!` operator.

DONE.
