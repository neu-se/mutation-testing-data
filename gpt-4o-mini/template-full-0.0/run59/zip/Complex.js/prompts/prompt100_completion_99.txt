Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '+' : '') + c
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the sign of the number being parsed from negative to positive when `minus` is odd, which could lead to incorrect parsing of complex numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + (c * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the parsed value by 2, effectively doubling the imaginary part of the complex number, which alters its intended value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(z['im'] + c)
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the current value of `c` to the imaginary part `z['im']`, rather than correctly parsing the value from the token, which could lead to incorrect results in the complex number representation.

DONE.
