  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"fakePromise", definition
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would never be resolved or rejected, causing the program to hang indefinitely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error", new Error("oops")
```
This would result in different behavior because the error would be thrown immediately, causing the program to exit with an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise", Q.delay(definition, 1000)
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved or rejected only after a delay of 1 second, which could cause the program to behave differently if it relies on the timing of the promise resolution or rejection.

DONE.
