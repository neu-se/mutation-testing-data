  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzName, options.deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `deprecated` property of the `options` object as the second argument to the `getCountryForTimezone` function, instead of passing the `options` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzName, options.timezones
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `timezones` property of the `options` object as the second argument to the `getCountryForTimezone` function, instead of passing the `options` object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzName, options.countries
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `countries` property of the `options` object as the second argument to the `getCountryForTimezone` function, instead of passing the `options` object itself.

DONE.
