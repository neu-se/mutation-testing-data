  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 to the value of `tokens[i + 1]` would cause the parser to treat the value as a number, rather than a string. This could potentially cause the parser to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 1 from the value of `tokens[i + 1]` would cause the parser to treat the value as a number, rather than a string. This could potentially cause the parser to produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication of 2 by the value of `tokens[i + 1]` would cause the parser to treat the value as a number, rather than a string
