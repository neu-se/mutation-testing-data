  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the order of operations in the expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the sign of the value being used in the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an additional term to the expression, which would change the overall result.

DONE.
