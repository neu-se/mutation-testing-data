  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.reviver = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` function is no longer called, which could cause issues if the JSON data contains custom data types or requires special handling.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.reviver = function(key, value) { return value; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` function is now a no-op, which could cause issues if the JSON data contains custom data types or requires special handling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.reviver = function(key, value) { throw new Error('Invalid JSON data'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` function now throws an error, which could cause issues if the JSON data is invalid or requires special handling.

DONE.
