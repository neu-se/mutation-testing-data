  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] - this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is now subtracting the imaginary part of `this` from the real part of `z`, instead of subtracting the real part of `this` from the real part of `z`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] * this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is now multiplying the real part of `z` by the imaginary part of `this`, instead of subtracting the real part of `this` from the real part of `z`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] / this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is now dividing the real part of `z` by the imaginary part of `this`, instead of subtracting the real part of `this` from the real part of `z`.

DONE.
