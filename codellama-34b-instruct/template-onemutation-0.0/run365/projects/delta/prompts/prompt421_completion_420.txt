  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `length` is a variable that represents the length of the current operation, while `0` is a constant that always evaluates to zero. In the context of the code, this change would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, resulting in a different behavior.

DONE.
