  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds elements to the beginning of an array, while `concat` creates a new array by combining the elements of two or more arrays.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds elements to the beginning of an array, while `slice` returns a subset of an array, starting from the index specified by the second parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds elements to the beginning of an array, while `pop` removes elements from the end of an array.

DONE.
