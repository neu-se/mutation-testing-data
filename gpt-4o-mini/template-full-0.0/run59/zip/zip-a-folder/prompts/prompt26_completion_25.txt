Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
format, {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it ignores the `archiverOptions` entirely, leading to the default options being used instead of any custom options provided by the user.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiverOptions || { level: 0 }
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the compression level to `0` (uncompressed) if no `archiverOptions` are provided, which may not be the intended behavior when a user expects the default compression level to be applied.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
format, { zlib: { level: 10 } }
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the compression level to `10`, which is outside the valid range for zlib compression levels (0-9), potentially causing an error or unexpected behavior during the compression process.

DONE.
