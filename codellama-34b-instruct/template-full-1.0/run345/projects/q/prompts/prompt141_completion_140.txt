  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p = p.source || null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code assumes that `p.source` is always truthy, while the modified code allows for the possibility that it may be falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p = p['source']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses dot notation to access the `source` property, while the modified code uses bracket notation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p = p.sourceline
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code accesses the `source` property, while the modified code accesses the `sourceline` property.

DONE.
