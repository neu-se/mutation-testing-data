  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `read` to be a function that takes no arguments, but if it's replaced with `null`, it will error out when trying to call `pull()` on it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `i` to be less than `length`, but if it's replaced with `length - 1`, it will skip the last iteration of the loop and not call `sink()` on the last argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read[i]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `read` to be a function that takes no arguments, but if it's replaced with `read[i]`, it will error out when trying to call `pull()` on a property of `read` that doesn't exist.

DONE.
