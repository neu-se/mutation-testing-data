  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because `parsedUrl` is the result of `URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, true)`, which is a different object than `parsedBaseUrl`, which is the result of `URL.parse(baseUrlStr, true, true)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseUrl` is the result of `URL.parse(baseUrlStr, true, true)`, which is a different object than `parsedUrl`, which is the result of `URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, true)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would parse the `currentUrlStr` string using the `URL` module, which is different from the `parsedBaseUrl` object that is being used in the original code.
