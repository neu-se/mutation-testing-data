  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(b, a) + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.atan2` function returns the angle in the range of -π to π, but adding `Math.PI` would shift the range to 0 to 2π.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(b, a) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.atan2` function returns the angle in the range of -π to π, but multiplying by 2 would double the range to -2π to 2π.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(b, a) / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.atan2` function returns the angle in the range of -π to π, but dividing by 2 would halve the range to -π/2 to π/2.
