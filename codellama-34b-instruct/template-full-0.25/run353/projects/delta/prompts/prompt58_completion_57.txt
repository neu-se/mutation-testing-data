  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray
```
This would result in different behavior because `!Array.isArray` would return `true` if `a` is not an array, while `Array.isArray` would return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.constructor === Array
```
This would result in different behavior because `a.constructor === Array` would check if `a` is an array, while `Array.isArray` would check if `a` is an array-like object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(a) === '[object Array]'
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString.call(a)` would return a string representation of `a`, while `Array.isArray` would return a boolean value indicating whether `a` is an array.

DONE.
