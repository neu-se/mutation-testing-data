  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the index file extension from the URL, while the new code fragment removes the entire index file from the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '/default'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the index file extension from the URL, while the new code fragment replaces the index file with the default file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '/default\.[a-z]+'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the index file extension from the URL, while the new code fragment replaces the index file with the default file and adds a new extension.

DONE.
