  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for both value and type equality, whereas the `!` operator only checks for value equality. In this case, `trackUnhandledRejections` is a boolean value, so using `===` would ensure that the value is both `false` and of type `boolean`, whereas using `!` would only check that the value is `false`, regardless of its type.
