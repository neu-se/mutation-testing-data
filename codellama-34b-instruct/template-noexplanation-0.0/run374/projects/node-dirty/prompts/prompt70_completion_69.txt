  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This will cause the `load` event to be emitted as `error`, which will trigger the `error` event handler and provide a different behavior than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain'
```
This will cause the `load` event to be emitted as `drain`, which will trigger the `drain` event handler and provide a different behavior than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This will cause the `load` event to be emitted as `close`, which will trigger the `close` event handler and provide a different behavior than the original code.

DONE.
