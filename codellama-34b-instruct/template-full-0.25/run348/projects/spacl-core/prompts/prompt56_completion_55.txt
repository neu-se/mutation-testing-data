  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.replace(/[a-zA-Z0-9_]/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove all alphanumeric characters and underscores from the `part` string, whereas the original code fragment only removes the first occurrence of a character that is not a dot or a slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.replace(/[a-zA-Z0-9_]/g, 'x')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace all alphanumeric characters and underscores with the letter "x", whereas the original code fragment only removes the first occurrence of a character that is not a dot or a slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.replace(/[a-zA-Z0-9_]/g, '\\$&')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace all alphanumeric characters and underscores with a backslash followed by the matched
