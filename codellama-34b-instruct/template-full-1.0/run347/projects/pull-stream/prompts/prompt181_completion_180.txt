  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, and the code would throw a `TypeError` when `abortCb` is called with `undefined` as the third argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, and the code would throw a `TypeError` when `abortCb` is called with `null` as the third argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because this is an empty function, and the `abortCb` function would not be called with the correct arguments.

DONE.
