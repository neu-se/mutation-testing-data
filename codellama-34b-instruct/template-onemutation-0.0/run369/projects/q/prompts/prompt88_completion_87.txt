  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[].concat(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments` is a special object that is only available within a function's scope, while `[].concat(arguments)` creates a new array that contains the same values as `arguments`, but is not the same object.

DONE.
