 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because it rounds up to the nearest whole number instead of rounding down. This could lead to incorrect offset strings being generated for timezones with negative UTC offsets.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns a positive number, even for negative inputs. This would cause the sign variable to be incorrect, resulting in incorrect offset strings being generated for timezones with negative UTC offsets.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
input => Math.floor(input / 60)
```
This would result in different behavior because it ignores the remainder when dividing by 60, whereas the original code fragment uses the modulo operator to calculate the minutes. This would cause the minutes to always be 0, resulting in incorrect offset strings being generated for timezones with non-zero minute offsets.

DONE.
