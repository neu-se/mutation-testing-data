  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `let` keyword to declare a variable, while the buggy code fragment uses the `=` operator to assign a value to the variable. In the buggy code fragment, the variable `currentUrl` is not declared, so it will be assigned the value `null` by default. This could cause the code to behave differently in certain situations, such as when the variable is used in a conditional statement or when it is passed as an argument to a function.
