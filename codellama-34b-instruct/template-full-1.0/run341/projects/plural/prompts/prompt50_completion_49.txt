  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]ode$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `o` at the end of the word is not being matched by the regex.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]o{2}$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex is now looking for two `o`s at the end of the word, not just one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]o{1,3}$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex is now looking for one to three `o`s at the end of the word, not just one.

DONE.
