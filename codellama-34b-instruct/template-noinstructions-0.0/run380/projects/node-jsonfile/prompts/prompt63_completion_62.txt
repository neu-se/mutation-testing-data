  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was calling the `toString` method on the `content` object, which would return a string representation of the object. However, if we replace it with `content.toString`, it would return a reference to the `toString` method itself, which is not what we want.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toString(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was calling the `toString` method with no arguments, which would return a string representation of the object in base 10. However, if we replace it with `content.toString(2)`, it would return a string representation of the object in base 2, which is not what we want.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toString(16)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was calling the `toString` method with no arguments, which would return a
