 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison of `linkurl_without_last_part` and `pageurl_without_last_part` would always be true if `pageurl_path` does not end with a slash, causing some internal links to be incorrectly classified as "samelevel".

This would result in different behavior because the comparison of `linkurl_without_last_part` and `pageurl
