  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a != 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!=` operator checks whether the two operands are not equal, while the `!==` operator checks whether they are not equal and not of the same type. In this case, if `a` is `0`, `a != 0` would evaluate to `false`, while `a !== 0` would evaluate to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator performs addition, while the `==` operator checks for equality. In this case, if `a` is `0`, `a + 1` would evaluate to `1`, while `a == 0` would evaluate to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator performs subtraction, while the `==` operator checks for equality. In this case
