  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.includes(text) && tmpUrl.text.includes(text)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking if the `text` variable is included in the `tmpUrl.text` property twice, which would always return `true` if `text` is not an empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.includes(text) || tmpUrl.text.includes(text)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking if the `text` variable is included in the `tmpUrl.text` property twice, but it would only return `true` if `text` is not an empty string and it is included in the `tmpUrl.text` property at least once.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.includes(text) && tmpUrl.text.includes(text)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking
