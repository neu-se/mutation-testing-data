Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve("An error occurred");
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of rejecting the promise with the error, it resolves the promise with a string message, which changes the expected outcome of the promise handling.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Custom error message"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it always rejects the promise with a new error object containing a fixed message, regardless of the original exception that occurred, thus losing the context of the actual error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it rejects the promise with a `null` value instead of an error object, which may lead to unexpected handling of the rejection in promise chains that expect an error.

DONE.
