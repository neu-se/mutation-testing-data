  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.concat(deferred.makeNodeResolver())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is passing the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function as the last argument to the `fapply` method, while the modified code fragment is passing the result of calling the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function as the last argument. This would cause the `fapply` method to be called with a different number of arguments, which could result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.slice(0, -1).concat(deferred.makeNodeResolver())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is passing the entire `nodeArgs` array as the last argument to the `fapply` method, while the modified code fragment is passing a subset of the `nodeArgs` array as the last argument. This could result in different behavior if the `fapply` method has side effects that depend on the number of arguments it is called with.

Option 3:
