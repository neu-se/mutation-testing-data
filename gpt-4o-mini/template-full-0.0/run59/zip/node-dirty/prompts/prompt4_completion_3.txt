Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data.clear()` removes all entries from the `_data` map, while `this._data.delete(key)` only removes the entry associated with the specified `key`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data.set(key, null)` sets the value of the specified `key` to `null`, rather than removing the key-value pair from the map entirely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete('nonExistentKey');
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data.delete('nonExistentKey')` attempts to delete a key that does not exist, which has no effect on the map, while `this._data.delete(key)` would remove the entry associated with the provided `key`.

DONE.
