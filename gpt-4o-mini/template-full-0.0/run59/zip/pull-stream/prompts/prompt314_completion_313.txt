Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `null` instead of `data` would cause the caller to receive a `null` value when the test fails, which may lead to unexpected handling of the result in the consuming code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `undefined` instead of `data` would indicate that no value is being returned, potentially causing the consuming code to misinterpret the result or lead to runtime errors if it expects a valid data object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because incrementing `data` by 1 would change the value being returned, which could lead to incorrect processing in the consuming code that relies on the original value of `data`.

DONE.
