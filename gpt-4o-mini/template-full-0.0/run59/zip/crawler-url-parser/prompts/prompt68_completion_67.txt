Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl = parse("http://example.com");
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the `baseUrl` to always be set to a specific URL ("http://example.com"), regardless of the actual `sourceUrl` provided, potentially leading to incorrect URL resolutions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl = parse(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets `baseUrl` to `null`, which would cause the subsequent URL parsing logic to fail when trying to resolve relative URLs, leading to unexpected results or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl = parse(sourceUrl + "/extra");
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends "/extra" to the `sourceUrl`, altering the base URL used for resolving relative links, which could lead to incorrect link extraction and categorization.

DONE.
