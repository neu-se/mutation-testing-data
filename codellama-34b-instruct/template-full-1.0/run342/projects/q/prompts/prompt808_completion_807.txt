  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.finally` method expects a promise as its first argument, and `NaN` is not a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.finally` method expects a promise as its first argument, and `Promise.resolve(object)` creates a new promise that resolves with `object`, which may not be the same promise that is passed to the `Q.finally` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.then(function () {
    throw Error("This is a bug");
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with an error message, which would not occur with the original code fragment.

DONE.
