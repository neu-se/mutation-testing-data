  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit(new Error('Something went wrong'));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits an event with no error, while this code fragment emits an error event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits an event with the `drain` event name, while this code fragment emits an event with a `null` event name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', new Error('Something went wrong'));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits an event with no error, while this code fragment emits an error event with the `drain` event name.

DONE.
