Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('write_complete');
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits a different event name ('write_complete') instead of 'write_close', which may not be handled by any listeners expecting the original event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('write_close', {status: 'success'});
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits the 'write_close' event with an additional object containing a status property, which changes the event's payload and may lead to different handling in the event listeners.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('write_close', this._writeStream);
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits the 'write_close' event with the write stream object itself as the payload, which could lead to different processing in the event listeners compared to emitting a simple event without any payload.

DONE.
