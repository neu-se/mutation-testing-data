Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because starting the index at 1 instead of 0 would cause the loop to skip the first token in the `tokens` array, potentially leading to incorrect parsing of the input string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = -1;
```
This would result in different behavior because initializing the index to -1 would cause the loop to not execute at all, as the condition `i < tokens.length` would be false from the start, resulting in no tokens being processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i < tokens.length; i += 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because incrementing `i` by 2 on each iteration would cause the loop to skip every other token, potentially leading to incorrect parsing of complex numbers, especially if they are represented with multiple terms.

DONE.
