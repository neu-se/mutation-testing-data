  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Corrupted row: ${rowStr}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, but the error would still be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Could not load corrupted row: ${rowStr}`, { code: 'E_CORRUPTED_ROW' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be the same, but the error code would be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Could not load corrupted row: ${rowStr}`, { code: 'E_CORRUPTED_ROW', row: rowStr })
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be the same, but the error code and the row data would be different.

DONE.
