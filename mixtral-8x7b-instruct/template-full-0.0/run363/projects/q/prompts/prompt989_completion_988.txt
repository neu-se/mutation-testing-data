 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `[].slice` is the native Array.prototype.slice method, while `array_slice` is an alias used in the provided code. Changing it could cause issues if the code relies on the non-standard `array_slice` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, and attempting to call it would throw a TypeError. This would expose any tests that do not properly handle exceptions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { return 42; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `array_slice` function with a function that always returns 42. This would expose tests that do not properly check the return values of the functions being tested.

DONE.
