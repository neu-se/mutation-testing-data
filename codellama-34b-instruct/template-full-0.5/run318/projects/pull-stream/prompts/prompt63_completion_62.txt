  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the `end` variable to `abort`, regardless of whether `end` was already truthy or not. This could cause the function to enter an infinite loop if `abort` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = !end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the `end` variable to the opposite of what it was before. This could cause the function to never exit the loop if `end` was already falsey.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = end && abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set `end` to `abort` only if `end` was already truthy. This could cause the function to exit the loop if `end` was already falsey, even if `abort` was truthy.

DONE.
