 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '++'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would require the input string to have two consecutive '+' signs, which is not present in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '1'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the character is the number '1' instead of the '+' sign.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c.charCodeAt(0) === 43
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the ASCII value of the character is 43 (which is the code for '+'), instead of directly comparing it with '+'.

DONE.
