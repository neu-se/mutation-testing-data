  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
loop = true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `loop` variable is set to `true` unconditionally, whereas in the original code, it is only set to `true` if `test(data)` returns `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is called with the `data` parameter, whereas in the original code, it is only called if `test(data)` returns `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(end, function (end, data) {
  if(test(data))
    cb(end, data)
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function is called with a different callback function that only calls `cb` if `test(data)` returns `true`.

DONE.
