  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filter.not
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter.not` function is not defined in the original code, and would cause a runtime error if called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filter.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter.test` function is not defined in the original code, and would cause a runtime error if called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filter.tester
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter.tester` function is not defined in the original code, and would cause a runtime error if called.

DONE.
