  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument is being passed instead of the first.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because an additional argument is being passed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because an additional argument is being passed.

DONE.
