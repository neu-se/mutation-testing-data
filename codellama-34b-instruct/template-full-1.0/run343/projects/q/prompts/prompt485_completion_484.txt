  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.slice(0, unhandledReasons.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a copy of the `unhandledReasons` array without the last element, instead of returning a copy of the array with all elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.slice(1, unhandledReasons.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a copy of the `unhandledReasons` array without the first and last elements, instead of returning a copy of the array with all elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.slice(0, unhandledReasons.length - 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a copy of the `unhandledReasons` array without the last two elements, instead of returning a copy of the array with all elements
