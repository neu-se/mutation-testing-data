  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x*x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `Math.exp` function, which computes the exponential function, while the new code uses `x*x`, which computes the square of `x`. This would cause the function to return a different value for the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x/2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `Math.exp` function, which computes the exponential function, while the new code uses `x/2`, which computes the half of `x`. This would cause the function to return a different value for the same input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x+1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `Math.exp` function, which computes the exponential function, while the new code uses `x+1`, which computes the sum of `x` and `1`. This would cause the
