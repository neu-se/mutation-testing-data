  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a*2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is adding the value of `a` to itself, while the modified code fragment is multiplying the value of `a` by 2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is adding the value of `a` to itself, while the modified code fragment is subtracting 1 from the value of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a+0.5
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is adding the value of `a` to itself, while the modified code fragment is adding 0.5 to the value of `a`.

DONE.
