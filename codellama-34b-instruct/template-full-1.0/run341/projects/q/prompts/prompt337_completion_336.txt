  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.reason !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspected.reason` is always undefined, so the branch will never be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state !== "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set `promise.exception` to `inspected.reason`, even for resolved promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state !== "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set `promise.exception` to `inspected.reason`, even for pending promises.

DONE.
