  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.retain` is always `true` when `otherOp.delete` is `true`, so the `if` statement would always be executed, even when it should not be.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.attributes` is an object that contains the attributes of the operation, and it is not equivalent to `otherOp.delete`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.insert` is a string that contains the text to be inserted, and it is not equivalent to `otherOp.delete`.

DONE.
