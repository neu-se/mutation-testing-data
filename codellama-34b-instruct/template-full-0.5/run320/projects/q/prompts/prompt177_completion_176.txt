  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` is a method that returns a boolean value indicating whether a string or substring exists in the string, while `indexOf` is a method that returns the position of the first occurrence of a specified value in a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.match
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is a method that returns an array of matches, while `indexOf` returns the position of the first occurrence of a specified value in a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` is a method that returns the position of the first occurrence of a specified value in a string, while `indexOf` returns the position of the first occurrence of a specified value in a string.

DONE.
