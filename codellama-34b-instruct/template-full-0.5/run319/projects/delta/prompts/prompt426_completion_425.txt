  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.delete === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.delete` is a number, but the new code checks if it's a string. This could cause the function to return the wrong value if `op.delete` is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.delete` is a number, but the new code checks if it's greater than 0. This could cause the function to return the wrong value if `op.delete` is a negative number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.delete` is a number, but the new code checks if it's undefined. This could cause the function to return the wrong value if `op.delete` is undefined.
