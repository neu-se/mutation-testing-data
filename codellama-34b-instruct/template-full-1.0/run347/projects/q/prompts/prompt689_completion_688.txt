  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call"
```
This would result in different behavior because the method "call" is different from "apply" and would not return the same result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"bind"
```
This would result in different behavior because "bind" returns a new function that, when called, applies the original function to the provided arguments in the order they were passed. It would not return the same result as "apply".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"length"
```
This would result in different behavior because "length" is a property that represents the number of arguments of a function. It would not return the same result as "apply".

DONE.
