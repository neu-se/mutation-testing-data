  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
head = {task: void 0, next: null};
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the initialization of the linked list, which is used to store tasks that need to be executed in the future.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tail = head;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the tail of the linked list, which is used to append new tasks to the list.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flushing = false;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the flushing flag, which is used to control whether the linked list is currently being flushed or not.

DONE.
