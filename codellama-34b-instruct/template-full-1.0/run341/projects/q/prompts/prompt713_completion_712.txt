  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
("promises", [])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `promises` method instead of the `keys` method, which could potentially return different values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
("keys", [1, 2, 3])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an array of numbers instead of an empty array, which could potentially cause the `keys` method to return different values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
("keys", ["a", "b", "c"])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an array of strings instead of an empty array, which could potentially cause the `keys` method to return different values.

DONE.
