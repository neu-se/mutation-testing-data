Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to retrieve one more operation than intended, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds error or incorrect operation being processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(opLength)
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses the `thisIter` iterator instead of `otherIter`, which would lead to processing operations from the wrong delta, resulting in incorrect diffs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it retrieves the length of the next operation without advancing the iterator, which could lead to incorrect handling of the delta operations and potentially skipping necessary operations.

DONE.
