  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid value for the `callback` argument, and would cause the `map` function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid value for the `callback` argument, and would cause the `map` function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"foo"` is not a valid value for the `callback` argument, and would cause the `map` function to throw an error.

DONE.
