  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sinh(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sinh(b)` is the hyperbolic sine function, which is different from the cosine function `Math.cos(b)` used in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cosh(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cosh(b)` is the hyperbolic cosine function, which is different from the sine function `Math.sin(b)` used in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tanh(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tanh(b)` is the hyperbolic tangent function, which is different from the tangent function `Math.tan(b)` used in the original code fragment.

DONE.
