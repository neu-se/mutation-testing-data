  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes.clone()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone()` method creates a deep copy of the `attributes` object, which could potentially lead to unexpected behavior if the `attributes` object is mutated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes.merge({})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `merge()` method merges the `attributes` object with an empty object, which could potentially overwrite or remove attributes that were present in the original object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes.get(op.insert)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get()` method retrieves the value of the `attrs` attribute on the `op` object, which may not be present or may have a different value than the `attributes` object used by the `inject()` method.

DONE.
