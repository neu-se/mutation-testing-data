  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start + index
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `start - index` would result in a negative value when `index` is greater than `start`, while the replacement code fragment `start + index` would result in a positive value in the same scenario.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start * index
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `start - index` would result in a negative value when `index` is greater than `start`, while the replacement code fragment `start * index` would result in a large positive value in the same scenario.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - start
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `start - index` would result in a negative value when `index` is greater than `start`, while the replacement code fragment `index - start` would result in a positive value in the same scenario.

DONE.
