  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
7
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return the last 7 characters of the string, instead of the last 8.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
6
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return the last 6 characters of the string, instead of the last 8.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
5
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return the last 5 characters of the string, instead of the last 8.

DONE.
