  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.regex.test(path)
```
This would result in different behavior because `test` is a method that checks if a pattern matches a string, whereas `this.regex` is a property that contains the pattern itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.match(this.regex)
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is a method that checks if a pattern matches a string, whereas `this.regex` is a property that contains the pattern itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.regex.exec(path)
```
This would result in different behavior because `exec` is a method that checks if a pattern matches a string and returns an array of matches, whereas `this.regex` is a property that contains the pattern itself.

DONE.
