 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'latitude' in object
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the presence of the 'latitude' property in the 'object' using the 'in' operator, which returns true even if the property is inherited or present in the object's prototype chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(object, 'latitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the 'call' method to explicitly invoke the 'hasOwnProperty' method on the 'object' prototype, which ensures that the check is performed only for the object's own properties and not its prototype chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Reflect.has(object, 'latitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the 'Reflect.has' method to check for the presence of the 'latitude' property in the 'object', which provides a more functional and consistent
