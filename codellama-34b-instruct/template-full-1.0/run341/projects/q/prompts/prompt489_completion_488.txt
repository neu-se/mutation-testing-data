  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resetUnhandledRejections` function is called with the argument `0`, which means that it will not remove any unhandled rejections from the `unhandledRejections` array. This could cause the `unhandledRejections` array to grow indefinitely, leading to potential memory issues.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections(Infinity);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resetUnhandledRejections` function is called with the argument `Infinity`, which means that it will remove all unhandled rejections from the `unhandledRejections` array. This could cause the `unhandledRejections` array to be emptied, potentially hiding bugs that rely on the presence of unhandled rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections(null);
