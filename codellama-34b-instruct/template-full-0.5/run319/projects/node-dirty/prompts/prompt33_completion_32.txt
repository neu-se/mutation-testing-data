  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value from `undefined`, and it would cause the `set` method to store a null value in the database, which may not be intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object, and it would cause the `set` method to store an empty object in the database, which may not be intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `set` method to store the current value of the `key` in the database, which may not be intended.

DONE.
