  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `x`, regardless of the value of `y`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + y
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the sum of `x` and `y`, rather than just `y`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return twice the value of `y`, rather than just `y`.

DONE.
