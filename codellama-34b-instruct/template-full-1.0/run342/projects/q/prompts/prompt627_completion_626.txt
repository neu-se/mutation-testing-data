  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete"
```
This would result in different behavior because "delete" is a reserved word in JavaScript, and using it as a property name could cause issues with the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"replace"
```
This would result in different behavior because "replace" is a method name in JavaScript, and using it as a property name could cause issues with the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"newSet"
```
This would result in different behavior because "newSet" is a unique property name that is not used in the code, so it would not cause any issues.

DONE.
