  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return timezones;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `deliverTimezones` filters out deprecated timezones, while the new code fragment simply returns all timezones.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return timezones.filter(tz => !tz.deprecated);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `deliverTimezones` filters out deprecated timezones, while the new code fragment filters out timezones that are not deprecated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return timezones.filter(tz => tz.deprecated);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `deliverTimezones` filters out deprecated timezones, while the new code fragment filters out timezones that are deprecated.

DONE.
