  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i++], null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of `array[i++]` as the first argument to `cb`, while this modified code fragment returns `null` as the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i++], undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of `array[i++]` as the first argument to `cb`, while this modified code fragment returns `undefined` as the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i++], array[i++]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of `array[i++]` as the first argument to `cb`, while this modified code fragment returns the value of `array[i++]` twice, which could cause the callback to be called with the same value twice.

DONE.
