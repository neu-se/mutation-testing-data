 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
a[key] || b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the value of `a[key]` if it's not null or undefined, otherwise it would use the value of `b[key]`. The original code uses the value of `b[key]` only if `a[key]` is equal to `b[key]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
b[key] || a[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the value of `b[key]` if it's not null or undefined, otherwise it would use the value of `a[key]`. The original code uses the value of `b[key]` only if `a[key]` is equal to `b[key]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
(a[key] as any) || b[key]
