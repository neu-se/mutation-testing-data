  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']()
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the `isNaN()` method instead of `isInfinite()`. This could potentially cause the `toString()` method to return a different value than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']()
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the `isFinite()` method instead of `isInfinite()`. This could potentially cause the `toString()` method to return a different value than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']()
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the `!` operator to negate the result of the `isInfinite()` method. This could potentially cause the `toString()` method to return a different value than expected.

DONE.
