  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[value]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `value` property is not necessarily the same as the `key` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key + "xyz"]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key` property is now concatenated with the string "xyz", which could potentially cause issues in the surrounding code if it assumes that the resulting value is a valid key in the object being accessed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key` property is now set to `undefined`, which could potentially cause issues in the surrounding code if it assumes that the resulting value is a defined key in the object being accessed.

DONE.
