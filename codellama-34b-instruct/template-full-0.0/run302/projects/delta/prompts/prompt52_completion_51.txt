  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is a different variable than `b`, and it may not have the same properties or methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[index - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.ops[index - 1]` is a different object than `b`, and it may not have the same properties or methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp` is a different object than `b`, and it may not have the same properties or methods.

DONE.
