  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.matches(path, ctx) && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&& false` would always return `false`, even if the `rule.matches(path, ctx)` returned `true`. This would cause the `matches` method to always return `false`, even if the `path` and `ctx` match the rule.

DONE.
