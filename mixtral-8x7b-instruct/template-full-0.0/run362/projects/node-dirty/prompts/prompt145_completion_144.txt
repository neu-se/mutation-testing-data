 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
global.process.emit
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits the 'drain' event at the global process level instead of the current instance of Dirty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('invalid_event')
