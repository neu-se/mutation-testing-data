  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the diff algorithm would be comparing the wrong strings, leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0].reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the diff algorithm would be comparing the reversed version of the first string, leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0].toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the diff algorithm would be comparing the lowercase version of the first string, leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
