  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops != null && ops.ops.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ops` is an array, while the new code fragment checks if `ops.ops` is an array. If `ops` is an object with an `ops` property that is not an array, the new code fragment would return `true`, while the original code fragment would return `false`.
