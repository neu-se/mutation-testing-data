  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method that returns a promise, whereas `tap` is a method that returns the original promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).thenResolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `thenResolve` is a method that returns a promise that is resolved with the given value, whereas `tap` is a method that returns the original promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).thenReject
```
This would result in different behavior because `thenReject` is a method that returns a promise that is rejected with the given reason, whereas `tap` is a method that returns the original promise.

DONE.
