 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce a division by zero error, while `isNaN` returns a boolean value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to true, while `isNaN` checks if the value is not a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sqrt(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce an imaginary number, while `isNaN` checks if the value is not a number.

DONE.
