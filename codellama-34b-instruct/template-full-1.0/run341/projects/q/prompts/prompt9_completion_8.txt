  Option 1: The `<PLACEHOLDER>` can be replaced with: `typeof define === "undefined" && define.amd`
This would result in different behavior because it would check whether the `define` is undefined and if it is, it would create a new property called `amd` on it. The original code fragment was checking whether `define` is a function and if it is, it would check whether `define.amd` exists.

Option 2: The `<PLACEHOLDER>` can be replaced with: `typeof define === "object" && define.amd`
This would result in different behavior because it would check whether `define` is an object and if it is, it would check whether `define.amd` exists. The original code fragment was checking whether `define` is a function and if it is, it would check whether `define.amd` exists.

Option 3: The `<PLACEHOLDER>` can be replaced with: `typeof define === "function" && define.amd && define.amd()`
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `define` function with no arguments and check whether `define.amd
