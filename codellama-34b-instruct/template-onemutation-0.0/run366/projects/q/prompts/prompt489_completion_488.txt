  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections([]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment called `resetUnhandledRejections` with no arguments, while the new code fragment calls it with an empty array as an argument. This could potentially cause the `untrackRejection` function to be called with a different argument, which could affect the behavior of the program.

DONE.
