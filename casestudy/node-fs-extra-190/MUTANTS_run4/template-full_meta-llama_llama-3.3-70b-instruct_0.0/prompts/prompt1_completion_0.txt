Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.existsSync(srcFile)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the existence of the source file instead of the destination file, potentially leading to incorrect handling of file copying.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!fs.existsSync(destFile)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the non-existence of the destination file, inverting the original logic and potentially causing issues when trying to overwrite existing files.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
destFile.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the length of the destination file path string instead of its existence on the file system, which could lead to incorrect decisions about whether to clobber or throw an error.

DONE.
