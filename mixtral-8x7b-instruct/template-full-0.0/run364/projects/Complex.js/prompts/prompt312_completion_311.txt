 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned Complex object would have a different value for the real part, which is supposed to be `Math.cos(a) * cosh(b)` in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would lead to division by zero when `a` is equal to zero, while the original code fragment `a` would not cause such an issue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause exponential growth or decay based on the value of `a`, while the original code fragment `a` does not have this effect.

DONE.
