  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fallback` function would be called with `null` as the first argument, which would lead to a different execution path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fallback` function would be called with `undefined` as the first argument, which would lead to a different execution path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fallback` function would be called with `"foo"` as the first argument, which would lead to a different execution path.

DONE.
