  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isNodeJS` variable to be set to `true` in a browser environment, where it should be `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isNodeJS` variable to be set to `false` in a Node.js environment, where it should be `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "undefined" && typeof process === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isNodeJS` variable to be set to `true` in a browser environment, where it should be `false`.

DONE.
