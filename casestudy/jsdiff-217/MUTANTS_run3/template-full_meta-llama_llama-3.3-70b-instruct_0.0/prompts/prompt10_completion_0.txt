Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
value.match
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` returns an array containing the match and its groups, whereas `split` returns an array of substrings separated by the specified separator, potentially leading to different tokenization results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
value.replace
```
This would result in different behavior because `replace` returns a new string with the specified replacement, whereas `split` returns an array of substrings, changing the data type and structure of the output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
value.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` returns a shallow copy of a portion of the string, whereas `split` returns an array of substrings separated by the specified separator, potentially leading to different tokenization results and data types.

DONE.
