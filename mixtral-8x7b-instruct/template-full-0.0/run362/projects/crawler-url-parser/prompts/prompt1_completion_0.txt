 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/[^a-z0-9\:\/\?\#\[\]\@\!\$\&\'\(\)\*\+\,\;\=\.\-\_\~\%]/.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the negated character class is now unescaped, changing the meaning of the regular expression. It would match any string containing a character not in the set `a-z`, `0-9`, `:`, `/`, `?`, `#`, `[`, `]`, `@`, `!`, `$`, `&`, `'`, `(`, `)`, `*`, `+`, `,`, `;`, `=`, `.`, `-`, `_`, `~`, or `%`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new RegExp('[^a-z0-9\\:\\/\\?\\#\\[\\]\\@\\!\\$\\&\\'\\(\\)\\*\\+\\,\\;\\
