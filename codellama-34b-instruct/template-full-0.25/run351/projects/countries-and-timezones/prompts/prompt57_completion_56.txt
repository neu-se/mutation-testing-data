  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the country object, even if it doesn't exist in the `countries` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!timezones[id]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the timezone with the given `id` exists in the `timezones` object, rather than checking if the country with the given `id` exists in the `countries` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] && countries[id].timezones
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the country with the given `id` exists in the `countries` object and if it has any timezones, rather than just checking if the country exists.

DONE.
