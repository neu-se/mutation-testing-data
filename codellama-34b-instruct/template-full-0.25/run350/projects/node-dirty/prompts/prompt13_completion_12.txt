  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cbs.includes(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `includes` method checks if the callback is already in the list, and if it is, it will not add it again, which could cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property returns the number of elements in the list, and if it is 0, it means the list is empty, and the callback will not be added to the list, which could cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.indexOf(cb) === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `indexOf` method returns the index of the first occurrence of the callback in the list, and if it is -1, it means the callback is not in the list, and it will be added, which could cause the test to fail.
