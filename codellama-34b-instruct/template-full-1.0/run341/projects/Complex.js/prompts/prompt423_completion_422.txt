  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of `isInfinite()`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if the value is not infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN()` checks if a value is not a number, and if the value is NaN, the `if` statement would evaluate to `true`, even if the value is not infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would only check the real part of the complex number, and if the real part is not zero, the `if` statement would evaluate to `true`, even if the imaginary part is infinite.

DONE.
