  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0 && a > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the program to always return the complex conjugate of the input, regardless of the input's imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0 && b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the program to always return the complex conjugate of the input, regardless of the input's real part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === b && Math.sqrt(a^2 + b^2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the program to always return a complex number with a positive imaginary part, regardless of the input's imaginary part.

DONE.
