  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned `null`, while `undefined` would be returned if the `test` function did not return a truthy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned `null`, while `false` would be returned if the `test` function did not return a truthy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned `null`, while `NaN` would be returned if the `test` function did not return a truthy value.

DONE.
