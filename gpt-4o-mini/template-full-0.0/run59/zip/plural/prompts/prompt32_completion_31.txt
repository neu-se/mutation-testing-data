Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly removes only the last character instead of the last two characters, leading to incorrect pluralization for words like "thesis" and "crisis".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis/i, function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends 's' to the word instead of the correct plural form 'es', which would produce incorrect results for "thesis" and "crisis".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly changes the pluralization rule to use 'ies' instead of 'es', which is not the correct plural form for "thesis" and "crisis".

DONE.
