  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to skip over the last operation in the delta, potentially resulting in incorrect behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate one extra time, potentially resulting in an infinite loop or incorrect behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate twice as many times as it should, potentially resulting in incorrect behavior.

DONE.
