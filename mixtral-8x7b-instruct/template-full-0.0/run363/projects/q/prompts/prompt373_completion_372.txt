 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
console.error
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.error` does not have the same behavior as `Q.onerror`. `Q.onerror` is a function that is called when an unhandled error occurs in a promise, while `console.error` is used to log error messages to the console.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function and will throw a `TypeError` when called. This would cause the promise to be rejected, while the original code would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty function does not have the same behavior as `Q.onerror`. An empty function will not handle any unhandled errors in a promise, while `Q.onerror` is designed to do so.

DONE.
