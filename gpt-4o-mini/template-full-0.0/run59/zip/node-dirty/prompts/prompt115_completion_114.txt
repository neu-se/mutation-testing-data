Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.size + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly adds 1 to the size of the data, which would lead to an inaccurate representation of the actual size.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to access a `length` property, which does not exist on the `_data` object (assuming it's a Map or similar), leading to an undefined value instead of the actual size.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.keys().length
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to get the length of the keys iterator instead of the size of the `_data`, which may not accurately reflect the number of entries in the data structure.

DONE.
