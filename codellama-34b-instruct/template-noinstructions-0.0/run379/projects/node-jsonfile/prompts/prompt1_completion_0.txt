  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false`, even if `options` is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.toString() === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false`, even if `options` is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.constructor === String
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false`, even if `options` is a string.

DONE.
