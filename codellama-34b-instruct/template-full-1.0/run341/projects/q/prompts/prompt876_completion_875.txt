  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(< (typeof object) === "Function" ? object : this ).delay(timeout)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was using `this` inside the `Promise.prototype.delay` method, which would refer to the `Promise` object. By replacing it with `(< (typeof object) === "Function" ? object : this )`, we are saying that if `object` is a function, we use it as the context for the `delay` method, otherwise we use the original `this` context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(< (typeof object) === "Function" ? object : () => { return this }))().delay(timeout)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was using `this` inside the `Promise.prototype.delay` method, which would refer to the `Promise` object. By replacing it with `(< (typeof object) === "Function" ? object : () => { return this }))()`, we are saying that if
