Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses the latitude of `point2` instead of `point1`, leading to an incorrect calculation of the distance between the two points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1Rad + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the latitude in radians of `point1`, which would skew the distance calculation, resulting in an incorrect distance value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it mistakenly uses the longitude of `point1` instead of the latitude in radians, which would completely disrupt the distance calculation logic.

DONE.
