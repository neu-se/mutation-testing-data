  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.reverse().join
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, which would cause the stack trace to be output in reverse order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.slice(1).join
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice(1)` method returns a new array containing all the elements of the original array except the first one, which would cause the stack trace to start from the second line instead of the first.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.splice(1, 1).join
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice(1, 1)` method removes the second element of the array, which would cause the stack trace to start from the third line instead of the second.

DONE.
