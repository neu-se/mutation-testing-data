 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `switch` statement would always take the `default` branch, even when the length of `ref` is 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `switch` statement would always take the branch corresponding to the length of `ref`, even when the length is greater than 4.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(Math.random() * length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `switch` statement would take a random branch, rather than the branch corresponding to the length of `ref`.

DONE.
