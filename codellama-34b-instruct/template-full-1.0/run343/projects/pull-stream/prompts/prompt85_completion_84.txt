  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the truthiness of `cb` before using it as a function, while this change would always use `cb` as a function, even if it's falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the truthiness of `abort` before using it as a value, while this change would always use `abort` as a value, even if it's falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (err, cb) { return err; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls `cb` with no arguments, while this change would call `cb` with two arguments, which could potentially change the behavior of the program.

DONE.
