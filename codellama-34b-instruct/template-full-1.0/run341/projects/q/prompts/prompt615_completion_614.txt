  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"PLACEHOLDER"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a string with the value "PLACEHOLDER" instead of the object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first element of the object instead of the object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.someProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the property "someProperty" of the object instead of the object itself.

DONE.
