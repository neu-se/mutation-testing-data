  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the `arguments` object to a number, which would cause errors in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the `arguments` object to a string, which would cause errors in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the `arguments` object to a function that returns 0, which would cause errors in the code.

DONE.
