  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would change the value of `data`, potentially causing the `mapper` function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operator would change the value of `data`, potentially causing the `mapper` function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator would change the value of `data`, potentially causing the `mapper` function to return a different result.

DONE.
