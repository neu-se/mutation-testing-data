  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['theta']
```
This would result in different behavior because `a['theta']` is undefined, whereas `a['phi']` is defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b['phi']
```
This would result in different behavior because `b['phi']` is undefined, whereas `a['phi']` is defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['phi'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `a['phi'] + 1` is a different value than `a['phi']`.

DONE.
