  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof arg === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `arg` is a string and its length is 0, but this new code fragment only checks if `arg` is a number, which would result in a different outcome for non-numeric inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `arg` is a string and its length is 0, but this new code fragment checks if `arg` is a string and its length is greater than 0, which would result in a different outcome for strings with length greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `arg` is a string and its length is 0, but this new code fragment checks if `arg` is a string and its length is equal to
