  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the sum of `plus` and `minus` is greater than 0, while the new code fragment checks if the sum is less than 0. This would cause the `parser_exit()` function to be called in different cases, leading to different behavior.

DONE.
