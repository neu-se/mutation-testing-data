Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass all arguments to the `apply` method instead of skipping the first argument, potentially leading to incorrect function calls if the first argument is not intended to be used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first two arguments instead of the first one, which could cause the function to receive unexpected parameters or none at all, altering its intended execution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, arguments.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to pass an empty array to the `apply` method, as `arguments.length` would always be the total number of arguments, effectively resulting in no arguments being passed to the function being called.

DONE.
