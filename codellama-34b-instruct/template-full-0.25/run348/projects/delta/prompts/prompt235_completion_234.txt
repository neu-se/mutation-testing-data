  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(opLength - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would be called with a smaller value, which would cause the iterator to skip over the last operation in the other delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(opLength + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would be called with a larger value, which would cause the iterator to move beyond the end of the other delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(opLength * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would be called with a larger value, which would cause the iterator to move twice as far as it should in the other delta.

DONE.
