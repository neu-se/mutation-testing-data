  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream()
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextStream()` is a function call, which would cause the function to be executed immediately, rather than being passed as a reference to the `read` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextStream` is a function reference, which would be passed to the `read` function as a callback, rather than being executed immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextStream.bind(this)` creates a new function that, when called, will have the `this` value set to the current `this` value, rather than the `this` value of the `nextStream` function.

DONE.
