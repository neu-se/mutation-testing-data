  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op, index) => !predicate(op, index)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method would return the opposite of what the original code fragment would return, i.e. it would return the elements that do not satisfy the predicate instead of the elements that do satisfy it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op, index) => predicate(op, index) && index % 2 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method would only return the elements that satisfy the predicate and have an even index, instead of all the elements that satisfy the predicate.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op, index) => predicate(op, index) || index === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method would return all the elements that satisfy the predicate, as well as the first element of the array, regardless of whether it satisfies the predicate or not.
