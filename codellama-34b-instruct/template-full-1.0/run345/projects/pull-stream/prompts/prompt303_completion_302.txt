  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because the function expects a boolean value for the `end` parameter, but an empty string is a falsy value. This would cause the function to terminate early, even if the stream has not been fully consumed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || false
```
This would result in different behavior because the function expects a boolean value for the `end` parameter, but `ended || false` is always a boolean value, so it would not cause the function to terminate early if the stream has not been fully consumed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended
```
This would result in different behavior because the function expects a boolean value for the `end` parameter, but `!ended` is negating the value of the `ended` variable, so it would cause the function to terminate early if the stream has not been fully consumed.

DONE.
