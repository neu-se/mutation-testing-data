  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the truthiness of `end`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `end` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, which means that `end` must be both truthy and of the same type as `true` for the `if` statement to evaluate to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, which means that `end` must be either falsy or of a different type than `false` for the `if` statement to evaluate to `true`.

DONE.
