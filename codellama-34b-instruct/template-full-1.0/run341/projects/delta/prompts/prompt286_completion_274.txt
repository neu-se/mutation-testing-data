  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newline, start
```
This would result in different behavior because the newline character `\n` and the start symbol `^` have different meanings in the context of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start, newline
```
This would result in different behavior because the `start` symbol is a special character in JavaScript that indicates the beginning of a string, so it would cause the regular expression to match a different substring of the input string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newline, end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` symbol is a special character in JavaScript that indicates the end of a string, so it would cause the regular expression to match a different substring of the input string.

DONE.
