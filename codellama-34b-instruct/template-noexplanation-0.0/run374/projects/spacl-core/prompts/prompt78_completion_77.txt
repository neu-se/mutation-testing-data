  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule of this.rules.slice()
```
This change creates a shallow copy of the `rules` array, which can be useful for testing purposes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule of this.rules.reverse()
```
This change reverses the order of the `rules` array, which can help identify any bugs that may be related to the order of the rules.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule of this.rules.filter((rule) => rule.name === 'my-rule')
```
This change filters the `rules` array to only include rules with the name `'my-rule'`, which can help identify any bugs that may be related to specific rules.

DONE.
