  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { throw new Error("Testing mutation!"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error when the function is invoked, rather than defining a module.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return "Testing mutation!"; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a string when the function is invoked, rather than defining a module.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { console.log("Testing mutation!"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would log a message to the console when the function is invoked, rather than defining a module.

DONE.
