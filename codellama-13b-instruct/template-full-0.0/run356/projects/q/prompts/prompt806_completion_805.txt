  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `callback` is a reference to a function, while `callback()` is a function call that will execute the function and return its result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `callback` is a reference to a function, while `callback.call()` is a function call that will execute the function and return its result, but it will also pass the `this` context as the first argument to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `callback` is a reference to a function, while `callback.apply()` is a function call that will execute the function and return its result, but it will also pass the `this` context as the first argument to the function, and an array of arguments as the second argument to the function.
