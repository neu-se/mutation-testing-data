Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the result of the `test` function, meaning that the callback will be invoked when the test fails instead of when it passes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `data` is strictly equal to `null`, which would only trigger the callback if `data` is `null`, ignoring other falsy values like `undefined` or `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `data` is greater than zero, which would only invoke the callback for positive values, potentially missing valid cases where `data` is zero or negative.

DONE.
