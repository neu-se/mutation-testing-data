  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `1, a` returns a tuple with the values `1` and `a`, while the new code fragment `0` returns the value `0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `1, a` returns a tuple with the values `1` and `a`, while the new code fragment `-1` returns the value `-1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `1, a` returns a tuple with the values `1` and `a`, while the new code fragment `a` returns the value `a`.

DONE.
