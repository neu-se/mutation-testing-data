  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
asgn
```
This would result in different behavior because `asgn` is not a valid math operator and would cause a SyntaxError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atan
```
This would result in different behavior because `atan` is a valid math operator but its result would be different from `asin` when applied to the same input value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `acos` is a valid math operator but its result would be different from `asin` when applied to the same input value.

DONE.
