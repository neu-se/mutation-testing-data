  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1, w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first character of the word instead of the last two characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1, w.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the last character of the word instead of the last two characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 2, w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the last two characters of the word instead of the last three characters.

DONE.
