  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice method is now returning the third element of the array instead of the second.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').reverse().slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the reverse method is now being called before the slice method, which would cause the first element of the array to be returned instead of the second.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').map(x => x.replace('/', '')).slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the map method is now being called to remove any forward slashes from the array elements, and then the slice method is returning the first element of the modified array instead of the second.

DONE.
