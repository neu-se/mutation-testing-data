  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
';'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be parsing the glob pattern incorrectly, potentially resulting in a different set of files being included in the archive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'|'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be using a different delimiter to separate the glob pattern parts, potentially resulting in a different set of files being included in the archive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be using a different delimiter to separate the glob pattern parts, potentially resulting in a different set of files being included in the archive.

DONE.
