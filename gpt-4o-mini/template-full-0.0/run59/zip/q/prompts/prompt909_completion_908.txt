Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the base arguments to an empty array, which would cause the wrapped function to receive no arguments instead of the intended ones.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it alters the base arguments to include only the first argument, potentially omitting necessary arguments that the callback function expects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a negative index, which could lead to unexpected results or errors when trying to access elements in the arguments array.

DONE.
