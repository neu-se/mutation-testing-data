  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the argument is a number, while this replacement checks if it is not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the argument is a number, while this replacement checks if it is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the argument is a number, while this replacement checks if it is null.

DONE.
