  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 1)` would return an array of the arguments starting from the second argument, whereas `PLACEHOLDER` would return an array of all arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 0)` would return an array of all arguments, whereas `PLACEHOLDER` would return an array of the arguments starting from the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments.slice(1)` would return an array of the arguments starting from the second argument, whereas `PLACEHOLDER` would return an array of all arguments.

DONE.
