  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be passing only one argument to the `nodeArgs` array, instead of two.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be passing three arguments to the `nodeArgs` array, instead of two.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be passing no arguments to the `nodeArgs` array, instead of two.

DONE.
