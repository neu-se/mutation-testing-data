  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would not reset the `unhandledRejections` array, which would cause the promise tracking features to become incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.length = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would not reset the `unhandledReasons` array, which would cause the promise tracking features to become incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.length = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would not reset the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, which would cause the promise tracking features to become incorrect.

DONE.
