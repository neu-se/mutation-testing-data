  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const embedType = 'image';
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking for the presence of the `embedType` property in the `otherOp` object, but the new code fragment is always setting `embedType` to `'image'`, which may not be the correct value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const embedType = otherOp.embedType;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking for the presence of the `embedType` property in the `otherOp` object, but the new code fragment is always setting `embedType` to the value of `otherOp.embedType`, which may not be the correct value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const embedType = 'embed';
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking for the presence of the `embedType` property in the `otherOp` object, but the new code fragment is always setting `
