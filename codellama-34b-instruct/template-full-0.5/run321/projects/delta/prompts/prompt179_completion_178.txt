  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek
```
This would result in different behavior because peek returns the next operation without advancing the iterator, whereas next advances the iterator and returns the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek
```
This would result in different behavior because peek returns the next operation without advancing the iterator, whereas next advances the iterator and returns the next operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because peekLength returns the length of the next operation, whereas next returns the next operation itself.

DONE.
