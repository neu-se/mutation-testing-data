  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.split("/").join(" ")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method is being used on the `href` string, which would return an array of substrings split by the `/` character. The `join` method is then being called on this array, which would join the substrings back together with a space character as the separator. This would result in a string that is different from the original `href` string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method is being used to extract a portion of the `href` string, starting from the first character and ending at the second-to-last character. This would result in a string that is one character shorter than the original `href` string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.replace(/^https?:\/\//, "//")
```
This would result in different behavior because
