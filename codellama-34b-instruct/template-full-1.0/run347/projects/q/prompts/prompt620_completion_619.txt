  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q("object").dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because it would try to access the `dispatch` property of the string "object" instead of the `object` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object)[dispatch]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would try to access the `dispatch` property of the `object` variable using bracket notation instead of dot notation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.dispatch("object", "dispatch")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would try to invoke the `dispatch` method of the `Q` object with the `object` variable and the string "dispatch" as arguments, instead of invoking the `dispatch` method of the `object` variable.

DONE.
