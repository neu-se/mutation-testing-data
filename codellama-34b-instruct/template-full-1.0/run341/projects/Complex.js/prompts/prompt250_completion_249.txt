  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting function would use the sine function instead of the cosine function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting function would use the tangent function instead of the cosine function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting function would use the square root function instead of the cosine function.

DONE.
