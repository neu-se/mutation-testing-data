Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it shifts the starting index by 1, potentially causing the `indexOf` method to return an incorrect position, leading to unexpected results in line processing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newline.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the length of the newline string instead of the starting position, which would not correctly calculate the index of the substring within the current line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it decreases the starting index by 1, which could lead to an out-of-bounds access or incorrect index calculations when searching for the substring in the line.

DONE.
