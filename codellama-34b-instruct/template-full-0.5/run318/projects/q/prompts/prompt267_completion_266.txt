  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(new Error(reason));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new error object and pass it to `become`, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the new error object instead of the original reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(Q.reject(reason));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new rejected promise with the original reason and pass it to `become`, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the new rejected promise instead of the original reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(Q.resolve(reason));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new resolved promise with the original reason and pass it to `become`, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the new resolved promise instead of the original reason.

DONE.
