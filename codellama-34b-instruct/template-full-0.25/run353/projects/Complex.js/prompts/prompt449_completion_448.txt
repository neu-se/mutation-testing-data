  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would add an extra 1 to the result, which would cause the `Math.round` function to round up to the next integer instead of rounding down.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would subtract 1 from the result, which would cause the `Math.round` function to round down to the previous integer instead of rounding up.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would double the result, which would cause the `Math.round` function to round to the nearest even integer instead of the nearest integer.

DONE.
