  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 179
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by 179 instead of 180 would cause a subtle error in the calculation, leading to an incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 181
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by 181 instead of 180 would cause a subtle error in the calculation, leading to an incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude * (Math.PI / 180) * 1.00001
```
This would result in different behavior because the small adjustment of 0.00001 would cause a significant error in the calculation, leading to completely incorrect results.

DONE.
