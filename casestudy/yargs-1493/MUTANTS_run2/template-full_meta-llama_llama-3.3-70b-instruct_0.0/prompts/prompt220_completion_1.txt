Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!sw
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator inverts the boolean value of `sw`, potentially changing the prefix added to the switch from '-' or '--' to the opposite, depending on the original value of `sw`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
sw + 'x'
```
This would result in different behavior because appending 'x' to `sw` changes the string used to determine the prefix, potentially causing the code to incorrectly add a prefix to the switch.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
options.alias[sw]
```
This would result in different behavior because using `options.alias[sw]` instead of `sw` changes the value used to determine the prefix, potentially causing the code to incorrectly add a prefix to the switch or throw an error if `sw` is not a valid key in `options.alias`.

DONE.
