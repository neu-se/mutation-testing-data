  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment expects `data` to be an object, but `null` is not an object and will cause the code to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment expects `data` to be defined, but `undefined` is a keyword that indicates a variable is not defined and will cause the code to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment expects `data` to be a string, but `data + 1` is an expression that adds 1 to the value of `data`, which will result in a different value and potentially cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
