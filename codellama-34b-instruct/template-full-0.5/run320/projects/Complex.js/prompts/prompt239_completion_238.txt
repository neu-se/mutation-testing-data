  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` is a function that calculates the sine of a number, whereas `Math.sqrt` is a function that calculates the square root of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a constant that represents the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, whereas `Math.sqrt` is a function that calculates the square root of a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random` is a function that generates a random number between 0 and 1, whereas `Math.sqrt` is a function that calculates the square root of a number.

DONE.
