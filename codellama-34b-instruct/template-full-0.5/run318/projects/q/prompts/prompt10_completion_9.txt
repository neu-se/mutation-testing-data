  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, while this replacement is a mathematical expression that would return 2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Hello, world!"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, while this replacement is a string literal that would be returned as the result of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, while this replacement is a null value that would be returned as the result of the function.

DONE.
