  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `data - 1` would always return a new value, whereas `data` could be a reference to a mutable object, and the test suite may not be checking if the `data` object is being mutated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `data.length` would always return the length of the `data` array, whereas `data` could be a reference to a mutable object and the test suite may not be checking if the `data` object is being mutated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.filter(x => x > 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `data.filter(x => x > 0)` would always return a new array where each element is greater than 0, whereas `data` could be a reference to a mutable object and the test suite may not be checking if the `
