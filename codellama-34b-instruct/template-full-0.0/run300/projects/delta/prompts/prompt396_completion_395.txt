  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.retain` is always truthy, whereas `otherOp.delete` is only truthy if the operation is a delete operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `!otherOp.delete` is always falsy, whereas `otherOp.delete` is only falsy if the operation is not a delete operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.attributes` is always an object, whereas `otherOp.delete` is only an object if the operation has attributes.

DONE.
