  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Buffer.isUtf8
```
This would result in different behavior because `Buffer.isUtf8` checks if the input is a UTF-8 encoded string, whereas `Buffer.isBuffer` checks if the input is a buffer object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Buffer.isBuffer
```
This would result in different behavior because `!Buffer.isBuffer` checks if the input is not a buffer object, whereas `Buffer.isBuffer` checks if the input is a buffer object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Buffer.isEncoding
```
This would result in different behavior because `Buffer.isEncoding` checks if the input is a valid encoding, whereas `Buffer.isBuffer` checks if the input is a buffer object.

DONE.
