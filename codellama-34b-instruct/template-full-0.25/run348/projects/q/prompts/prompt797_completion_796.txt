  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `void 0` to indicate that the second and third arguments to `then` are not provided, while the new code fragment uses an empty function to achieve the same effect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `void 0` to indicate that the second and third arguments to `then` are not provided, while the new code fragment uses `null` to achieve the same effect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `void 0` to indicate that the second and third arguments to `then` are not provided, while the new code fragment uses `undefined` to achieve the same effect.

DONE.
