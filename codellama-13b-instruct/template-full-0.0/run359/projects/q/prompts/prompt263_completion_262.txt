  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfill(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a call to the `fulfill` method of the `deferred` object, which is not defined in the code provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a call to the `fulfill` method of the `deferred` object, which is not defined in the code provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a call to the `fulfill` method of the `deferred` object, which is not defined in the code provided.

DONE.
