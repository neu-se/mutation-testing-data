  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var args = array_slice(arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `array_slice(arguments, 1)`, which skips the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var args = array_slice(arguments, 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `array_slice(arguments, 1)`, which skips the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var args = array_slice(arguments, 3);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `array_slice(arguments, 1)`, which skips the first argument.

DONE.
