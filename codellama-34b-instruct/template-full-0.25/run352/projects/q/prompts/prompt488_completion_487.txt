  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resetUnhandledRejections` function would be called twice, which would reset the `unhandledRejections` array to an empty state, potentially hiding any unhandled rejections that occurred before the second call.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would directly set the `length` property of the `unhandledRejections` array to 0, without calling the `resetUnhandledRejections` function, which could potentially cause issues if the function has side effects or if the array is used elsewhere in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections = false;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `trackUnhandledRejections` variable to `false`, which would prevent any further tracking of unhandled rejections
