  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.reviver.call(null, key, value)
```
This code fragment uses the `call` method to invoke the `reviver` function with a specific `this` value (in this case, `null`) and two arguments (`key` and `value`). This can be used to test the behavior of the `reviver` function when it is called with different arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.reviver.bind(null, key, value)
```
This code fragment uses the `bind` method to create a new function that is bound to a specific `this` value (in this case, `null`) and two arguments (`key` and `value`). This can be used to test the behavior of the `reviver` function when it is called with different arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.reviver.apply(null, [key, value])
```
This code fragment uses the `
