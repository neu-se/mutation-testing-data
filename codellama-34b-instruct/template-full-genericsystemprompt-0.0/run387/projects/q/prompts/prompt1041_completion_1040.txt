  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve({
    head: value,
    tail: next.promise
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next.promise` would be resolved with the `head` value, instead of the `tail` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve({
    head: value,
    tail: Q.reject(new Error("Can't get value from closed queue"))
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tail` value would be a rejected promise, instead of a resolved promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve({
    head: value,
    tail: Q.resolve(next.promise)
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tail` value would be a resolved promise, instead of a rejected promise.

DONE.
