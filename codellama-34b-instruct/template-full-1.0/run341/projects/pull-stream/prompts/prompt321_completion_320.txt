  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned `null, data`, while the new code fragment returns `undefined`. This could cause issues in the code that consumes the function's return value, as it may not handle `undefined` values correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned `null, data`, while the new code fragment returns `null`. This could cause issues in the code that consumes the function's return value, as it may not handle `null` values correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned `null, data`, while the new code fragment returns `NaN` (not a number). This could cause issues in the code that consumes the function's return value, as it may not handle `NaN` values correctly.

DONE.
