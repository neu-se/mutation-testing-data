  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `return` statement would cause the function to exit early, without executing the rest of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error(<PLACEHOLDER>(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throw` statement would cause an error to be thrown, which would be caught by the `catch` block if one is present, or would cause the program to crash if there is no `catch` block.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(<PLACEHOLDER>(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `console.log` statement would log the value of the expression to the console, but would not affect the behavior of the rest of the code.

DONE.
