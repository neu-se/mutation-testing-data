  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 - b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `1 + b * b`, which is a sum of two positive numbers, while the replaced code fragment is `1 - b * b`, which is a difference of two positive numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `1 + b * b`, which is a sum of two positive numbers, while the replaced code fragment is `b * b - 1`, which is a difference of two positive numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `1 + b * b`, which is a sum of two positive numbers, while the replaced code fragment is `b * b + 1`, which is a sum of two positive numbers and a negative number.

DONE.
