  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be true when `index` is 0, which would cause the `while` loop to execute an extra iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be false when `index` is 0, which would cause the `while` loop to not execute at all.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be true when `index` is 0, which would cause the `while` loop to execute an extra iteration.

DONE.
