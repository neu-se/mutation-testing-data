Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0], strings[1], 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `cursor` parameter with a constant value of `0`, which may lead to incorrect indexing or processing of the deltas, potentially causing unexpected results in the diff operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0], strings[1], null
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the `cursor` parameter to `null`, which could lead to null reference errors or cause the diff function to behave incorrectly if it expects a number or a specific object type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[1], strings[0], cursor
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the order of the strings being compared, which could lead to a completely different diff result, as the comparison logic would now be evaluating the second string against the first instead of the intended order.

DONE.
