  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
\f
```
This would result in different behavior because `f` is not a valid regular expression flag, and using it would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
\end{code}
```
This would result in different behavior because `end` is not a valid regular expression delimiter, and using it would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
\gim
```
This would result in different behavior because `gim` are not valid regular expression flags, and using them would cause an error.

DONE.
