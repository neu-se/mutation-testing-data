  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(this.index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the `ops` array starting from the next index instead of the current index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(this.index - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the `ops` array starting from the previous index instead of the current index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(this.index, this.index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the `ops` array starting from the current index and ending at the next index instead of returning the entire array.

DONE.
