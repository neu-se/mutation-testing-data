  Sure, here are three possible options for the PLACEHOLDER:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'pers assigned', 'peoples'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the pattern of the rule, which was originally `'person', 'people'`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'persons', 'peoples'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the words used in the rule, which were originally `'person', 'people'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'person', 'peoples'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the plural form of the word, which was originally `'people'`.

DONE.
