  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' && otherIter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `transform` method to prioritize inserting operations over retaining operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() !== 'insert' && otherIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `transform` method to prioritize retaining operations over inserting operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' && otherIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `transform` method to prioritize inserting operations over retaining operations, but only when both operations are inserts.

DONE.
