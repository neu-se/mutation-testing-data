  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href').substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `$` function to get the `href` attribute of the current element, but this replacement code uses the `substring` method to remove the first character of the `href` attribute, which could change the value of the link.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href').replace(/^https?:\/\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `$` function to get the `href` attribute of the current element, but this replacement code uses the `replace` method to remove the protocol (http or https) from the `href` attribute, which could change the value of the link.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href').split('://').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `$` function to get the `href`
