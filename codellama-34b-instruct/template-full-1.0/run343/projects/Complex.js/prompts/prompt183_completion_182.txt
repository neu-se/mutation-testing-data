  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] === 0
```
This would result in a division by zero error, as `z['re']` is always non-zero, and therefore `c` and `d` would be assigned the value of zero, causing the function to return the wrong results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] === 1
```
This would cause the function to always return the complex number `a + bi`, as `z['im']` is always non-zero, and therefore `x` and `t` are always assigned the value of zero, causing the function to use the second condition and return `new Complex(a, b)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] + z['im'] === 0
```
This would cause the function to always return the complex number `a + bi`, as `z['re'] + z['im']` is always zero, and therefore `x` and `t` are always
