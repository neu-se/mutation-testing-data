  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set
```
This would result in different behavior because `set` is a method that adds or updates an element with a specified key and a value to a Map, whereas `get` is a method that returns a specified element from a Map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a method that removes an element with a specified key from a Map, whereas `get` is a method that returns a specified element from a Map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.keys
```
This would result in different behavior because `keys` is a method that returns an iterable of the keys in a Map, whereas `get` is a method that returns a specified element from a Map.

DONE.
