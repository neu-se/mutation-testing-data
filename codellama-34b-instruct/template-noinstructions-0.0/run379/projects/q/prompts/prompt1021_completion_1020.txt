  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, deferred.makeNodeResolver()]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function is not present in the original code fragment, which means that the promise will not be resolved or rejected in the same way as it would be with the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, function() {}]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `function() {}` function is not present in the original code fragment, which means that the promise will not be resolved or rejected in the same way as it would be with the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value is not present in the original code fragment, which means that the promise will not be resolved or rejected in the same way as it would be with the original code.

DONE.
