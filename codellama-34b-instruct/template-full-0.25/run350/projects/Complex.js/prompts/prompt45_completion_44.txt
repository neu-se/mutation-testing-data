  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a == undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `a` is undefined or null, while this new code only checks if `a` is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `a` is undefined or null, while this new code only checks if `a` is null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `a` is undefined or null, while this new code checks if `a` is not equal to itself, which is always false.

DONE.
