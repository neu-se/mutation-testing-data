  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href + "a"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the letter "a" to the end of the href attribute, which would likely cause the link to point to a different URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.replace("http://", "https://")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the "http://" protocol with "https://", which would likely cause the link to point to a different URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.split("/")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the href attribute on the "/" character and return the first part of the URL, which would likely cause the link to point to a different URL.

DONE.
