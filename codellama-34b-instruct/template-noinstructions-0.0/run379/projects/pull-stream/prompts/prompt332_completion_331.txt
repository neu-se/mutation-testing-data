  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end` would pass a non-null value to the `once` function, while the new code fragment `null` would pass a null value. This could cause the `once` function to behave differently, potentially leading to a failure in the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end` would pass a defined value to the `once` function, while the new code fragment `undefined` would pass an undefined value. This could cause the `once` function to behave differently, potentially leading to a failure in the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end` would pass a non-zero value to the `once` function, while the new code fragment `0` would pass a zero value. This could cause the `once` function to behave differently
