  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'i' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `w.substr(0, w.length - 2)` to remove the last two characters of the word, while this new code fragment uses `w.substr(0, w.length - 1)` to remove only the last character. This would cause the plural form of words ending in "nucleus", "syllabus", "focus", "fungus", or "cactus" to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'us' }
```
This would result in different behavior because
