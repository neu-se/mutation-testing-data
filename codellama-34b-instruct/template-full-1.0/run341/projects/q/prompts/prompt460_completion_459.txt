  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_indexOf(reportedUnhandledRejections, promise) != -2
```
This would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, meaning that the `process.emit()` function would be called every time, even if the promise was not unhandled. This would result in unncessesary processing and potential errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections[at] != promise
```
This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if the promise is not found in the `unhandledRejections` array, which would mean that it was handled or already reported. This would result in unnecessary processing and potential errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.isFulfilled()
```
This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if the promise is fulfilled, which would mean that it was already handled. This would result in unnecessary processing and potential errors.
