  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(fulfill(reason));
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill` is not a function, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(Q(reject(reason)));
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is not a function, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(Q(reason));
```
This would result in different behavior because `reason` is not a promise, and would cause the `become` function to behave differently.

DONE.
