  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (cb) return end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls `end` if `cb` is truthy, whereas this new code fragment would always call `end` regardless of the value of `cb`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = function(cb) {
  cb();
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment assigns to `end` a function that takes a callback function as an argument, whereas this new code fragment assigns to `end` a function that takes no arguments and simply calls `cb()` without passing any arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment assigns to `end` a function that returns a random number, whereas this new code fragment assigns to `end` a number returned by `Math.random()`.

DONE.
