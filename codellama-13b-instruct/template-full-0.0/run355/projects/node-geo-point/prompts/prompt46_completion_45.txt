  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `deg2rad` is a function that converts degrees to radians, while `Math.PI` is a constant that represents the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. Replacing `deg2rad` with `Math.PI` would cause the code to calculate the bearing in radians instead of degrees, which could result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `deg2rad` is a function that converts degrees to radians, while `Math.sin` is a function that calculates the sine of an angle in radians. Replacing `deg2rad` with `Math.sin` would cause the code to calculate the sine of the latitude and longitude instead of converting them to radians, which could result in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.
