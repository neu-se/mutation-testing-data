  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method takes two arguments, the first is the index at which to start removing elements, and the second is the number of elements to remove. In the original code, the first argument is `at`, which is the index of the promise in the `unhandledRejections` array, and the second argument is `1`, which means to remove one element from the array. If we replace `1` with `2`, it would remove two elements from the array, which would cause the `untrackRejection` method to behave incorrectly.
