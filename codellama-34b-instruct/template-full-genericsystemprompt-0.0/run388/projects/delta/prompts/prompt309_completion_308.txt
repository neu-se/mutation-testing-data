  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.delete(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `line`, which would push the `line` object onto the `retain` array, while the modified code fragment would delete the first character of the `line` object and push the modified `line` object onto the `retain` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.retain(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `line`, which would push the `line` object onto the `retain` array, while the modified code fragment would retain the first character of the `line` object and push the modified `line` object onto the `retain` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.insert(0, ' ')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `line`, which would push the `line` object onto the `retain` array, while the modified code
