  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl || currentUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `currentUrl`, even if `currentUrl` is null or undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!currentUrl && currentUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `null`, even if `currentUrl` is not null or undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!currentUrl || currentUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `currentUrl.url`, even if `currentUrl` is not null or undefined.

DONE.
