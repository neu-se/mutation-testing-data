  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is not null, and it contains the arguments passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is not an empty array, and it contains the arguments passed to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is not a number, and it contains the arguments passed to the function.

DONE.
