  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method returns a rejected promise, whereas the `get` method returns a resolved promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.then
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method returns a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the callback function, whereas the `get` method returns a resolved promise with the value of the `head` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.catch
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch` method returns a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the callback function, whereas the `get` method returns a resolved promise with the value of the `head` property.

DONE.
