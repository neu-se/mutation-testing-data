  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would return a rejected promise instead of a fulfilled one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would return a promise that is still pending instead of a fulfilled one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { throw new Error(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would return a rejected promise instead of a fulfilled one.

DONE.
