  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && !ended
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `read` function to be called with `end` set to `true` and `ended` set to `false`, which would cause the stream to be closed prematurely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end && ended
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `read` function to be called with `end` set to `false` and `ended` set to `true`, which would cause the stream to continue reading even after the end of the stream has been reached.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || !end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `read` function to be called with `ended` set to `true` or `end` set to `false`, which would cause the stream to be closed prematurely or continue reading even after the end of the stream has been reached.

DONE.
