  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the result to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the result to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the result to be incorrect.

DONE.
