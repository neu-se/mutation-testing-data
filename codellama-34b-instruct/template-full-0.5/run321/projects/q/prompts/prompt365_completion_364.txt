  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!done
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `done` variable, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, regardless of the value of `done`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done == false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `==` operator checks for equality, so the `if` statement would only be executed if `done` is strictly equal to `false`, which is not necessarily the case if `done` is a truthy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for inequality, so the `if` statement would only be executed if `done` is not strictly equal to `true`, which is not necessarily the case if `done` is a falsy value.

DONE.
