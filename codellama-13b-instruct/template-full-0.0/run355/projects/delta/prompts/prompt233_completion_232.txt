  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `eachLine` method to iterate over the entire delta, rather than just the lines.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `eachLine` method to only iterate over the first op in the delta, rather than all of them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.ops.length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `eachLine` method to only iterate over the last op in the delta, rather than all of them.

DONE.
