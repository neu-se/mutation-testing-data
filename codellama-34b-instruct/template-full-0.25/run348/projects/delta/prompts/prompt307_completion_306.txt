  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const line = new Delta();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new `Delta` object instead of using the existing `line` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const line = new Delta(this.ops.slice());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new `Delta` object with a copy of the existing `ops` array, instead of using the existing `line` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const line = new Delta(this.ops.slice(0, 1));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new `Delta` object with a copy of the first element of the existing `ops` array, instead of using the existing `line` variable.

DONE.
