 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve` may behave differently than `Q.resolve` in certain edge cases, especially if the library being used has different implementation or version.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of resolving the promise, it would immediately reject it, which might not be the intended behavior in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { throw new Error('Buggy!') }
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a new error, which would cause the promise to be rejected, rather than being resolved as in the original code.

DONE.
