 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'http://localhost'
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets a specific base URL instead of using the original `baseUrlStr` variable, which could lead to unexpected results in certain scenarios.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the base URL entirely, which could cause issues when parsing relative URLs in the `extract` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'https://example.com'
