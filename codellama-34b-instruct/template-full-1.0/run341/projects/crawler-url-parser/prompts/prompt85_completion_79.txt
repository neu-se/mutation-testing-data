  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).siblings().text().trim();
```
This would result in different behavior because `.siblings()` would select all the sibling elements of the current element, rather than just the immediate child elements, and `.text()` would return the text content of all the sibling elements, not just the immediate child elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).children().text().trim();
```
This would result in different behavior because `.children()` would only select the immediate child elements of the current element, whereas `.siblings()` would select all the sibling elements, including the immediate child elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).find('*').text().trim();
```
This would result in different behavior because `.find('*')` would select all the descendant elements of the current element, whereas `.siblings()` and `.children()` would only select the immediate child or sibling elements.

DONE.
