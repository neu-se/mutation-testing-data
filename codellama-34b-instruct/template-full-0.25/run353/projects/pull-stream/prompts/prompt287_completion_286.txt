  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the `data` variable, while `null` is a literal value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the `data` variable, while `undefined` is a literal value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the `data` variable, while `mapper(data)` is a function call that may return a different value than `data`.

DONE.
