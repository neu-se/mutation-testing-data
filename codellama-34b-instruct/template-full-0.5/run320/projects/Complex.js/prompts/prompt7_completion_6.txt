  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log(a) + Math.log(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log(a * b)` would be computed as `Math.log(a) + Math.log(b)`, which is incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log(a * b)` would be computed as `Math.log(a + b)`, which is incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log(a * b)` would be computed as `Math.log(a * b)`, which is incorrect.

DONE.
