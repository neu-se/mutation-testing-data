  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.query(path, verb, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `policy.query`, which is a method that takes three arguments, while the new code fragment takes only one argument. This would cause the method to be called with the wrong number of arguments, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.query(path, verb, ctx, {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment did not include the fourth argument, which is an object that contains additional context for the query. Including this argument in the new code fragment would cause the method to be called with the wrong number of arguments, leading to unexpected behavior.
