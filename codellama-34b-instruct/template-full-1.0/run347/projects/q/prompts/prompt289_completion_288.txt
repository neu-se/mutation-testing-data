  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (!resolvedPromise) {
    become(Q(value));
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always call `become` with a resolved promise, regardless of whether the promise is already resolved or not. In the original code, `resolvedPromise` is only set to true once, so `become` will only be called once per promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (resolvedPromise) {
    become(reject(value));
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `become` with a rejected promise instead of a resolved one. In the original code, `become` is called with a resolved promise if the promise is already resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (resolvedPromise) {
    become(fulfill(value));
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `fulfill` instead of `re
