  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` property of the `newOp` object is not a string, but rather an object. This would cause the `insert` method to throw an error when it tries to concatenate the `insert` property with the `arg` parameter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property of the `newOp` object is not a number, but rather an object. This would cause the `retain` method to throw an error when it tries to add the `retain` property to the `length` parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` property of the `newOp` object is not a number, but rather an object. This would cause the `delete` method to throw an error when it tries to subtract the `delete
