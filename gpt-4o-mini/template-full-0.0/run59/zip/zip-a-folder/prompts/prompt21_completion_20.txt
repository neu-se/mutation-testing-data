Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'output.zip'
```
This would result in different behavior because it hardcodes the output file name to 'output.zip', ignoring the specified `targetFilePath`, which could lead to overwriting files unintentionally.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src + '.tar'
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `src` variable to create the output file name instead of the `targetFilePath`, which could lead to incorrect file naming and potential overwriting of existing files.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the output stream to `undefined`, which would cause an error when trying to pipe the `zipArchive` to an undefined output, leading to a runtime exception.

DONE.
