  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^\ufeff/g, '')
```
This code fragment uses the `replace` method to remove the UTF-8 BOM (Byte Order Mark) from the beginning of the file content. The regular expression `/^\ufeff/g` matches the BOM character at the beginning of the string, and the `g` flag ensures that all occurrences are replaced.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.slice(1)
```
This code fragment uses the `slice` method to remove the first character of the file content, which is the BOM character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^\ufeff/g, '').trim()
```
This code fragment first removes the BOM character using the `replace` method, and then trims any whitespace characters from the beginning and end of the string using the `trim` method.

DONE.
