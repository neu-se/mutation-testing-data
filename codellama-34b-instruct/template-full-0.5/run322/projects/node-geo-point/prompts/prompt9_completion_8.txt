  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'typee'
```
This would result in different behavior because the property name is misspelled, and the code would no longer check for the correct property name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'typ'
```
This would result in different behavior because the property name is incomplete, and the code would no longer check for the correct property name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'type' + 'e'
```
This would result in different behavior because the property name is concatenated with the string 'e', and the code would no longer check for the correct property name.

DONE.
