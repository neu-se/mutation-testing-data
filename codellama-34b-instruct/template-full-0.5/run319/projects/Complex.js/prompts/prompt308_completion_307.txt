  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the `d` variable, which is used in the calculation of the `t1` and `t2` variables.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the `d` variable, which is used in the calculation of the `t1` and `t2` variables.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the `d` variable, which is used in the calculation of the `t1` and `t2` variables.

DONE.
