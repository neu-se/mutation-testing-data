  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is not the same as the `next` function, and it would cause the loop to exit early.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function and would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty function would not have the same effect as the `next` function, and it would cause the loop to exit early.

DONE.
