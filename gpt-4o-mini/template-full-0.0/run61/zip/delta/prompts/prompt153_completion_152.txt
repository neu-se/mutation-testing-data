Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.hasNext() && otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to require both iterators to have next elements, potentially skipping operations that should be processed if only one iterator has elements left.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!thisIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the condition, causing the loop to execute only when `thisIter` does not have any next elements, which could lead to missing operations that should be processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check if the next operation type is 'insert', which would alter the flow of processing and potentially skip over 'delete' operations that should be handled.

DONE.
