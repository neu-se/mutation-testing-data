  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `prop` object is not a function, and therefore does not have a `test` method. This would cause the code to throw an error when it tries to call `test` on `prop`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.test()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `prop` object is not a function, and therefore does not have a `test` method. This would cause the code to throw an error when it tries to call `test` on `prop`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.test.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `prop` object is not a function, and therefore does not have a `test` method. This would cause the code to throw an error when it tries to access the `test` property of `prop`.

DONE.
