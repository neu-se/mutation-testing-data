 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unhandledReasons.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unhandledReasons` array slice would receive an integer as the second argument instead of `1`, causing it to slice the array from the index of the removed rejection up to the specified number of elements, instead of slicing just one element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `unhandledReasons.splice` would receive `null` as the second argument, causing it to remove all elements from the index to the end of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unhandledReasons.length - 1
