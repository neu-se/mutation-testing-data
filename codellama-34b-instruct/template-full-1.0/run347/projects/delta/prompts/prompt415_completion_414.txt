  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasNext` returns a boolean indicating whether there are more operations in the iterator, while `peekType` returns the type of the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `next` returns the next operation in the iterator, while `peekType` only returns the type of the operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an infinite loop, as `peekType` would always return the same value, and the loop would never terminate.

DONE.
