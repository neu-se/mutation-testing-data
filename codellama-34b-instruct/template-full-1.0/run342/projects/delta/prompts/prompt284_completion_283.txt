  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\n\n'
```
This would result in different behavior because a newline character is being inserted twice, whereas the original code fragment only inserted a single newline character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\r\n'
```
This would result in different behavior because a carriage return and newline character are being inserted, whereas the original code fragment only inserted a single newline character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'<br>\n'
```
This would result in different behavior because a line break and newline character are being inserted, whereas the original code fragment only inserted a single newline character.

DONE.
