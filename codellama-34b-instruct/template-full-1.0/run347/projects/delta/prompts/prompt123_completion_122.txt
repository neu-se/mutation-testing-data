  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < end || iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the loop to continue even if the `index` reaches `end`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the loop to continue even if the `index` equals `end`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < end - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the loop to continue even if the `index` is equal to or greater than `end - 1`, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
