Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ices' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly removes only the last character of the word instead of the last two characters, leading to incorrect pluralization for words like "index".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the ending with 's' instead of 'ices', which is incorrect for words like "index" that should pluralize to "indices".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'x' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the ending with 'x' instead of 'ices', which would lead to incorrect pluralization for words like "index", resulting in "indexx" instead of "indices".

DONE.
