  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `name` variable is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if it is equal to `null`. In some cases, a function may not work properly if `name` is `null`, even if it is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name !== 'abc'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `name` is not equal to `'abc'`, while this new code fragment checks it against a different value. If the value of `name` is `'abc'`, the original code fragment would return `null`, but this new code fragment would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Boolean(name)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `name` is falsy, while this new code fragment explicitly converts `name` to a boolean value and then inverts it
