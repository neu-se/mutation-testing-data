  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedBaseUrlStr.replace(/^https?:\/\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would remove the protocol from the URL, which could cause the `parse` function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedBaseUrlStr.replace(/\/+$/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would remove any trailing slashes from the URL, which could cause the `parse` function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedBaseUrlStr.replace(/^https?:\/\//, '').replace(/\/+$/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would remove the protocol and any trailing slashes from the URL, which could cause the `parse` function to return a different result.

DONE.
