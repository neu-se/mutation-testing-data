  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fallback === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, and `void 0` is a special value that represents the absence of a value. In this case, the `fallback` function is expected to be a function, and replacing `void 0` with `null` would cause the code to throw an error if `fallback` is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fallback === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value, and `void 0` is a special value that represents the absence of a value. In this case, the `fallback` function is expected to be a function, and replacing `void 0` with `undefined` would cause the code to throw an error if `fallback` is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fallback === NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a
