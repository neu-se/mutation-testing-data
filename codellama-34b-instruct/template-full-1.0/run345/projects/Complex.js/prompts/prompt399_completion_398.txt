  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['atan']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `acos` to find the arc cosine, but the replacement code uses `atan` to find the arc tangent.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['acosh']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `acos` to find the arc cosine, but the replacement code uses `acosh` to find the hyperbolic arc cosine.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['asin']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `acos` to find the arc cosine, but the replacement code uses `asin` to find the arc sine.

DONE.
