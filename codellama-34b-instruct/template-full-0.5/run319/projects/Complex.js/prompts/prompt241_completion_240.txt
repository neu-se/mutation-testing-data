  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the sine of the argument instead of the exponential function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the cosine of the argument instead of the exponential function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the tangent of the argument instead of the exponential function.

DONE.
