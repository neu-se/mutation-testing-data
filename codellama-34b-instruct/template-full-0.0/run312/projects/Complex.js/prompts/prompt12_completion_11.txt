  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-y
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `x` to calculate the cosine, while the replaced code fragment uses the value of `y`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `x` to calculate the cosine, while the replaced code fragment uses the value of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `x` to calculate the cosine, while the replaced code fragment uses the value of `b`.

DONE.
