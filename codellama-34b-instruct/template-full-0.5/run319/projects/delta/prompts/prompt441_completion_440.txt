  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.insert.substring
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring` is a different method than `substr`, and it has different parameters and behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.insert.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` is a different method than `substr`, and it has different parameters and behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.insert.replace
```
This would result in different behavior because `replace` is a different method than `substr`, and it has different parameters and behavior.

DONE.
