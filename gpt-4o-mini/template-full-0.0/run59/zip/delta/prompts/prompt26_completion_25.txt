Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of the object's own enumerable property values, which may not accurately reflect the keys of the attributes being compared, potentially leading to incorrect results in the `diff` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(attributes).length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because changing the condition to check for equality to zero would return `true` when there are no attributes, which is the opposite of the original logic that checks if there are any attributes present.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(a).length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if the object `a` has any keys, ignoring the actual `attributes` object, which could lead to incorrect conclusions about whether there are differences between `a` and `b`.

DONE.
