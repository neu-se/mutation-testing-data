  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This change will cause the `cb` function to be called with `undefined` as the first argument, which is different from the original code where `null` was passed. This change may cause the test suite to fail if it is not expecting `undefined` as the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This change will cause the `cb` function to be called with `true` as the first argument, which is different from the original code where `null` was passed. This change may cause the test suite to fail if it is not expecting `true` as the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This change will cause the `cb` function to be called with `false` as the first argument, which is different from the original code where `null` was passed. This change may cause the test suite to fail if it is not expecting `false` as the first argument.

DONE.
