  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.never(makeGenerator);
```
This would result in different behavior because Q.never returns a promise that never resolves, so the generator function will never be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw Q.error("Error");
```
This would result in different behavior because it throws an error immediately, preventing the generator function from being executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a promise that is rejected with a null value, which can cause errors in the surrounding code.

DONE.
