  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[-1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref[-1]` would return the last element of the `ref` array instead of the first element, which is what the original code fragment was intended to do.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref[1]` would return the second element of the `ref` array instead of the first element, which is what the original code fragment was intended to do.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[length]
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref[length]` would return `undefined` instead of the first element of the `ref` array, which is what the original code fragment was intended to do.

DONE.
