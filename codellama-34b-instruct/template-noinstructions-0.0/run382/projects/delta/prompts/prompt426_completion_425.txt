  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.delete === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.delete` is a number, but this replacement checks if it's a string. If `op.delete` is a string, the original code would return `op.delete`, but this replacement would return `1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.delete !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.delete` is a number, but this replacement checks if it's not a number. If `op.delete` is not a number, the original code would return `op.delete`, but this replacement would return `1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.delete` is a number, but this replacement checks if it's undefined. If `op.delete` is undefined
