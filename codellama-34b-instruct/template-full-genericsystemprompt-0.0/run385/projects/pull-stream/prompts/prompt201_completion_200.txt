  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb
```
This would result in different behavior because `abortCb` is a function that takes an argument, but `cb` is a function that takes no arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(aborted)
```
This would result in different behavior because `abortCb(aborted)` is a function call that passes the `aborted` argument to the `abortCb` function, but `cb` is a function that takes no arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because `abortCb(err)` is a function call that passes the `err` argument to the `abortCb` function, but `cb` is a function that takes no arguments.

DONE.
