  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"tail"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return the `tail` property of the `ends.promise` object, rather than the `head` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"head" + "tail"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return the concatenation of the `head` and `tail` properties of the `ends.promise` object, rather than just the `head` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"head" + "tail" + "head"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return the concatenation of the `head`, `tail`, and `head` properties of the `ends.promise` object, rather than just the `head` property.

DONE.
