  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last element of the `nodeArgs` array, which is the callback function that is passed to the `FS.readFile` function. This would cause the function to not be called with the correct arguments, leading to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
