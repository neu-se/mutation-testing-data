 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spread` function expects an array as the second argument, and passing `null` would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'not-an-array'
