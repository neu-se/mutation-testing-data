  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!rule.clone
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the result of the clone method, potentially causing the policy to deny access when it should allow it, or allow access when it should deny it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(rule.clone + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would offset the result of the clone method by 1, potentially causing the policy to deny access when it should allow it, or allow access when it should deny it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(rule.clone === false)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the result of the clone method is false, rather than checking if it is true, potentially causing the policy to deny access when it should allow it, or allow access when it should deny it.

DONE.
