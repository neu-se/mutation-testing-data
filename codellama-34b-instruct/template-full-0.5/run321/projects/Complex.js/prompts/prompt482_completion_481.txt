  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` checks if the value is Not-a-Number, while `isFinite` checks if the value is finite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the imaginary part of the complex number is equal to zero, while `isFinite` checks if the real part is finite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the real part of the complex number is equal to zero, while `isFinite` checks if the real part is finite.

DONE.
