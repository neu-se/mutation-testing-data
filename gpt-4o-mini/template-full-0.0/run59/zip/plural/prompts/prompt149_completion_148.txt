Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.prototype.plural != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for any non-null value instead of specifically checking if `plural` is undefined, which could lead to incorrect behavior if `plural` is set to a different value (e.g., a function or an empty string).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.prototype.plural === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly checks if `plural` is strictly equal to `true`, which is not a valid state for the `plural` method, leading to the method not being added when it should be.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof String.prototype.plural === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `plural` is a function instead of checking if it is undefined, which would prevent the method from being added if it was previously set to a non-function value, even if it was not defined before.

DONE.
