  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
head.task = task;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the task to the `head.task` property, which is not the intended behavior of the `runSingle` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tail.task = task;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the task to the `tail.task` property, which is not the intended behavior of the `runSingle` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task.call(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the task function with a null context, which is not the intended behavior of the `runSingle` function.

DONE.
