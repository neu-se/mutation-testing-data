  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-input
```
This would result in different behavior because the unary minus operator is applied to the input, which would change the sign of the number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
input + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the input is incremented by 1, which would change the resulting offset.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
input * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the input is multiplied by 2, which would change the resulting offset.

DONE.
