  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'zip'
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return the string "zip" instead of the actual format of the archive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'tar'
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return the string "tar" instead of the actual format of the archive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'gzip'
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return the string "gzip" instead of the actual format of the archive.

DONE.
