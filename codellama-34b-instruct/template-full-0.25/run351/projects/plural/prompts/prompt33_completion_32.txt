  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substring
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.substring` would return a substring of `w` starting from the given index, whereas `w.substr` would return a substring of `w` starting from the given index with the given length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.slice` would return a substring of `w` starting from the given index, whereas `w.substr` would return a substring of `w` starting from the given index with the given length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'es'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a substring of `w` starting from the given index with the given length, whereas the original code fragment would return a substring of `w` starting from the given index with the given length, and then append 'es' to the end of
