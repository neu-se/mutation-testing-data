  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.value === void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `value` property of the `inspected` object would be checked for `undefined` instead of the `state` property being checked for `"fulfilled"`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state !== "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation of the `state` property being checked for `"pending"` would result in a check for either `"fulfilled"` or `"rejected"`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state !== "fulfilled" && inspected.state !== "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `state` property would be checked for any value other than `"fulfilled"` or `"rejected"`.

DONE.
