  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only matches words that end with "s," while this new code fragment would match words that end with "s" and then change them to "ies."

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only matches words that end with "s," while this new code fragment would match words that end with "s" and then change them to "es."
