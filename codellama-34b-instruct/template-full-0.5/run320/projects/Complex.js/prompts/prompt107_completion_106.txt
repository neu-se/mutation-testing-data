  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['NAN'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would return a complex number with real and imaginary parts set to `NaN`, while the modified code would return a single value of `NaN`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['INFINITY'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would return a complex number with real and imaginary parts set to `Infinity`, while the modified code would return a single value of `Infinity`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['NAN'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would return a complex number with real and imaginary parts set to `NaN`, while the modified code would return a single value of `NaN`.

DONE.
