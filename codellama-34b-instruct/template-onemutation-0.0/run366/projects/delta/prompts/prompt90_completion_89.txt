  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.retain === 'string' &&
          typeof lastOp.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if both `newOp.retain` and `lastOp.retain` are numbers, while the modified code fragment checks if both are strings. This change would cause the code to behave differently when dealing with string values.

DONE.
