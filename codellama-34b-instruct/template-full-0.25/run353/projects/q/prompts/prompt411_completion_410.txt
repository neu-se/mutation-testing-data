  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.inspect(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method is not defined on the `value` object, so it would throw a `TypeError` instead of returning the expected result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.inspect(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method is not defined on the `value` object, so it would throw a `TypeError` instead of returning the expected result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.inspect(<PLACEHOLDER>);

DONE.
