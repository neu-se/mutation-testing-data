  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` and `apply` are different methods of the `Function` object, and they have different behaviors when it comes to passing arguments to the function. `call` passes the arguments individually, while `apply` passes an array of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function that, when called, will call the original function with a specific `this` value and arguments that are provided individually.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.toString
```
This would result in different behavior because `toString` returns a string representation of the function, which can be useful for debugging or logging, but it does not execute the function.

DONE.
