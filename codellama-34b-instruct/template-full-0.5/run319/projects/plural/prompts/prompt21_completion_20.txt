  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'i' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and the function passed as the second argument is also different. The original code fragment uses a regular expression pattern that matches words that end with "nucleus", "syllabus", "focus", "fungus", or "cactus", and the function passed as the second argument returns the word with the last letter removed and an "i" added to the end. In contrast, the replaced code fragment uses a regular expression pattern that matches words that end with "nucleus", "syllabus", "focus", "fungus", "cactus", or "cacti", and the function passed as the second argument returns the word with the last letter removed and an "i" added to the end, but also removes the last letter of the word before adding
