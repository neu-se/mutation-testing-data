  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q` is a reference to the Promise constructor, and `null` would not have the same methods and properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q` is a reference to the Promise constructor, and `undefined` would not have the same methods and properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
5
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q` is a reference to the Promise constructor, and `5` would not have the same methods and properties.

DONE.
