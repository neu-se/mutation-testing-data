  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [val, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the key and value are swapped, which could cause issues in the code that uses the forEach method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, val] = [val, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the key and value are swapped, which could cause issues in the code that uses the forEach method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, val] = [key, val]
```
This would result in different behavior because the key and value are not swapped, which could cause issues in the code that uses the forEach method.

DONE.
