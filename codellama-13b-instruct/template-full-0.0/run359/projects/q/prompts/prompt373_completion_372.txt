  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.onerror` function is called when an error is thrown in the `then` callback, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror(e)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.onerror` function is called with the error as an argument, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror(e, promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.onerror` function is called with the error and the promise as arguments, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the error and the promise to be resolved with the error.

DONE.
