Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true for the `isDynamicPattern` function, as an empty string is not equal to any index, thus changing the logic of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
ESCAPE_SYMBOL + ESCAPE_SYMBOL
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the character being searched for in the `isDynamicPattern` function, potentially leading to incorrect identification of dynamic patterns.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
GLOBSTAR
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the character being searched for in the `isDynamicPattern` function to the globstar character, potentially leading to incorrect identification of dynamic patterns and affecting the overall logic of the function.

DONE.
