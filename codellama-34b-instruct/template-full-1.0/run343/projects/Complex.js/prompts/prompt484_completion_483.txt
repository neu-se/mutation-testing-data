  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
define == 'function' && define['amd']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `define` function would not be called, even if it is defined, and the `amd` property would not be accessed, even if it exists.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
define !== 'function' && define['amd']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `define` function would be called, even if it is not defined, and the `amd` property would be accessed, even if it does not exist.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
define['amd'] && define !== 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `define` function would be called, even if it is not defined, and the `amd` property would not be accessed, even if it exists.

DONE.
