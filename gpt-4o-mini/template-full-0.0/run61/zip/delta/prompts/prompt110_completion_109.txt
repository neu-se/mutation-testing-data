Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate the length of the `op` object instead of the object itself, potentially leading to incorrect partitioning of operations based on their length rather than their actual content.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `attributes` property of the `op` object for the predicate check, which may not be a boolean value, thus affecting the logic of how operations are categorized into passed and failed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!op
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `op` is falsy (null, undefined, etc.), which could lead to all operations being categorized as failed if they are valid objects, thus breaking the intended functionality of the `partition` method.

DONE.
