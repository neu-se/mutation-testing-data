 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `notify` method would not check for a condition before executing the `array_reduce` function, causing it to always execute even when there are no progress listeners.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `notify` method would not check for a condition before executing the `array_reduce` function, causing it to execute even when there are no progress listeners, and potentially throw a `TypeError` when trying to call the `push` method on `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `notify` method would not check for a condition before executing the `array_reduce` function, causing it to always execute and potentially push an empty item to the `progressListeners` array, which could lead to unexpected behavior in other parts of the code that rely on this array.
