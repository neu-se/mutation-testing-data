  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `args || []` would return an empty array if `args` is falsy, while the new code fragment `null` would return `null` in the same situation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `args || []` would return an empty array if `args` is falsy, while the new code fragment `undefined` would return `undefined` in the same situation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `args || []` would return an empty array if `args` is falsy, while the new code fragment `[]` would return an empty array regardless of the value of `args`.

DONE.
