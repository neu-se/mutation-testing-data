  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ended` is truthy, while the mutated code fragment checks if `ended` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ended` is truthy, while the mutated code fragment checks if `ended` is falsy and returns `false` if it is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended ? true : false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ended` is truthy, while the mutated code fragment checks if `ended` is falsy and returns `true` if it is.

DONE.
