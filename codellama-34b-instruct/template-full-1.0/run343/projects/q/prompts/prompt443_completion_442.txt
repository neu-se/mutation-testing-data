  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, and `typeof null === "object"` would return `false`, which means the `then` method would not be called, and the rejection would not be handled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{"value": reason}
```
This would result in different behavior because `reason` is an object, and `typeof { "value":reason }.value === "object"` would return `true`, which means the `then` method would not be called, and the rejection would not be handled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason.detail
```
This would result in different behavior because `reason.detail` is undefined, and `typeof reason.detail === "undefined"` would return `true`, which means the `then` method would not be called, and the rejection would not be handled.

DONE.
