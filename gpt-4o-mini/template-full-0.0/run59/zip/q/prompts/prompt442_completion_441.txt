Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"handledRejection"
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the event name from "unhandledRejection" to "handledRejection", which means that the promise rejection will be reported under a different event, potentially leading to confusion and incorrect handling of unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledError"
```
This would result in different behavior because it alters the event name to "unhandledError", which is not a standard event for promise rejections, causing the rejection to be reported incorrectly and possibly leading to missed error handling in the application.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejectionHandled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the event name to "unhandledRejectionHandled", which implies that the rejection has been handled, whereas the original event indicates that it was unhandled, leading to a misleading state of the promise handling.

DONE.
