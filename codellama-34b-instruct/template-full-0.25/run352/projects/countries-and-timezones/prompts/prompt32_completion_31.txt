  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getNumStr(min)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getNumStr` function is called with the `min` variable, which is a number, instead of the `offset` variable, which is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getNumStr(offset % 60)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getNumStr` function is called with the result of `offset % 60`, which is a number, instead of the `offset` variable, which is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getNumStr(offset / 60)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getNumStr` function is called with the result of `offset / 60`, which is a number, instead of the `offset` variable, which is a string.

DONE.
