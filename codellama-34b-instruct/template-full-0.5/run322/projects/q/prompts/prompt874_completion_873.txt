  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `defer` function with the argument `1`, which would likely cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(deferred)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `defer` function with the argument `deferred`, which is a promise and not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `defer` function with the argument `function() {}`, which is a function and not a promise.

DONE.
