  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(0, this.ops.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last operation from the delta, which could affect the resulting delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(1, this.ops.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first operation from the delta, which could affect the resulting delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(0, this.ops.length - 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last two operations from the delta, which could affect the resulting delta.

DONE.
