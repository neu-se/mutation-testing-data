Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(Δλ)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the calculation from using the sine of the angle to using the cosine, which will yield a different value for `y` and thus affect the final bearing calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the sine of the latitude of the first point instead of the change in longitude, which alters the calculation of `y` and can lead to incorrect bearing results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(Δλ) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the sine of the change in longitude, which will significantly distort the calculation of `y`, leading to incorrect bearing values.

DONE.
