  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred` is a local variable within the function, while `Q` is a global variable that represents the Q promise library. Using `deferred` instead of `Q` would cause the code to resolve the promise with a different value, which would likely cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is a function that rejects the promise with a given reason, while `Q` is a global variable that represents the Q promise library. Using `deferred.reject` instead of `Q` would cause the code to reject the promise with a different reason, which would likely cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a value that is not a function, while `Q` is a function that returns a promise.
