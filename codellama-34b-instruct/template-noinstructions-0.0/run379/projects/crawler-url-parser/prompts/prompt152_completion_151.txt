  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff == 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for equality with 0, which means the same number of parts in the URL path, while this replacement checks for equality with 1, which means the URL path has one more part than the original URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff == -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for equality with 0, which means the same number of parts in the URL path, while this replacement checks for equality with -1, which means the URL path has one less part than the original URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff != 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for equality with 0, which means the same number of parts in the URL path, while this replacement checks for inequality with 0, which means the URL path has a different number of parts than the
