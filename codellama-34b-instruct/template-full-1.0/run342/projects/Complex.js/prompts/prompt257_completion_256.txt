  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `b` as a positive value, whereas the replaced code fragment uses `-b` as a negative value. This could lead to incorrect results when calling the `expm1` method.
DONE.
