  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `a` is less than `Complex['EPSILON']`, while this code checks if `a` is exactly equal to 0, which may produce different results depending on the value of `Complex['EPSILON']` and the input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(a) <= Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `a` is less than `Complex['EPSILON']`, while this code checks if `a` is less than or equal to `Complex['EPSILON']`, which may produce different results depending on the input values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!a && a !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `a` is not exactly equal to 0, while this code
