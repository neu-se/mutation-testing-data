  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
min + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 to the `min` variable would cause the `getOffsetStr` function to return a string with a different offset value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
min - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 1 from the `min` variable would cause the `getOffsetStr` function to return a string with a different offset value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
min * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication of 2 by the `min` variable would cause the `getOffsetStr` function to return a string with a different offset value.

DONE.
