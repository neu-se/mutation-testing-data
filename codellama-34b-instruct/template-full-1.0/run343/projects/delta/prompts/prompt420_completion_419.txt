  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.max` returns the larger of two numbers, whereas `Math.min` returns the smaller of two numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number, which would result in a different minimum value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.round` rounds a number to the nearest integer, which would result in a different minimum value.

Please conclude your response with "DONE".
