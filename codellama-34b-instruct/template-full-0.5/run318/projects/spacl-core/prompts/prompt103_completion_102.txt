  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path + verb, ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because `path + verb` would concatenate the `path` and `verb` strings, whereas the original code fragment would pass them as separate arguments to the `policy.query()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` would be passed as the `ctx` argument to the `policy.query()` method, whereas the original code fragment would pass the `ctx` argument as is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, "different context"
```
This would result in different behavior because a different `ctx` argument would be passed to the `policy.query()` method, which could potentially change the result of the query.

DONE.
