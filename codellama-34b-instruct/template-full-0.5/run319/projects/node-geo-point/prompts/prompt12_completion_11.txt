  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type === 'Point'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `fromGeoJSON` method to always throw an error, regardless of whether the input `point` is a valid GeoJSON point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type !== 'Point' && point.type !== 'Feature'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `fromGeoJSON` method to throw an error if the input `point` is not a valid GeoJSON point or feature, but it would not throw an error if the input `point` is a valid GeoJSON feature with a `Point` geometry.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type !== 'Point' && point.type !== 'Feature' && point.type !== 'GeometryCollection'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `fromGeoJSON` method to throw an error if the input `point` is
