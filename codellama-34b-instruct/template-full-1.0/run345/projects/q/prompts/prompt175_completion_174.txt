  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice method would return a new array with the first element removed, whereas join would return a string with all the elements of the array separated by the separator argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.filter(line => line !== "From previous event:")
```
This would result in different behavior because the filter method would return a new array with only the lines that do not match the filter condition, whereas join would return a string with all the elements of the array separated by the separator argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.reduce((result, line) => result + line, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because the reduce method would concatenate all the elements of the array into a single string, whereas join would return a string with all the elements of the array separated by the separator argument.

DONE.
