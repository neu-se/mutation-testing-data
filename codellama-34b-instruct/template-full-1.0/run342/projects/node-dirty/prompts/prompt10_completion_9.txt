  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.file
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be looking for a `file` property in the `Dirty` class, which does not exist. Additionally, `this.path` is used in the `constructor` to create an instance of `fs.ReadStream`, which would not be present in the new mutated code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.settings.path
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be looking for a `path` property in a `settings` object, which is not defined anywhere in the code. Additionally, `this.path` is used in the `constructor` to create an instance of `fs.ReadStream`, which would not be present in the new mutated code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.ReadStream.path
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be trying to access the `path` property of a class, `fs.ReadStream`, which does not
