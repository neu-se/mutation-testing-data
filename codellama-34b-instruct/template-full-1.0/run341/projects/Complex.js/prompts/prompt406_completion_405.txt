  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(Math.atan2(x, y) * 100) / 100;
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of using `Math.atan2` to compute the correct result, `Math.floor` is used which would give the behavior of rounding the real component down to the nearest integer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil(Math.atan2(x, y) * 100) / 100;
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of using `Math.atan2` to compute the correct result, `Math.ceil` is used which would give the behavior of rounding the real component up to the nearest integer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round(Math.atan2(x, y) * 100) / 100;
