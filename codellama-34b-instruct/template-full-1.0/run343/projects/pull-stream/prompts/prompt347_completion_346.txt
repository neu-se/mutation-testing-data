  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data[key] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code assumes that `key` is a string and returns the value associated with that key in the `data` object. However, if `key` is an object with a reference to the `data` object, the modified code would return a different value (the value associated with the key `key` in the `data` object plus 1).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data[key][0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code assumes that `key` is a string and returns the value associated with that key in the `data` object. However, if `key` is an object with a reference to the `data` object, the modified code would return a different value (the value associated with the key `key` in the `data` object at index 0).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data[key + 'a']
```
