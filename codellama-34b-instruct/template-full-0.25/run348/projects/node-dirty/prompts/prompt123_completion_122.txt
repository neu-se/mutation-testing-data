  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include the argument `true`, which would cause the `_flush` method to be called with a different argument than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include the argument `false`, which would cause the `_flush` method to be called with a different argument than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include the argument `null`, which would cause the `_flush` method to be called with a different argument than expected.

DONE.
