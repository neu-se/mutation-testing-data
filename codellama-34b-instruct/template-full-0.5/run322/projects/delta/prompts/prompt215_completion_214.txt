  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` creates a shallow copy of the array, while `concat()` creates a new array by concatenating the two arrays.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops.splice(0, 0, other.ops)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice()` modifies the original array, while `concat()` creates a new array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops.push.apply(delta.ops, other.ops)
```
This would result in different behavior because `push()` adds elements to the end of the array, while `apply()` adds elements to the beginning of the array.

DONE.
