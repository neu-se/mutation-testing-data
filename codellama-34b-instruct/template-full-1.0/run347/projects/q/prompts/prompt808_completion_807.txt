  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` returns a rejected promise, whereas `object` returns a resolved promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer().promise` returns an unresolved promise, whereas `object` returns a resolved promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `object + 1` returns a different value than `object`, which could cause the promise to be resolved with a different value.

DONE.
