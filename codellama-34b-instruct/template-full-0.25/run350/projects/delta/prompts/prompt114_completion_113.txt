  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(op, index)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `predicate` function with the `op` and `index` arguments, which would cause the `filter` method to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op, index) => predicate(op, index)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new function that calls the `predicate` function with the `op` and `index` arguments, which would cause the `filter` method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op, index) => !predicate(op, index)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new function that negates the result of the `predicate` function, which would cause the `filter` method to return a different result.

DONE.
