  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {
    throw new Error("This is a bug");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a new `then` callback to the promise that throws an error, which would cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {
    return Q.reject("This is a bug");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a new `then` callback to the promise that returns a rejected promise with the reason "This is a bug".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {
    return Q.fulfill("This is a bug");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a new `then` callback to the promise that returns a fulfilled promise with the value "This is a bug".

DONE.
