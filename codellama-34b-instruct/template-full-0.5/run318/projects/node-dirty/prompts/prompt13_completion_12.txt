  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cbs.includes(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `includes` method checks if the callback is in the list, whereas the original code simply adds the callback to the list.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code adds the callback to the list regardless of whether the list is empty or not, whereas the modified code only adds the callback if the list is empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code adds the callback to the list regardless of whether the list is empty or not, whereas the modified code only adds the callback if the list is not empty.

DONE.
