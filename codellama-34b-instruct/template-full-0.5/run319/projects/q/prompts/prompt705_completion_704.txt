  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args
```
This would result in different behavior because `args` is a different variable than `arguments`, and it may not contain the same values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.args
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.args` is a different variable than `arguments`, and it may not contain the same values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments.slice()` returns a shallow copy of the `arguments` object, whereas `arguments` is a reference to the original object.

DONE.
