 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisOp.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it refers to the `length` property of the current `thisOp` object, rather than the `Op` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Op.length()
