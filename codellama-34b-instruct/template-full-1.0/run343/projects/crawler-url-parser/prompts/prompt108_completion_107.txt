  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the program to return `null` instead of the expected `Map` object, leading to errors and unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the program to return an empty string instead of the expected `Map` object, leading to errors and unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the program to return `undefined` instead of the expected `Map` object, leading to errors and unexpected results.

DONE.
