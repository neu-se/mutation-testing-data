  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp && typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' && lastOp.attributes
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it checks if the `attributes` property of `lastOp` is truthy instead of falsy. This could potentially cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when it should be `false`, leading to a bug.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp && typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' && lastOp.attributes === null
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it checks if the `attributes` property of `lastOp` is `null` instead of falsy. This could potentially cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when it should be `false`, leading to a bug.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp && typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' && lastOp.attributes.length === 0
```
