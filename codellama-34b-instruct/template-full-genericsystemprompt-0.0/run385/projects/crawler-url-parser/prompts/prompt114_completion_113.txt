  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (let currentUrl of urlMap.keys())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the keys of the `urlMap` object, rather than the values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (let currentUrl of urlMap.values().reverse())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the values of the `urlMap` object in reverse order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (let currentUrl of urlMap.entries())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the key-value pairs of the `urlMap` object, rather than just the values.

DONE.
