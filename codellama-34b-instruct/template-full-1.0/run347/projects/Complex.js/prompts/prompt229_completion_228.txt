  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r * 2 + a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code multiplies 2 by (r + a), while the new code multiplies r by 2 and then adds a.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r + a) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates 2.0 times (r + a), while the new code adds 1 to the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(2.0 * (r + a)) % 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates 2.0 times (r + a), while the new code calculates the remainder of dividing 2.0 times (r + a) by 2.

DONE.
