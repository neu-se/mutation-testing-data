  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === "function" && !define.amd
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the condition, causing the `define` function to be called even if `define.amd` is not defined, which could lead to unexpected errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define !== "function" || !define.amd
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `define` is not a function or if `define.amd` is not defined, which could lead to unexpected errors if `define` is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === "function" && define.amd !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `define` is a function and if `define.amd` is not undefined, which could lead to unexpected errors if `define.amd` is not defined.

DONE.
