  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"http://example.com"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `currentUrlStr` variable, which may not be a valid URL. By replacing it with a hardcoded URL, we can test the behavior of the code with a known input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"https://example.com"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `currentUrlStr` variable, which may not be a valid URL. By replacing it with a hardcoded URL with a different protocol, we can test the behavior of the code with a known input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `currentUrlStr` variable, which may not be a valid URL. By replacing it with `null`, we can test the behavior of the code with a null input.

DONE.
