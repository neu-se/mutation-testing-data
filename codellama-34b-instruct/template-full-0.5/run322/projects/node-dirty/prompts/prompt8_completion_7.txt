  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(val)
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify()` would convert the value to a string, which may not be what the code intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value, which may not be what the code intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the value by 2, which may not be what the code intended.

DONE.
