  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(function() { throw new Error("Test error"); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error in the `then` callback, which would cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(function() { return Q.reject("Test error"); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a rejected promise with the reason "Test error".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(function() { return Q.resolve("Test value"); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a resolved promise with the value "Test value".

DONE.
