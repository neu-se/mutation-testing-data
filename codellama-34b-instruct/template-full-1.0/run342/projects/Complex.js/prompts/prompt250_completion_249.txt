  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` and `Math.cos` have different mathematical formulas and thus produce different outputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` generates a random number between 0 and 1, and `Math.cos` and `Math.sin` expect a numerical input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var c = Math.random(); Math.cos(c) + Math.sin(c)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos(c) + Math.sin(c)` is a different formula from `Math.cos` and `Math.sin` and thus would produce different outputs.

DONE.
