  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isPromise(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the result of the `isPromise` function, causing the `if` statement to execute the opposite branch.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPromiseAlike` function checks if the value is an object with a `then` method, which is a more general check than `isPromise`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFulfilled(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFulfilled` function checks if the value is a fulfilled promise, which is a more specific check than `isPromise`.

DONE.
