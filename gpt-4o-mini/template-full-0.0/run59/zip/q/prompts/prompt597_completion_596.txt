Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("get", args);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the operation from whatever `op` was intended to a fixed "get" operation, potentially leading to incorrect behavior if the caller intended to perform a different operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch(op, [args]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps `args` in an array, which may not match the expected argument structure for the `dispatch` method, leading to unexpected results or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch(op, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes `null` as the arguments instead of the intended `args`, which could cause the operation to fail or behave incorrectly due to missing parameters.

DONE.
