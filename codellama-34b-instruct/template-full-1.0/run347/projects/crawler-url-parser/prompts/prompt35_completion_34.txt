  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
paseurl.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the pathname of the URL instead of the entire URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace("http", "ftp")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace "http" with "ftp" in the URL, changing the protocol.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.split("/")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the URL into an array of strings using "/" as a delimiter.

DONE.
