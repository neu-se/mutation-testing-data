  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'c'
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting word would be "celloc" instead of "cellos", which would not be the expected plural form of the word "cello".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'celloes'
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting word would be "celloeses" instead of "celloes", which would not be the expected plural form of the word "cello".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cellos'
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting word would be "cellos" instead of "cello", which would not be the expected plural form of the word "cello".

DONE.
