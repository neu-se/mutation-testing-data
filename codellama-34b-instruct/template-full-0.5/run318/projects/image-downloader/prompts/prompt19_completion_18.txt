  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isRelative(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.isRelative()` checks if a path is relative, not absolute, and the original code fragment uses `path.isAbsolute()` to check if a path is absolute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!path.extname(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.extname()` returns the extension of a path, and the original code fragment uses `path.isAbsolute()` to check if a path is absolute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.startsWith('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because `startsWith()` checks if a string starts with a given substring, and the original code fragment uses `path.isAbsolute()` to check if a path is absolute.

DONE.
