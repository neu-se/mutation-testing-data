  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always execute the code inside the if statement, regardless of the value of `messages`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only execute the code inside the if statement if `resolvedPromise` is a boolean with the value `true`, but `resolvedPromise` is initially an empty array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only execute the code inside the if statement if `resolvedPromise` is an empty array, but `resolvedPromise` is initially an empty array.

DONE.
