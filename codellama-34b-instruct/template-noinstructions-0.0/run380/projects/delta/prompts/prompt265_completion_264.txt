  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push(otherOp).retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` is a different operation than `delete`, and it would change the meaning of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push(otherOp).insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` is a different operation than `delete`, and it would change the meaning of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push(otherOp).retain(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain(0)` is a different operation than `delete`, and it would change the meaning of the code.

DONE.
