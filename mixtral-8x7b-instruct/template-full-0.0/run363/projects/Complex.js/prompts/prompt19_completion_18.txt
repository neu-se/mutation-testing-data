 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always consider the absolute value of `b` as 0, affecting the calculation of the hypotenuse.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would lead to division by zero when `b` is 0, causing the function to throw an exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce randomness in the calculation, making the function's output unpredictable and inconsistent.

DONE.
