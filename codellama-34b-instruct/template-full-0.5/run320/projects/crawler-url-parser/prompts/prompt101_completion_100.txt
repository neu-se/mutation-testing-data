  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set
```
This would result in different behavior because `urlMap.set` would always return `undefined`, whereas `urlMap.get` would return the value associated with the given key in the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.size
```
This would result in different behavior because `urlMap.size` would return the number of elements in the map, whereas `urlMap.get` would return the value associated with the given key in the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.clear
```
This would result in different behavior because `urlMap.clear` would remove all elements from the map, whereas `urlMap.get` would return the value associated with the given key in the map.

DONE.
