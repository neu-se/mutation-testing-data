  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolvedPromise` object would be passed to the `promiseDispatch` method instead of the `resolvedPromise` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nextTick(function () {
    resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch.apply(resolvedPromise, args);
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` method would be called asynchronously using `Q.nextTick`, which would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to be called after the `valueOf` method has returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nextTick(function () {
    resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch.apply(resolvedPromise, args);
})
```
