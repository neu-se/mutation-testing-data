  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new array with the first element removed, which could cause the `JSON.parse` method to fail if the data is not valid JSON.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new string with all characters converted to uppercase, which could cause the `JSON.parse` method to fail if the data is not valid JSON.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new array with each character of the string as an element, which could cause the `JSON.parse` method to fail if the data is not valid JSON.

DONE.
