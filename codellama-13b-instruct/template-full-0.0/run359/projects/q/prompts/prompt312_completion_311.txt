  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
answerPs[i].then(resolve, reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved or rejected based on the outcome of the `then` method, rather than the original code which would resolve or reject based on the outcome of the `Q` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
answerPs[i].catch(reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected if the `catch` method is called, rather than the original code which would reject the promise if an exception is thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
answerPs[i].finally(resolve);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved or rejected based on the outcome of the `finally` method, rather than the original code which would resolve or reject based on the outcome of the `Q` method.

DONE.
