  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` method would not be able to access the `attributes` property of `baseOp`, which is necessary for the method to function correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` method would be trying to access the `insert` property of `baseOp`, which is not a valid property and would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` method would be trying to access the `ops` property of `other`, which is not a valid property and would cause an error.

DONE.
