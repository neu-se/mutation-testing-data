  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would be matched against the entire string, rather than just the beginning of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^\//)
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would be matched against the beginning of the string, rather than just the beginning of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would be matched against the entire string, rather than just the beginning of the string.

DONE.
