  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_hasOwnProperty` function would return `false` for `null`, even though `null` is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_hasOwnProperty` function would return `false` for `undefined`, even though `undefined` is a primitive value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_hasOwnProperty` function would return `false` for an empty object, even though it is an object.

DONE.
