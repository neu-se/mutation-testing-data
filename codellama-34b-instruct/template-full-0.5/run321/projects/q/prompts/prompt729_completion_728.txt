  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of promises without the first promise, which could cause the `all` function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.concat(Q.resolve(42))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an additional promise to the array of promises, which could cause the `all` function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.map(function(promise) { return promise.then(function(value) { return value * 2; }); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the value of each promise, which could cause the `all` function to return a different value.

DONE.
