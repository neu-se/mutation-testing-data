 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekType()` method would return the string 'delete' instead of the actual type of the next operation, potentially causing the function to skip over deletions in the input operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.next().type
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately consume the next operation from the iterator, rather than peeking at it. This could cause the function to behave incorrectly if there are multiple consecutive operations of the same type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random() > 0.5 ? 'insert' : 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would randomly choose between treating the next operation as an insertion or a retention, rather than correctly identifying the actual type of the operation. This could cause the function to produce incorrect results or skip over operations entirely.
