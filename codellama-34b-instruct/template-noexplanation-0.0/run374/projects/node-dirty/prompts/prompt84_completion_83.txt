  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\r'
```
This will cause the `split` method to split the string at every carriage return character, rather than every newline character. This will likely cause the `forEach` loop to iterate over the wrong elements, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\t'
```
This will cause the `split` method to split the string at every tab character, rather than every newline character. This will likely cause the `forEach` loop to iterate over the wrong elements, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This will cause the `split` method to split the string at every empty string, which will likely cause the `forEach` loop to iterate over the wrong elements, leading to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
