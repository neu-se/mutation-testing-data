  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys(a)` returns an array of the keys in the `a` object, while `attributes` returns an object with the same keys and values as `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys(b)` returns an array of the keys in the `b` object, while `attributes` returns an object with the same keys and values as `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(a).concat(Object.keys(b))
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys(a).concat(Object.keys(b))` returns an array of the keys in both `a` and `b`, while `attributes` returns an object with the same keys and values as `a` and `b`.

DONE.
