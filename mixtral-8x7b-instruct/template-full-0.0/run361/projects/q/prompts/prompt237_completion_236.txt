 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `valueOf` method would always return `promise` instead of checking if the promise has been resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `valueOf` method would always return the `promise` object instead of checking if the promise has been resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
messages.length
