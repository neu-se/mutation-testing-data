 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` not only returns the deleted elements but also changes the original array, whereas `slice` returns a new array without modifying the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.concat
