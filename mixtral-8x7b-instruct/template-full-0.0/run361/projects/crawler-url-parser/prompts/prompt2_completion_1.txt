 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'str'.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression in `_has_illegal_chars` function expects a string without any transformation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
str.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_has_illegal_chars` function expects a string, not an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
str.replace(/[^a-z0-9\:\/\?\#\[\]\@\!\$\&\'\(\)\*\+\,\;\=\.\-\_\~\%]/i, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_has_illegal_chars` function is supposed to return true if the string contains any illegal characters, but this replacement would remove those characters instead.

DONE.
