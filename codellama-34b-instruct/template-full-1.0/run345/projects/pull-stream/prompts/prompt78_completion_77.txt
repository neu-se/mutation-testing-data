  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Dummy error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would continue to iterate through the loop, but the modified code would throw an error and stop execution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would continue to iterate through the loop, but the modified code would return from the function and stop execution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
break
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would continue to iterate through the loop, but the modified code would exit the loop and stop execution.

DONE.
