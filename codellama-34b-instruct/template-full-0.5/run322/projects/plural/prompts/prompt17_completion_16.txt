  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/x$|ch$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression has been modified to only match words that end with "x" or "ch", instead of also matching words that end with "s". This would cause the pluralization of words that end with "s" to fail, as the rule would no longer match.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/x$|ch$|s$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression has been modified to also match words that end with "s", in addition to words that end with "x" or "ch". This would cause the pluralization of words that end with "s" to succeed, as the rule would now match.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/x$|ch$|s
