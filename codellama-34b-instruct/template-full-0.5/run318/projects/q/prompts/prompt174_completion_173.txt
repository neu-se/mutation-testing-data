  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add 1 to the line number, whereas the original code only adds 1 if the line number is odd.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always subtract 1 from the line number, whereas the original code only subtracts 1 if the line number is even.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always double the line number, whereas the original code only adds 1 if the line number is odd or subtracts 1 if the line number is even.

DONE.
