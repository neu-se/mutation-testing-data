  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this['re'] === Infinity;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the complex number is infinite, while this code checks if the real part is equal to infinity.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this['im'] === Infinity;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the complex number is infinite, while this code checks if the imaginary part is equal to infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this['re'] === -Infinity;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the complex number is infinite, while this code checks if the real part is equal to negative infinity.

DONE.
