  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `arguments` directly, while the new code fragment uses `array_slice(arguments, 1)` which returns a new array containing all elements of `arguments` except the first one. This change would cause the function to behave differently when it is called with a variable number of arguments.
