  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
this.ops.slice(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.ops.slice(-1)` would return the last element of the `ops` array, whereas `this.ops.pop` would remove and return the last element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
this.ops.splice(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.ops.splice(-1)` would remove the last element of the `ops` array and return a new array with the removed element, whereas `this.ops.pop` would only remove the last element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
this.ops.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.ops.shift()` would remove and return the first element of the `ops` array, whereas `this.ops.pop` would remove and return the last element.

DONE.
