  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be adding one to the opLength, which would cause the loop to iterate one more time than it should, potentially resulting in an infinite loop or other unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be subtracting one from the opLength, which would cause the loop to iterate one fewer times than it should, potentially resulting in the loop being skipped entirely or other unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be multiplying the opLength by two, which would cause the loop to iterate twice as many times as it should, potentially resulting in an infinite loop or other unexpected behavior.

DONE.
