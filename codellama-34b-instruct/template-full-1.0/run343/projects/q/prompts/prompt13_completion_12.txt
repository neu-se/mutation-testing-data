  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.notok()
```
This would result in different behavior because `notok` is a function that always returns `false`, whereas `ok` is a function that returns `true` if the current context is a SES context and `false` otherwise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.isNodeJS()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNodeJS` is a function that returns `true` if the current context is a Node.js context and `false` otherwise, whereas `ok` is a function that returns `true` if the current context is a SES context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.hasStacks()
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasStacks` is a function that returns `true` if the current context has a call stack and `false` otherwise, whereas `ok` is a function that returns `true` if the current context is a SES context.
