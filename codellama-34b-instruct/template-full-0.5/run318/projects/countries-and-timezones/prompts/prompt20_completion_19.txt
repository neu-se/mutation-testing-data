  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the existence of the `timezone` variable, while this code fragment checks if the `timezone` variable is null. If the `timezone` variable is not null, but has a falsey value (such as an empty string or 0), the original code would return `null`, while this code fragment would return the result of the `buildTimezone` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!timezone.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `timezone` variable is falsy, while this code fragment checks if the `timezone` variable has a length of 0. If the `timezone` variable is not falsy, but has a length of 0, the original code would return `null`, while this code fragment would return the result of the `buildTimezone` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
