  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg']
```
This would result in different behavior because `arg` is a different property than `phi`, and it is not clear what the intention of the code is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['abs']
```
This would result in different behavior because `abs` is a different property than `phi`, and it is not clear what the intention of the code is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because `re` is a different property than `phi`, and it is not clear what the intention of the code is.

DONE.
