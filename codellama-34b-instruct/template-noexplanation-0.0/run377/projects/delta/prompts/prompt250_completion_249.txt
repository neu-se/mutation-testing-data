  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This change will cause the `diff()` method to always add an extra character to the `retDelta` when the `component[0]` is `diff.EQUAL`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This change will cause the `diff()` method to always remove an extra character from the `retDelta` when the `component[0]` is `diff.EQUAL`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This change will cause the `diff()` method to always double the number of characters in the `retDelta` when the `component[0]` is `diff.EQUAL`.

DONE.
