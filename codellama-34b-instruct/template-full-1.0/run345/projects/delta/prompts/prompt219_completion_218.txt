  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops > other.ops
```
This would result in different behavior because the mutation testing would indicate that the test suite is not effective in detecting issues with the `reduce` method, as the condition `this.ops === other.ops` would always evaluate to `false` and the method would never be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops < other.ops
```
This would result in different behavior because the mutation testing would indicate that the test suite is not effective in detecting issues with the `reduce` method, as the condition `this.ops === other.ops` would always evaluate to `true` and the method would never be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops !== other.ops
```
This would result in different behavior because the mutation testing would indicate that the test suite is not effective in detecting issues with the `reduce` method, as the condition `this.ops === other.ops` would always
