  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index in this
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the index is in the array, while the modified code fragment checks if the index is in the array and the value at that index is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index in this && this[index]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the index is in the array, while the modified code fragment checks if the index is in the array and the value at that index is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index in this && this[index] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the index is in the array, while the modified code fragment checks if the index is in the array and the value at that index is not undefined.

DONE.
