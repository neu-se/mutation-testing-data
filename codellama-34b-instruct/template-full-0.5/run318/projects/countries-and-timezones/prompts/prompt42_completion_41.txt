  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [id]: getTimezone(id, options) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the `getTimezone` function instead of the `getCountry` function, which would return a different set of data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [id]: getCountry(id, { deprecated: true }) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes an additional option to the `getCountry` function, which would return a different set of data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [id]: getCountry(id, options) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the `getCountry` function with a different set of options, which would return a different set of data.

DONE.
