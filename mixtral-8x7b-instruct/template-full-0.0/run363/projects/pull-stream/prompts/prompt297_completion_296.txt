 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(true, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would forcefully terminate the read operation and pass an error to the callback, even if the item passed the test.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.exit(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would terminate the entire Node.js process, rather than just the read operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
last = true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the function to always return the last item that passed the test, even if there are more items that could be read.

DONE.
