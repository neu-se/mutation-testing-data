  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 1)])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function is not defined in the code snippet, and it would cause a `ReferenceError` when the code is executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, arguments])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is not an array, and it would cause a `TypeError` when the `array_slice` function is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, [arguments]])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is not an array, and it would cause a `TypeError` when the `array_slice` function is called.

DONE.
