  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the distance, which would cause the destination point to be calculated incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the distance, which would cause the destination point to be calculated incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would halve the distance, which would cause the destination point to be calculated incorrectly.

DONE.
