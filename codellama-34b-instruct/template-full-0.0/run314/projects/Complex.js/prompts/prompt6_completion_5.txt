  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the unary negation operator, which returns the negative of the operand, while the replacement code fragment uses the binary subtraction operator, which subtracts the right operand from the left operand.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the unary negation operator, which returns the negative of the operand, while the replacement code fragment uses the binary multiplication operator, which multiplies the left operand by the right operand.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1 * x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the unary negation operator, which returns the negative of the operand, while the replacement code fragment uses the binary multiplication operator, which multiplies the left operand by the right operand.

DONE.
