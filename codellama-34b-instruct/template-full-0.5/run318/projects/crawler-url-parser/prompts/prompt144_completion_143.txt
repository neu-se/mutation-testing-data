  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression now matches a different pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag is now included, which causes the regular expression to match all occurrences in the string, rather than just the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag is now included, which causes the regular expression to match case-insensitively.

DONE.
