  Option 1: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
typeof b != 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof b` returns a string representing the type of `b`, and `b` is an object, so the comparison will always be false. However, the original code checks whether `b` is of type object using `typeof b === 'object'`, which checks the type of `b` properly.

Option 2: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
b instanceof Object
```
This would result in different behavior because `b instanceof Object` checks whether `b` is an instance of the `Object` constructor, which means `b` is not an object if it is a primitive value. However, the original code uses `typeof b === 'object'`, which checks whether `b` is of type object, which includes primitive values that are objects, such as `null` and `undefined`.

Option 3: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(b) === '[object Object]'
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString
