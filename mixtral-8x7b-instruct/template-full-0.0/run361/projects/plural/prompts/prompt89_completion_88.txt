 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'persons', 'people'
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would incorrectly map the singular form "person" to "persons" instead of "people".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'person', 'peoples'
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would incorrectly map the plural form "people" to "peoples" instead of "people".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'people', 'person'
