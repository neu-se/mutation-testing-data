  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `!resolve` is the logical negation of `resolve`, which means that the promise will be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve(null)` is a call to the `resolve` function with a `null` argument, which means that the promise will be resolved with a value of `null` instead of the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve(undefined)` is a call to the `resolve` function with an `undefined` argument, which means that the promise will be resolved with a value of `undefined` instead of the expected value.

DONE.
