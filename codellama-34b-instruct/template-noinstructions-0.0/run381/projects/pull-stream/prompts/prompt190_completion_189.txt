  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `!map` checks if `map` is falsy, while `map === null` checks if `map` is strictly equal to `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `!map` checks if `map` is falsy, while `map === undefined` checks if `map` is strictly equal to `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `!map` checks if `map` is falsy, while `map === 0` checks if `map` is strictly equal to `0`.

DONE.
