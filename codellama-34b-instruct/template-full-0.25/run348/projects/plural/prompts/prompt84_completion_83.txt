  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mouses'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the plural form of the word "mouse," which is "mice," but the new code fragment returns the word "mouses," which is not a valid plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mouse'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the plural form of the word "mouse," which is "mice," but the new code fragment returns the word "mouse," which is not the plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mice'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the plural form of the word "mouse," which is "mice," but the new code fragment returns the word "mice," which is the same as the original code fragment.

DONE.
