  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err instanceof Function
```
This would result in different behavior because `err instanceof Function` checks if `err` is an instance of the `Function` class, which is not necessarily the same as checking if `err` is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof err === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof err === 'function'` checks if `err` is a function, but it does not check if `err` is an instance of the `Function` class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.constructor === Function
```
This would result in different behavior because `err.constructor === Function` checks if `err` was created by the `Function` constructor, which is not necessarily the same as checking if `err` is a function.

DONE.
