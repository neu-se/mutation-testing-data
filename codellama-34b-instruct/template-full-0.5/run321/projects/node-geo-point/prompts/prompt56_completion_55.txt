  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `cos` function to calculate the bearing, but the new code fragment is using the `sin` function. This would cause the bearing calculation to be incorrect, which could lead to unexpected results in the application.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `cos` function to calculate the bearing, but the new code fragment is using the `cos` function with a different argument (`φ2`). This would cause the bearing calculation to be incorrect, which could lead to unexpected results in the application.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `cos` function to calculate the bearing, but the new code fragment is using the `sin` function with a different argument (`φ1`). This would cause the bearing calculation to be
