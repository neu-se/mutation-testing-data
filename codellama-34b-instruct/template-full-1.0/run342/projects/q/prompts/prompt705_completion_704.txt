  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is empty, while `arguments` contains the arguments passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the current execution context, while `arguments` refers to the arguments passed to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, while `arguments` is an object that contains the arguments passed to the function.

DONE.
