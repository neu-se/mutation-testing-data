  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the result of the `isInfinite` method, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when the divisor is not infinite, rather than `false` as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` method checks if the value is not a number, rather than if it is infinite. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when the divisor is not a number, rather than `false` as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite` method checks if the value is a finite number, rather than if it is infinite. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when the divisor is a
