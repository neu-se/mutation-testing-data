  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength()` returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, while `peekType()` returns the type of the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekLength()` returns the length of the next operation in the other iterator, while `thisIter.peekType()` returns the type of the next operation in the current iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.peekLength() + otherIter.peekLength()` would return the sum of the lengths of the next operations in both iterators, while `thisIter.peekType()` returns the type of the next operation in the current iterator.

DONE.
