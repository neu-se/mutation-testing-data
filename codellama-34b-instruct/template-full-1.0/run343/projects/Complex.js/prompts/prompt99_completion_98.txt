  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"INVALID"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parseFloat()` method is expected to return a numerical value, but instead, it returns a string that would cause the program to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3.4780178737037204e-10
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parseFloat()` method is expected to return a numerical value, but instead, it returns a value that is very close to zero, which would cause the program to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parseFloat()` method is expected to return a numerical value, but instead, it returns a value that is very close to pi, which would cause the program to fail.

DONE.
