  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` is a function that resolves a promise, whereas `deferred.reject` is a function that rejects a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` is a function that notifies the promise of progress, whereas `deferred.reject` is a function that rejects a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject(new Error())` is a function that rejects a promise with a new error, whereas `deferred.reject` is a function that rejects a promise with the original error.

DONE.
