  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance to the next operation, potentially skipping over operations that should be included in the resulting delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(otherIter.peekLength());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance to the next operation, potentially skipping over operations that should be included in the resulting delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(otherIter.peekLength() - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance to the next operation, potentially skipping over operations that should be included in the resulting delta.

DONE.
