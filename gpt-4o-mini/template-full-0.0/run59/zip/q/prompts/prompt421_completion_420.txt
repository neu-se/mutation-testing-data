Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object instanceof Object
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly identify any object as fulfilled, including non-promise objects, leading to false positives in the `isFulfilled` check.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat `null` as a fulfilled value, which is not the intended behavior since `null` should not be considered a fulfilled promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly return `true` for pending promises, thus failing to identify fulfilled promises correctly, leading to incorrect results in the `isFulfilled` check.

DONE.
