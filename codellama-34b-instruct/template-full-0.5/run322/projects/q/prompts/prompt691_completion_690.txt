  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [this, array_slice(arguments)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` argument would be different, potentially causing the method to be called on a different object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` is different, potentially causing the method to be called with different arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call", [void 0, array_slice(arguments)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the method would be called with the `call` method instead of the `apply` method, potentially causing the method to be called with different arguments.

DONE.
