  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `directory` method would always return `true`, regardless of whether the directory exists or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `directory` method would always return the string `'foo'`, regardless of whether the directory exists or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `directory` method would always return `null`, regardless of whether the directory exists or not.

DONE.
