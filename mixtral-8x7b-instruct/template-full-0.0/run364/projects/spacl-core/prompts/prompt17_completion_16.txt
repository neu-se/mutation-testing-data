 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
(spec: any, version: any = '1.1') => { /* ... */ }
```
This would result in different behavior because it allows any value for `spec` and `version`, potentially causing unexpected errors or incorrect functionality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
(spec: string, version: string = '1.1') => { /* ... */ }
```
This would result in different behavior because it allows any string value for `version`, potentially causing unexpected errors or incorrect functionality if an invalid version is provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
(spec: string, version: '1' | '1.0' | '1.1' = '1.1') => { /* ... */ }
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the type checking for `version`, allowing any string value for `version`. This would potentially cause unexpected errors or incorrect functionality if an invalid version is provided
