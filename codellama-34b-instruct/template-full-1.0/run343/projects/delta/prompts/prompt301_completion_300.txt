  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i++
```
This would result in different behavior because `i` would be incremented before it is used as an index, which would change the behavior of the `eachLine` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
--i
```
This would result in different behavior because `i` would be decremented before it is used as an index, which would change the behavior of the `eachLine` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `i` would be incremented after it is used as an index, which would change the behavior of the `eachLine` method.

DONE.
