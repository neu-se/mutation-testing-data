  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is only called when the `ended` variable is true, but in this new code fragment, `cb` is called unconditionally.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err || true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is only called when the `ended` variable is true, but in this new code fragment, `cb` is called with a different argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(ended, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is only called with a single argument, but in this new code fragment, `cb` is called with two arguments.

DONE.
