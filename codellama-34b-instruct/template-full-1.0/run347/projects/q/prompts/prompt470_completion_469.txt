  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.catch(function(){})
```
This would result in different behavior because the catch block would swallow any errors that may occur during the resolution of the promise, which could lead to unhandled rejections that would not be reported.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(){})
```
This would result in different behavior because the then block would be called twice for each resolution of the promise, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the code inside the block is not idempotent.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.finally(function(){})
```
This would result in different behavior because the finally block would be called every time the promise is resolved or rejected, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the code inside the block is not designed to handle both cases.

DONE.
