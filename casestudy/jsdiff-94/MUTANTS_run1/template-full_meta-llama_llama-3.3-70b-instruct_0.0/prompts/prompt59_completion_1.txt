Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
oldEOFNewline && newEOFNewline
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if both the old and new strings have a newline at the end, which is the opposite of the original condition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!oldEOFNewline || newEOFNewline
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a logical OR operator instead of the original logical AND and OR operators, changing the conditions under which the newline message is added.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
noNlBeforeAdds
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if there are no newlines before adds, ignoring the newline status of the old and new strings, which could lead to incorrect handling of newline characters.

DONE.
