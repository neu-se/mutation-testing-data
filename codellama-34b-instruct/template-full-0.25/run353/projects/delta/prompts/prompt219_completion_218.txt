  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops !== other.ops
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the comparison, causing the `invert` method to return a delta that is the opposite of the original delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length !== other.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the length of the two arrays, rather than the contents of the arrays.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.some((op) => !other.ops.includes(op))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if any of the operations in `this.ops` are not present in `other.ops`, rather than checking if the two arrays are equal.

DONE.
