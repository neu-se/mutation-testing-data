  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify` returns a string representation of the object, whereas `JSON.parse` parses a string and returns the corresponding object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(content, options.reviver)
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.parse` expects a string as its first argument, whereas `content` is already a parsed object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
require('./utils').parse
```
This would result in different behavior because `require('./utils').parse` is a different function than `JSON.parse`, and may have different behavior or different arguments.

DONE.
