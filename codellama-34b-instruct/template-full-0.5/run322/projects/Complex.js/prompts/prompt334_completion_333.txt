  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `>` operator would cause the function to return a different value for negative values of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator would cause the function to return a different value for `b` that is not equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator would cause the function to return a different value for `b` that is equal to 1.

DONE.
