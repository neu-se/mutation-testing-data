  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `.startsWith()` checks if the string starts with the given substring, while `.includes()` checks if the string contains the substring. In this case, `.startsWith()` would return `false` for the input `"sub.domain.com/aaa/bbb/ccc"`, while `.includes()` would return `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.endsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `.endsWith()` checks if the string ends with the given substring, while `.includes()` checks if the string contains the substring. In this case, `.endsWith()` would return `false` for the input `"sub.domain.com/aaa/bbb/ccc"`, while `.includes()` would return `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `.indexOf()` checks if the string
