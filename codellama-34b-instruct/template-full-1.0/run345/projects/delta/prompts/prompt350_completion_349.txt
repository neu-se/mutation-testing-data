  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes.invert()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert()` method returns a new attribute map with the same attributes as `op.attributes` but with the values inverted, while the original code fragment returns the actual attributes of the operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property returns the number of attributes in the attribute map, while the original code fragment returns the actual attributes of the operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method returns a string representation of the attribute map, while the original code fragment returns the actual attributes of the operation.

DONE.
