  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push(newOp.insert);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only push the `insert` property of the `newOp` object, rather than the entire `newOp` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push(newOp.retain);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only push the `retain` property of the `newOp` object, rather than the entire `newOp` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push(newOp.delete);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only push the `delete` property of the `newOp` object, rather than the entire `newOp` object.

DONE.
