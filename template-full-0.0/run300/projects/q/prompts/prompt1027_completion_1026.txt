  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!nodeback
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the truthiness of `nodeback`, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `nodeback` is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would attempt to add `1` to `nodeback`, which is a function, causing a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `()` operator would attempt to call `nodeback` as a function, potentially causing a `TypeError` to be thrown if `nodeback` is not a function.

DONE.
