  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.thenResolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.thenResolve()` is a function that returns a promise, whereas `object` is a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.thenReject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.thenReject()` is a function that returns a promise that is rejected, whereas `object` is a promise that is fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.then(function() { throw reason; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.then(function() { throw reason; })` is a function that returns a promise that is rejected with the specified reason, whereas `object` is a promise that is fulfilled.

DONE.
