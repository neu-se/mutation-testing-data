  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData.length, baseOpData.length
```
This would result in different behavior because now the opData and baseOpData will have different lengths, which will affect the output of the embedding function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"opData", baseOpData
```
This would result in different behavior because now the opData will be treated as a string literal, which will not have the same properties and methods as the original opData object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max(opData, baseOpData)
```
This would result in different behavior because now the maximum of the two objects will be returned, which will not be the same as the original object.

DONE.
