 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.index > this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always skip the length assignment, causing the function to return Infinity when there are no more operations left.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
typeof length === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only assign Infinity when the length argument is not provided, instead of checking if it's not provided or explicitly set to undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
length !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly assign Infinity when the length argument is set to null, which is not the same as not providing the argument.

DONE.
