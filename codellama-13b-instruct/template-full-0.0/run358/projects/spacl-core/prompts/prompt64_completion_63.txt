  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.push(new Rule())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a new rule to the policy, which would change the behavior of the `query` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.push(new Rule(path, verb, ctx))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a new rule to the policy with the same path, verb, and context as the original rule, which would change the behavior of the `query` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.push(new Rule(path, verb, ctx, true))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a new rule to the policy with the same path, verb, and context as the original rule, but with a different `allow` value, which would change the behavior of the `query` method.

DONE.
