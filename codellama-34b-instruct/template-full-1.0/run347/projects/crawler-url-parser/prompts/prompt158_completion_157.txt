  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regular expression would cause the regular expression to match all occurrences of the pattern in the input string, rather than just the first occurrence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/m
```
This would result in different behavior because the `m` flag at the end of the regular expression would cause the regular expression to match multiple lines in the input string, rather than just the first line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?[^$]/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `[^$]` at the end of the regular expression would cause the regular expression to match all characters that are not the dollar sign (`$`) at the end of the string, rather than just the first character that is
