  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace("http://", "https://")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace all instances of "http://" with "https://" in the base URL string, which could potentially change the URL's protocol and cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last character of the base URL string, which could potentially change the URL's path and cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.split("/")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the base URL string into an array of substrings using "/" as the delimiter, and then return the first element of the array, which could potentially change the URL's hostname and cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
