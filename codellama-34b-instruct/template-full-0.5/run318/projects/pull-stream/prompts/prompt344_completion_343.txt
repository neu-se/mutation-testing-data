  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort && (abort === true ? null: abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if `onAbort` is truthy, while this new fragment checks if `abort` is strictly equal to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort && (abort === false ? null: abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if `onAbort` is truthy, while this new fragment checks if `abort` is strictly equal to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort && (abort !== true ? null: abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if `onAbort` is truthy, while this new fragment checks if `abort` is not strictly equal to `true`.

DONE.
