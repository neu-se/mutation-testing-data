  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, name.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the `name` string to uppercase, which could cause the `buildTimezone` function to return a different timezone object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, name.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of a string returns the number of characters in the string, which could cause the `buildTimezone` function to return a different timezone object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, name.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method returns an array of substrings, which could cause the `buildTimezone` function to return a different timezone object.

DONE.
