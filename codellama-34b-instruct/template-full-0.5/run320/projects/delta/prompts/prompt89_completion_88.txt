  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `newOp.attributes` is an object, while this replacement checks if it is not null. This could cause the code to behave differently if `newOp.attributes` is a non-object value that is not null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.attributes === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `newOp.attributes` is an object, while this replacement checks if it is a function. This could cause the code to behave differently if `newOp.attributes` is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes.hasOwnProperty('length')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `newOp.attributes` is an object, while this replacement checks if it has a `length` property. This could cause the code to behave differently if `new
