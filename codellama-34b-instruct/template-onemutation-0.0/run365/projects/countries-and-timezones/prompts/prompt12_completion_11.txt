  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] = { current: [], all: [] };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always reset the `current` and `all` arrays for each country, instead of only resetting them if they are not already defined. This would cause the `buildCountry` function to always return an object with empty `current` and `all` arrays, even if the `data` object contains timezones for the country.
