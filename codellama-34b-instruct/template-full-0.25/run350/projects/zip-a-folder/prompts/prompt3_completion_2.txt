  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{src, targetFilePath: tarFilePath, format: 'zip', zipAFolderOptions}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `format` property is changed from `'tar'` to `'zip'`, which would result in a different compression algorithm being used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{src, targetFilePath: tarFilePath, format: 'tar', zipAFolderOptions: {compression: COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed}}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compression` property is changed from the default value of `COMPRESSION_LEVEL.high` to `COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed`, which would result in a different compression level being used.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{src, targetFilePath: tarFilePath, format: 'tar', zipAFolderOptions: {customWriteStream: fs.createWriteStream(targetFilePath)}}
