  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error && "string" === typeof error
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `error` is not undefined or null, while this code fragment checks if `error` is defined and is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error || "string" !== typeof error
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `error` is not undefined or null, and if it is a string. This code fragment checks if `error` is defined, and if it is not a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error || "string" === typeof error
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `error` is not undefined or null, and if it is a string. This code fragment checks if `error` is defined, and if it is a string.

DONE.
