  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `0`

This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method will return a shallow copy of the array's elements, starting from the index `0` instead of from the index `start`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `unhandledRejections.length`

This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method will return a shallow copy of the array's elements, up to the length of the array `unhandledRejections` instead of up to the index `end`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `Math.max(unhandledRejections.length, start)`

This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method will return a shallow copy of the array's elements, up to the length of the array `unhandledRejections` or up to the index `start`, whichever is larger.

DONE.
