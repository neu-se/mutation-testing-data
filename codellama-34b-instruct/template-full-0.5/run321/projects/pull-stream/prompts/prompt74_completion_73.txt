  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(abort && true) || true`, which would always result in `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator has higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(!abort || true) && true`, which would always result in `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(abort || true) && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the parentheses would group the `abort || true` expression together, so the expression would be evaluated as `(abort || true) && true`, which would always result in `true`.

DONE.
