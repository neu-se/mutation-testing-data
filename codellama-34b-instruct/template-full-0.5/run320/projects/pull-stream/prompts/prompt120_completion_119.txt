  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end !== true ? end : null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `null` when `end` is not `true`, rather than returning `end` when it is not `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === false ? null : end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `null` when `end` is `false`, rather than returning `end` when it is not `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end ? null : end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `null` when `end` is truthy, rather than returning `end` when it is not `true`.

DONE.
