  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimRight().startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `trimRight()` removes characters from the end of the string, while `trimLeft()` removes characters from the beginning of the string. This means that the resulting string may be different, and the `startsWith` method may return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.slice(1).startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(1)` removes the first character of the string, which may change the result of the `startsWith` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.indexOf('https') === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` returns the position of the first occurrence of the specified value in the string, while `startsWith` checks if the string starts with the specified value. This means that the resulting boolean value may be different.

DONE.
