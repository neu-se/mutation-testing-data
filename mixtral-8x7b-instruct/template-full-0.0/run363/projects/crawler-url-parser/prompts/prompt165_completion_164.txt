 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pageurl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly accesses the `path` property of the `pageurl` object, instead of using the `pageurl_path` variable that has the same value. This change might cause issues if the `pageurl` object doesn't have a `path` property or if the `path` property is accessed before it is defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pageurl_path.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(0)` creates a new array, while the original code uses the same array. This change might cause issues if the original array is modified later in the code, and the modified values are expected in other parts of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pageurl_path.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat()` creates a new array, while the original code uses the
