  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'longitudee'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `hasOwnProperty` method to return `false`, even if the `longitude` property exists, because the property name is not an exact match.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'lon'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `hasOwnProperty` method to return `false`, even if the `longitude` property exists, because the property name is not an exact match.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'latitude'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `hasOwnProperty` method to return `true`, even if the `longitude` property does not exist, because the property name is an exact match.

DONE.
