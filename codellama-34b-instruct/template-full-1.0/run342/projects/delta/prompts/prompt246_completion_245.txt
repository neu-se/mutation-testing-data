  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` and `delete` are inverse operations, so using `insert` instead of `delete` would result in the opposite change, which would likely cause incorrect behavior in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` is a different operation than `delete`, and using it instead would likely cause incorrect behavior in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.delete(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete a different number of characters than the original code, which could cause issues in the code.

DONE.
