  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex + length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the `slice` method to include one more character than it should, potentially resulting in an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex + length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the `slice` method to exclude one character that it should include, potentially resulting in an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 1, baseIndex + length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the `slice` method to start one character later than it should, potentially resulting in an incorrect result.

DONE.
