  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
games.concat(clothes)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method returns a new array, so the `games` array would be modified and would no longer contain the same elements as before.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
games.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method returns a new array with the specified elements, so the `games` array would be modified and would no longer contain the same elements as before.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
games.splice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method removes the specified elements from the array, so the `games` array would be modified and would no longer contain the same elements as before.

DONE.
