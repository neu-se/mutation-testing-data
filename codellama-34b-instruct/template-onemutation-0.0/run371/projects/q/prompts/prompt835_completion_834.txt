  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.domain && process.domain.bind(onUnhandledError)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process.domain` check is now being performed on the result of `process.domain.bind(onUnhandledError)`, which is a function, rather than on `process.domain` itself. This would cause the `onUnhandledError` function to be bound to the `process.domain` object, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
