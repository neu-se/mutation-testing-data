  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `diff()` function expects a string as input, but `1` is a number. This would cause the function to throw a `TypeError` when it tries to call the `indexOf()` method on the number `1`, which is not supported.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `diff()` function expects a string as input, but `''` is an empty string, which has no characters and cannot be compared with the `indexOf()` method. This would cause the function to throw a `RangeError` when it tries to call the `indexOf()` method on an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the `diff()` function expects a string as input, but `' '` is a string that contains a single space character. This would cause the function to treat the space character as a valid character, even though it
