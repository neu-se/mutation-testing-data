  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(promise, undefined, onRejected, onProgress);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would ignore any resolved promises and only handle rejected promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(promise, onFulfilled, onRejected, onProgress);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would handle both resolved and rejected promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).fail(onRejected).done(onProgress);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would handle only rejected promises.

DONE.
