  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.resolve` returns a resolved URL string, whereas `URL.format` returns a formatted URL string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.parse` returns a URL object, whereas `URL.format` returns a formatted URL string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve(parsedUrl, parsedBaseUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.resolve` returns a resolved URL string, whereas `URL.format` returns a formatted URL string. Additionally, `URL.resolve` takes two URL objects as arguments, whereas `URL.format` takes a single URL object.

DONE.
