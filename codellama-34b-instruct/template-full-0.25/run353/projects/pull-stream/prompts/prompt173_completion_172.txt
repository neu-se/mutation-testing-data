  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray(array)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Array.isArray` method checks if an object is an array, while the `!` operator checks if an expression is truthy or falsy. In this case, the `!` operator would always return the opposite of what `Array.isArray` returns, which could cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array.length` property returns the number of elements in an array, while the `===` operator checks for strict equality. In this case, the `array.length` property would always return a number, while the `===` operator would check if the number is equal to 0. This could cause the code to behave differently if the array is empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.includes(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior
