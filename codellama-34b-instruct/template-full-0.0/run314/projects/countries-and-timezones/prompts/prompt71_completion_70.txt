  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name.toUpperCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would change the case of the timezone name, potentially causing the `buildTimezone` function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name.split('').reverse().join(''))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split`, `reverse`, and `join` methods would change the order of the characters in the timezone name, potentially causing the `buildTimezone` function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name.replace('UTC', 'GMT'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would change the string 'UTC' to 'GMT', potentially causing the `buildTimezone` function to return a different result.

DONE.
