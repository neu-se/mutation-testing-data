  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, while `Q` is a function that returns a resolved promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` is a function that returns a resolved promise, while `Q` is a function that returns a resolved promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all` is a function that returns a promise that resolves when all of the promises in an array have resolved, while `Q` is a function that returns a resolved promise.

DONE.
