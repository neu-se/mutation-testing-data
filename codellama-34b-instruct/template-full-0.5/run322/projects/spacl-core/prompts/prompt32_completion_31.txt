  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => seg + acc, ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the separator between segments would be a space instead of a slash, which could cause the matcher to fail to recognize valid paths.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => seg + acc, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the separator between segments would be empty, which could cause the matcher to recognize invalid paths that contain consecutive slashes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => seg + acc, '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the separator between segments would be a forward slash, which is not allowed in the specification language.

DONE.
