  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `startsWith` checks if the string begins with the specified substring, while `includes` checks if the string contains the substring at any position.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.endsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `endsWith` checks if the string ends with the specified substring, while `includes` checks if the string contains the substring at any position.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` returns the position of the first occurrence of the specified substring, while `includes` checks if the string contains the substring at any position.

DONE.
