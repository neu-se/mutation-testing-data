  DONE.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
true
```

This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking for falsy values, but this replacement code would always evaluate to true, resulting in a change in the behavior of the if statement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
!false
```

This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking for falsy values, but this replacement code would always evaluate to false, resulting in a change in the behavior of the if statement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
Boolean(null)
```

This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking for falsy values, but this replacement code would result in a 'null' value, resulting in a different behavior.
