  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iteration to advance in the other delta, potentially skipping over important operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iteration to advance by a fixed amount, potentially skipping over important operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iteration to advance by a fixed amount in the other delta, potentially skipping over important operations.

DONE.
