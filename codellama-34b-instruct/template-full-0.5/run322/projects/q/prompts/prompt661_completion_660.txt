  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"put"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would be called with the "put" operation instead of "post", which could cause unintended side effects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"patch"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would be called with the "patch" operation instead of "post", which could cause unintended side effects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would be called with the "delete" operation instead of "post", which could cause unintended side effects.

DONE.
