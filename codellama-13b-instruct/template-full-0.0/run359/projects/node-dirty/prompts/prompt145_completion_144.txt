  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` event would be emitted immediately after the `cork()` method is called, rather than waiting for the `drain` event to be emitted by the write stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('drain'))
```
This would result in different behavior because an error would be emitted immediately after the `cork()` method is called, rather than waiting for the `drain` event to be emitted by the write stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('close')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` event would be emitted immediately after the `cork()` method is called, rather than waiting for the `drain` event to be emitted by the write stream.

DONE.
