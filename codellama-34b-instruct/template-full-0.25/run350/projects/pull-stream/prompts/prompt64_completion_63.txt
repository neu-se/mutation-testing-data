  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(end === true ? null : end)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is not being checked for truthiness, which could cause the `done` callback to be called with a non-null value even if the stream has ended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(end === true ? null : end, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` callback is being called with an additional `null` argument, which could cause the callback to be called with an incorrect number of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(end === true ? null : end, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` callback is being called with an additional `undefined` argument, which could cause the callback to be called with an incorrect number of arguments.

DONE.
