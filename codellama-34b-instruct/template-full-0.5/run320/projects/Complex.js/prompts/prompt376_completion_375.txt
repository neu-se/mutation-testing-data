  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cosh` function to return a different value, which would in turn affect the calculation of the `coth` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cosh` function to return a different value, which would in turn affect the calculation of the `coth` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cosh` function to return a different value, which would in turn affect the calculation of the `coth` function.

DONE.
