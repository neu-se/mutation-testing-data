  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write(JSON.stringify(this._data.get(key)), (err) => {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the actual content being written to the stream, causing the written data to be different from the expected data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write(data, (err) => {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the name of the variable being passed as the second argument to `write()`, causing the write operation to fail if the stream is not in 'drain' mode.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write(data.substring(1), (err) => {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the actual data being written to the stream, causing the written data to be different from the expected data.

DONE.
