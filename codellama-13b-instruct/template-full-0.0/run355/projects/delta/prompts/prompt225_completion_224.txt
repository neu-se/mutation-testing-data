  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[1], strings[0], cursor
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the strings in the array is reversed, which could affect the outcome of the diff algorithm.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0], strings[0], cursor
```
This would result in different behavior because the same string is being compared to itself, which could result in a different diff output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[1], strings[1], cursor
```
This would result in different behavior because the same string is being compared to itself, which could result in a different diff output.

DONE.
