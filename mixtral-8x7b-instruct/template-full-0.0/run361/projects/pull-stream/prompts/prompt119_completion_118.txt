 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the accumulator value would be overwritten with the callback function, instead of the reduced value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc += cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the accumulator value would be incremented by the callback function, instead of being updated with the reduced value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = reducer(cb, acc)
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments in the reducer function call would be reversed, causing the callback function to be used as the accumulator and the current accumulator value to be used as the data.

DONE.
