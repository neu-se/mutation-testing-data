  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the imaginary part of the complex number, which could change the result of the `isFinite` check.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the imaginary part of the complex number, which could change the result of the `isFinite` check.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would halve the imaginary part of the complex number, which could change the result of the `isFinite` check.

DONE.
