  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns the values of the object's own properties, while `Object.keys` returns the object's own enumerable properties. In the original code, `Object.keys(array)` is being used to iterate over the keys of the `array` object, but with `Object.values`, it would be iterating over the values instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries` returns the key-value pairs of the object's own properties, while `Object.keys` returns the object's own enumerable properties. In the original code, `Object.keys(array)` is being used to iterate over the keys of the `array` object, but with `Object.entries`, it would be iterating over the key-value pairs instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.getOwnPropertyNames
