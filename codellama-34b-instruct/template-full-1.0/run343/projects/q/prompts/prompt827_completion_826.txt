  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (false) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false`, even when the promise is rejected. As a result, the `onerror` callback would never be triggered.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (null) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `null`, even when the promise is resolved. As a result, the `onerror` callback would never be triggered.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (undefined) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `undefined`, even when the promise is rejected. As a result, the `onerror` callback would never be triggered.

DONE.
