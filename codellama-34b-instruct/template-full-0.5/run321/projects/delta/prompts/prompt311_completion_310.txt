  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` variable would be incremented by 1, whereas in the original code it is not modified.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
j
```
This would result in different behavior because the `j` variable is not defined in the original code, so it would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `0` value would be returned as the result of the `eachLine` method, whereas in the original code the result is not explicitly returned.

DONE.
