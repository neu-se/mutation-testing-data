  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.substring
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring` and `slice` have different behavior when the start index is negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.substr
```
This would result in different behavior because `substr` and `slice` have different behavior when the length argument is negative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.split
```
This would result in different behavior because `split` and `slice` have different behavior when the separator argument is a regular expression.

DONE.
