  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.slice(1)` returns a new string that is a substring of the original `path`, starting from the second character. In contrast, `path` returns the full string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.toLowerCase()` returns a new string that is all lowercase, while `path` returns the original string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split()
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.split()` returns an array of substrings, while `path` returns the full string.

DONE.
