 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript

```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns the country's ID instead of the actual country object. This change would bypass the memoization logic and always create a new country object, even if it already exists in the `countries` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data.countries[id]

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data.countries[Math.floor(Math.random() * Object.keys(data.countries).length)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a random country instead of the intended country with the given `
