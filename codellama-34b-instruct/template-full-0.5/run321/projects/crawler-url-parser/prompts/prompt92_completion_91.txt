  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `href.length` would return the length of the `href` string, which would be different from the original code fragment `href`, which would return the `href` attribute of the current element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href').length
```
This would result in different behavior because `$(this).attr('href').length` would return the length of the `href` attribute of the current element, which would be different from the original code fragment `href`, which would return the `href` attribute of the current element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.indexOf('http')
```
This would result in different behavior because `href.indexOf('http')` would return the index of the first occurrence of the string 'http' in the `href` string, which would be different from the original code fragment `href`, which would return the `href` attribute of the current element.
