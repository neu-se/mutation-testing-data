  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var ends = Q.defer(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `undefined` as the default value for the `ends` variable, while the new code fragment uses `null`. This could potentially cause issues with the `Q.defer()` function, which may not handle a `null` value correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var ends = Q.defer(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `undefined` as the default value for the `ends` variable, while the new code fragment uses the number `1`. This could potentially cause issues with the `Q.defer()` function, which may not handle a number value correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var ends = Q.defer(function() {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `undefined` as the default value for the `ends` variable, while the
