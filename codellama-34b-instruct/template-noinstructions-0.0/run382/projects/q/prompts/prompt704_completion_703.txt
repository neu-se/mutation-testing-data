  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `fbind` method to always return a function with no arguments, regardless of the arguments passed to the original function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `fbind` method to always return a function with one fewer argument than the original function, regardless of the arguments passed to the original function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `fbind` method to always return a function with two fewer arguments than the original function, regardless of the arguments passed to the original function.

DONE.
