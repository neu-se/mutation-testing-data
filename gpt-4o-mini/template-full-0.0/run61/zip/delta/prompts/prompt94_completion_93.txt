Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp = { insert: 'default' };
```
This would result in different behavior because it initializes `newOp` with a default string value instead of the intended operation, which could lead to incorrect operations being pushed into the `ops` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets `newOp` to `null`, which would cause the `push` method to attempt to push a null value into the `ops` array, potentially leading to runtime errors or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp = { delete: 1 };
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the operation being pushed to a delete operation with a length of 1, which could alter the intended sequence of operations and affect the overall state of the `ops` array.

DONE.
