  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(this.index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the `ops` array starting from the next index instead of the current index. This could cause the `Iterator` to skip over some operations in the `ops` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(this.index - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the `ops` array starting from the previous index instead of the current index. This could cause the `Iterator` to return operations that are not part of the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(this.index + 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the `ops` array starting from the next index + 2 instead of the current index. This could cause the `Iterator` to skip over some operations in the `
