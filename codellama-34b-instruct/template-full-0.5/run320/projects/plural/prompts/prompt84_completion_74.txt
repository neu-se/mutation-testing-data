  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mouse'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `'mice'`, which is the correct plural form of the word "mouse". Replacing it with `'mouse'` would result in the incorrect plural form of the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mouses'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `'mice'`, which is the correct plural form of the word "mouse". Replacing it with `'mouses'` would result in an incorrect plural form of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mous'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `'mice'`, which is the correct plural form of the word "mouse". Replacing it with `'mous'` would result in an incorrect plural form of the word.

DONE.
