  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, args])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `post` method to be called twice, which could lead to unexpected side effects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("apply", [name, args])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `apply` method to be called instead of the `post` method, which could lead to different behavior depending on the implementation of the `apply` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("call", [name, args])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `call` method to be called instead of the `post` method, which could lead to different behavior depending on the implementation of the `call` method.

DONE.
