  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
      var tempstring
```
This would result in different behavior because tempstring is not a valid regex pattern. The original code fragment was a regex pattern representing games.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
       var plier
```
This would result in different behavior because plier is not a valid regex pattern. The original code fragment was a regex pattern representing games.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
      var times
```
This would result in different behavior because times does not match any of the games in the games array. The original code fragment was a regex pattern representing games.

DONE.
