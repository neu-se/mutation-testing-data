  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id], options
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options` object is not being passed to the `getCountry` function, which could cause issues if the function relies on the `options` object for its behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id], {...options, deprecated: true}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deprecated` property of the `options` object is being set to `true`, which could cause the `getCountry` function to return a different result than it would with the original `options` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id], {...options, deprecated: false}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deprecated` property of the `options` object is being set to `false`, which could cause the `getCountry` function to return a different result than it would with the original `options` object.
