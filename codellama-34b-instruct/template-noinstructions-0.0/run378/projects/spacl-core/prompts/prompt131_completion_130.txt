  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop === undefined || match[index + 1] === prop
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the property is undefined or if the property is not equal to the match at the current index, while this new code fragment checks if the property is undefined or if the property is equal to the match at the current index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop !== undefined && match[index + 1] !== prop
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the property is undefined or if the property is not equal to the match at the current index, while this new code fragment checks if the property is not undefined and if the property is not equal to the match at the current index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop === undefined || match[index + 1] !== prop
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the property is undefined or if the property is not equal to the match
