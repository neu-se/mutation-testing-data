  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` method returns `true` if the value is `NaN`, while the original code fragment returns `true` if the value is not `NaN`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite` method returns `true` if the value is a finite number, while the original code fragment returns `true` if the value is not `NaN`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method returns `true` if the value is `Infinity`, while the original code fragment returns `true` if the value is not `NaN`.

DONE.
