  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"test.txt"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `targetFilePath` variable, which is a string that represents the path to the target file. Replacing it with a hardcoded string "test.txt" would cause the code to always use the same file, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath + ".txt"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `targetFilePath` variable, which is a string that represents the path to the target file. Appending ".txt" to the end of the string would cause the code to always use a file with the same name, but in a different directory.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.join(targetFilePath, "test.txt")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `targetFilePath` variable, which is a string that represents the path to the target file.
