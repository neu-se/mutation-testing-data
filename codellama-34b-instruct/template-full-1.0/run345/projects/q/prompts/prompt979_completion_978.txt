  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of the `nodeArgs` array, resulting in a different function call.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes the last element of the `nodeArgs` array, resulting in a different function call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs = []
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array is being reset to an empty array, resulting in a different function call.

DONE.
