  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `object` as the first argument to `object_hasOwnProperty`, which would always return `true`, causing the `if` statement to always be executed, even if the `key` is not in the `object`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `key` as the first argument to `object_hasOwnProperty`, which would always return `false`, causing the `if` statement to never be executed, even if the `key` is in the `object`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the value of the `key` in the `object` as the first argument to `object_hasOwnProperty`, which would return `true` if the `key` is in the `object`, and `false` otherwise. This would cause
