  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would continue indefinitely, causing a stack overflow error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only execute twice, rather than for the full length of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute in reverse order, potentially returning incorrect results.

DONE.
