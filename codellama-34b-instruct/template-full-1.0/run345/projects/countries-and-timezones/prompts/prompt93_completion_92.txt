  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function `getTimezonesForCountry()` to return `null` instead of an object, as it would be trying to read the `timezones` property of `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function `getTimezonesForCountry()` to return an empty object instead of an object with information about the timezones of a country.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(1,2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function `getTimezonesForCountry()` to return an object with two properties, `0` and `1`, instead of an object with a single property containing the timezones of a country.

DONE.
