  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `reverse()` is a method that reverses the order of the items in an array, but in this case, the exception being checked is not an array, so it would result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `length` is a property that returns the length of an array, but in this case, the exception being checked is not an array, so it would result in `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception instanceof Error
```
This would result in different behavior because `instanceof` checks if an object is an instance of a particular class, but in this case, the exception being checked is not an instance of `Error`, so it would result in `false`.

DONE.
