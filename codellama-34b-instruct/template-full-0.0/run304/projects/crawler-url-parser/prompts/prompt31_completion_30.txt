  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a regular expression that matches the start of a string if it does not contain a protocol (e.g. "http://" or "https://"), while the new code fragment is a regular expression that matches the start of a string if it does not contain a protocol and does not start with a word character followed by a colon (e.g. "://").
