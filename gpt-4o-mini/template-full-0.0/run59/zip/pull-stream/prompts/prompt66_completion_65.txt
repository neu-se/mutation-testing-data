Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === false ? null : end
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check for `false` instead of `true`, which means that if `end` is `false`, it will return `null`, while the original code would return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === undefined ? null : end
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `end` is `undefined` instead of `true`, which means that if `end` is `undefined`, it will return `null`, while the original code would return `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === null ? end : true
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns `end` if it is `null`, otherwise it returns `true`, which is a different logic than the original code that returns `null` or `end` based on whether `end` is `true`.

DONE.
