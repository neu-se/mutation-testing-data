  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `messages.length` would always be truthy, even if the promise has been resolved, whereas `messages` would be falsy if the promise has been resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `messages[0]` would always be the first element of the `messages` array, even if the promise has been resolved, whereas `messages` would be undefined if the promise has been resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `messages.pop()` would always return the last element of the `messages` array, even if the promise has been resolved, whereas `messages` would be undefined if the promise has been resolved.

DONE.
