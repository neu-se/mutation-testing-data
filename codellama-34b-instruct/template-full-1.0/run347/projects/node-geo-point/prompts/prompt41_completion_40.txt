  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because it would switch the latitude values used in the calculation, which could result in a different point being calculated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(point1Rad + point2Rad) / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the average of the two latitude values instead of the exact values, which could result in a different point being calculated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(point1Rad, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would square the first latitude value instead of using it directly, which could result in a different point being calculated.

DONE.
