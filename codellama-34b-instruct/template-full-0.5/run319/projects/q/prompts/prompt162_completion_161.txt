  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackString.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using the `split` method with a regular expression, while this replacement is using the `split` method with a string as the separator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackString.split(/\s+/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using the `split` method with a regular expression, while this replacement is using the `split` method with a different regular expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackString.split(/\s+/g)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using the `split` method with a regular expression, while this replacement is using the `split` method with a different regular expression and the `g` flag to match all occurrences.

DONE.
