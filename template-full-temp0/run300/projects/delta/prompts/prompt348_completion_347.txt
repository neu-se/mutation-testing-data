  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData, baseOpData
```
This would result in different behavior because the `opData` and `baseOpData` variables are not defined in the current scope.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData, otherOpData
```
This would result in different behavior because the `otherOpData` variable is not defined in the current scope.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData, thisOpData
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thisOpData` variable is not defined in the current scope.

DONE.
