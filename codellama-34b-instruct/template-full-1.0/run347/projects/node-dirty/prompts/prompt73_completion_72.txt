  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code === 'ENOEXIST'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the error to be treated as a file that does not exist, rather than a file that cannot be found.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code == 'EACCESS'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the error to be treated as a permission error, rather than a file not found error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code === 'ENOTDIR'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the error to be treated as a not a directory error, rather than a file not found error.

DONE.
