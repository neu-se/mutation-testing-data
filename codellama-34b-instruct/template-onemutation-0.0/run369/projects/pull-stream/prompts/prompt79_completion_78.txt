  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `next()`, which would call the `next` function with no arguments. However, `next(null)` would call the `next` function with a `null` argument, which could potentially cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
