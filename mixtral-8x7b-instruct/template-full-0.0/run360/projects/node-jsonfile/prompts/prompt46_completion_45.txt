 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fs.writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `_fs` variable instead of the `fs` parameter, which could cause issues if the application relies on the `fs` parameter being used in the scope of the `writeFileSync` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.write
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.write` is not the same as `fs.writeFileSync`. `fs.write` writes data to a file without closing it, while `fs.writeFileSync` writes data to a file and then closes it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes an empty string as the first argument, which would cause the function to write to a file named "" (empty string) instead of the intended file.

DONE.
