  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.lastIndexOf("[object Promise]")
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastIndexOf` returns the index of the last occurrence of the specified value in the string, while `indexOf` returns the index of the first occurrence. If the string contains multiple occurrences of the specified value, `lastIndexOf` would return a different result than `indexOf`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.substring(e.stack.indexOf("[object Promise]") + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring` returns a portion of the string starting from the specified index, while `indexOf` returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified value. If the string contains multiple occurrences of the specified value, `substring` would return a different result than `indexOf`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.split("[object Promise]")[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because
