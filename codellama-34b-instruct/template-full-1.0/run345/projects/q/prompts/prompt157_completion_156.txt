  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_setProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a different function for setting properties on objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_setProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a different function for setting properties on arrays.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise_setProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a different function for setting properties on promises.

DONE.
