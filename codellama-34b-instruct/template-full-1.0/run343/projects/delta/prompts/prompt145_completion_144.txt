  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of the `ops` array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end. This would cause the `ops` array to be constructed in a different order, which could potentially result in a different final state of the `Delta` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `reverse` reverses the order of the elements in the `ops` array. This would cause the `ops` array to be constructed in a different order, which could potentially result in a different final state of the `Delta` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const ops = [];
ops.push(...this.ops);
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new `ops` array and pushes all the elements of `this.ops` into it. This would cause the `ops`
