  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev | {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return an empty object instead of the expected type of the properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev & {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a copy of the `prev` object instead of the expected type of the properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!prev
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the negation of the `prev` object instead of the expected type of the properties.

DONE.
