```
This would result in different behavior because it would match a different set of strings, potentially causing the code to fail or produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
\d+\.?\d*e[+-]?\d+|\d+\.?\d*|\.\d+|./g
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match a different set of strings, potentially causing the code to fail or produce incorrect results.
