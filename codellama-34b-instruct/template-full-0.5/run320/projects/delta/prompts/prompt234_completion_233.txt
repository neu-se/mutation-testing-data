  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` and `push` are different methods of the `Delta` class, and they have different effects on the delta's internal state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.retain(length, { retain: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` and `push` have different effects on the delta's internal state, and the `retain` method can take an optional `attributes` argument that can be used to modify the attributes of the retained text.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.delete(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` and `push` have different effects on the delta's internal state, and the `delete` method can take a `length` argument that specifies the number of characters to delete.

DONE.
