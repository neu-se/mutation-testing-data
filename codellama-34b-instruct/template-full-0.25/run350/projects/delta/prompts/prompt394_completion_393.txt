  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of an object is always a positive integer, while `0` is a falsy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of an object is always a positive integer, while `-1` is a negative integer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of an object is always a positive integer, while `null` is a null value.

DONE.
