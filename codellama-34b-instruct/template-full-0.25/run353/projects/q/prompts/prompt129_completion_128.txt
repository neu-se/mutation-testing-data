  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keys.push(index)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the index of the current element in the loop to the `keys` array, rather than the element itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keys.push(this[index])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the element at the current index in the loop to the `keys` array, rather than the index itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keys.push(this[index++])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the element at the current index in the loop to the `keys` array, and then increment the index by 1.

DONE.
