  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y
```
This would result in different behavior because `y` is a different variable than `x`, and it may not have the same value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * y
```
This would result in different behavior because `x * y` is a different expression than `x`, and it may not have the same value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + y
```
This would result in different behavior because `x + y` is a different expression than `x`, and it may not have the same value.

DONE.
