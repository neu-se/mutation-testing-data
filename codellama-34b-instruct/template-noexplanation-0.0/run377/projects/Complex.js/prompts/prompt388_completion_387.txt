  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a + 1
```
This change will cause the `cosh` function to return a different value than it would with the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a - 1
```
This change will also cause the `cosh` function to return a different value than it would with the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a * b
```
This change will cause the `cosh` function to return a different value than it would with the original code fragment, and it will also cause the `coth` function to return a different value than it would with the original code fragment.

DONE.
