  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the `NULL_CHARACTER` constant is no longer used, and the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function would throw an error when called with a `null` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\u200b'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `NULL_CHARACTER` constant is no longer used, and the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function would throw an error when called with an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.fromCharCode(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `NULL_CHARACTER` constant is no longer used, and the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function would throw an error when called with a string with length 1.

DONE.
