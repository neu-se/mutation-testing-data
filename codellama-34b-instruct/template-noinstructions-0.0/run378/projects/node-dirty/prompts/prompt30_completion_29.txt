  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value associated with the key, rather than the key itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key).toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the string representation of the value associated with the key, rather than the key itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key).toJSON()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the JSON representation of the value associated with the key, rather than the key itself.

DONE.
