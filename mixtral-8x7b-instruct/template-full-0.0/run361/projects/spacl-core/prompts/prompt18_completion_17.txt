 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'spec'.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first character ('s') from the specification string, causing the regex to not match the original path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'spec'.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the specification string to uppercase, causing the regex to not match paths with lowercase characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'./' + spec
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prepend './' to the specification string, causing the regex to not match paths that don't start with './'.

DONE.
