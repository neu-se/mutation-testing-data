  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `String.fromCharCode()` method expects a Unicode code point as its argument, and `1` is not a valid code point. The original code fragment used `0`, which is a valid code point for the null character.

DONE.
