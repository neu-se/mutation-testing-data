  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it omits the first argument of the `arguments` object. This could cause the function to behave differently than expected, especially if the first argument is important for the function's behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it only includes the first argument of the `arguments` object. This could cause the function to behave differently than expected, especially if the first argument is important for the function's behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it skips the first two arguments of the `arguments` object. This could cause the function to behave differently than expected, especially if the first two arguments are important for the function's behavior.

DONE.
