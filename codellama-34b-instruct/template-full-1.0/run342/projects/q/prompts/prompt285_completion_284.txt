  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `value + 1`. This would result in different behavior because the code fragment would always return `value + 1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `value - 1`. This would result in different behavior because the code fragment would always return `value - 1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `value++`. This would result in different behavior because the code fragment would always return `value + 1`.

DONE.
