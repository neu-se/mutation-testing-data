  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delete newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` operator would remove the `newOp` object from the array, rather than adding it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` property of `newOp` would be set to the string `'foo'`, rather than the value of the `arg` parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property of `newOp` would be set to `0`, rather than the value of the `length` parameter.

DONE.
