  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `b`, which is a variable, and `-b` would negate its value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `b`, which is a variable, and `b + 1` would add 1 to its value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `b`, which is a variable, and `b * 2` would multiply its value by 2.

DONE.
