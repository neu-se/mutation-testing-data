  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w !== 'dwarf' && w !== 'roof'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the word is equal to 'dwarf' or 'roof', while this new code fragment checks if the word is not equal to 'dwarf' and not equal to 'roof'. This would cause the test to fail if the word is 'dwarf' or 'roof', even though it should pass.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w === 'dwarf' || w === 'roof' || w === 'dwarves'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if the word is equal to 'dwarf' or 'roof', while this new code fragment also checks if the word is equal to 'dwarves'. This would cause the test to pass if the word is 'dwarves', even though it should fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
