  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Q can't apply finally callback");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment did not throw an error, but the new code fragment would throw an error if the callback is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return callback.fcall().then(function () {
    return value;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned a promise that resolved to the value, but the new code fragment would return a promise that resolved to the result of the callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return callback.fcall().then(function () {
    throw reason;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned a promise that resolved to the value, but the new code fragment would return a promise that rejected with the reason.

DONE.
