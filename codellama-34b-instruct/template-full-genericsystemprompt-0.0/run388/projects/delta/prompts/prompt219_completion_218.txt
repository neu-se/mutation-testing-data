  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops !== other.ops
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the comparison, causing the `diff` method to return a non-empty delta even if the two deltas are equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length !== other.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the length of the two deltas, rather than the contents.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return an empty delta, regardless of the contents of the two deltas.

DONE.
