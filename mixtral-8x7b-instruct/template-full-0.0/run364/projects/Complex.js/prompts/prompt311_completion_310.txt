 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the result of `Math.cos`, which can lead to incorrect values for the `sec` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` and `Math.cos` have different ranges, which can lead to incorrect values for the `sec` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(Math.cos)
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns positive values, which can lead to incorrect values for the `sec` function when negative values are expected.

DONE.
