  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `this` refers to the current instance of the `GeoPoint` class, while `null` is a null reference.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `this` refers to the current instance of the `GeoPoint` class, while `undefined` is a primitive value that represents the absence of any defined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `this` refers to the current instance of the `GeoPoint` class, while `{}` is an empty object literal that does not have any properties or methods.

DONE.
