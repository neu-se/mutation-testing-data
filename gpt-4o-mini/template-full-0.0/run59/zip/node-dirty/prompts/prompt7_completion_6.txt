Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'key'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would store the value under the string literal 'key' instead of the actual variable `key`, leading to all values being overwritten under the same key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to store the value under `null`, which is not a valid key in the Map, effectively preventing any data from being stored.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + '1'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append '1' to the key, causing the data to be stored under a modified key instead of the original key, potentially leading to data loss or unexpected behavior when retrieving values.

DONE.
