  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the while loop to continue when there is still an operation in the other iterator, potentially resulting in a mismatch between the two iterators.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the while loop to continue when the next operation in the other iterator is a retain operation, potentially resulting in a mismatch between the two iterators.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the while loop to continue when the next operation in the other iterator has a length of 0, potentially resulting in a mismatch between the two iterators.

DONE.
