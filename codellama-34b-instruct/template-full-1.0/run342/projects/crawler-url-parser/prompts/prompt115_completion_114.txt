  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because `urlMap.keys()` and `urlMap.values()` return different values, with `keys()` returning an iterator for the keys of the map and `values()` returning an iterator for the values of the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.entries()
```
This would result in different behavior because `urlMap.entries()` and `urlMap.values()` return different values, with `entries()` returning an iterator for the [key, value] pairs of the map and `values()` returning an iterator for the values of the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (let currentUrl of urlMap.values()) {
    console.log(currentUrl);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would log the values of the map to the console, while the original code would not.

DONE.
