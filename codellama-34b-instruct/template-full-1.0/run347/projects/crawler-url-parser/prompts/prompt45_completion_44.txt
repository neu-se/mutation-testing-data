  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

baseUrlStr, false, true
```
This would result in a different result because the base URL would be parsed with the `false` parameter, which means that the protocol will not be part of the parsed URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

baseUrlStr, true, false
```
This would result in a different result because the base URL would be parsed with the `true` parameter, which means that the protocol will be part of the parsed URL, but the `false` parameter would mean that the host will not be included in the parsed URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in a different result because the base URL would be parsed with the `true` parameter, which means that the protocol will be part of the parsed URL, but the `false` parameter would mean that the host will not be included in the parsed URL.

DONE.
