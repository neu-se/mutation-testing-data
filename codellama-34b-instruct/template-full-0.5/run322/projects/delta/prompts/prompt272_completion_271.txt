  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength()` returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, while `hasNext()` returns a boolean indicating whether there is a next operation or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the other iterator has a next operation, while the original code checks if the current iterator has a next operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, while the original code checks if there is a next operation in the iterator.

DONE.
