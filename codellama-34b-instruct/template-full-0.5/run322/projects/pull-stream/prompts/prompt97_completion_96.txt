  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended
```
This would result in different behavior because `!ended` is always `true` when `ended` is `false`, and `false` when `ended` is `true`. In the original code, `ended` is only set to `true` when the callback is called, so the `if` statement would always evaluate to `false` when `ended` is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended === true
```
This would result in different behavior because `ended === true` is only `true` when `ended` is `true`, whereas the original code would evaluate to `true` when `ended` is `false` if the callback has not been called yet.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because `ended !== true` is only `true` when `ended` is `false`, whereas the original code would evaluate to `true` when `ended` is `true` if
