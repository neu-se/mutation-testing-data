  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cursor + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the cursor by 1, potentially causing the diff algorithm to skip over a character in the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cursor - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the cursor by 1, potentially causing the diff algorithm to go back and re-examine a character that it had already processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cursor + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the cursor by 2, potentially causing the diff algorithm to skip over two characters in the string.

DONE.
