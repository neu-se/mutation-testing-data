  Thank you! I'll start looking at options for you.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because multiplication by 2 would significantly alter the result of the algorithm, which relies on the atan2 function to determine the angle of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + c
```
This would result in different behavior because addition of the angle components would significantly alter the result of the algorithm, which relies on the atan2 function to determine the angle of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b / Math.sqrt(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because dividing by the square root of 2 would significantly alter the magnitude of the result, which is expected to be a positive real value for sin(b) and cos(b).

DONE.
