  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.delete + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` property is incremented by 1, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if the `delete` property is not greater than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.delete - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` property is decremented by 1, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if the `delete` property is greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.delete * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` property is multiplied by 2, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if the `delete` property is not greater than 0.

DONE.
