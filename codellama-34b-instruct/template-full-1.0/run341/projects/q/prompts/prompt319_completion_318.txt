  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return reject(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to reject with no reason, rather than using the original reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { throw new Error("Something went wrong"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to reject with a new error, rather than using the original reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return fulfilled(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to fulfill with no value, rather than using the original value.

DONE.
