  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:tea|sugar|water|air|rice|knowledge|beauty|anger|fear|love|money|research|safety|evidence)\b/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag is added to the regular expression, which makes it match all occurrences in the string, not just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:tea|sugar|water|air|rice|knowledge|beauty|anger|fear|love|money|research|safety|evidence)\b/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag is added to the regular expression, which makes it case-insensitive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:tea|sugar|water|air|rice|knowledge|beauty|anger
