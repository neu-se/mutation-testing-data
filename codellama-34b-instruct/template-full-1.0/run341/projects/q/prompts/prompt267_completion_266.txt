  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(fulfill(reason));
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill` is a method that creates a new promise that is resolved with the given value, whereas `reject` is a method that rejects the promise with the given reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(reject(reason));
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill` is a method that resolves the promise, whereas `reject` is a method that rejects the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(new Error(reason));
```
This would result in different behavior because `new Error(reason)` is an expression that creates a new `Error` object, whereas `reject(reason)` is a method that rejects the promise with the given reason.

DONE.
