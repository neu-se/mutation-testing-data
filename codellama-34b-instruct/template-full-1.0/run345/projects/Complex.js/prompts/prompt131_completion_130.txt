  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be negating the `isInfinite` property, which means that the code would only execute if the number is not infinite, rather than if it is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'] && z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be checking if both `this` and `z` are infinite, rather than just `this`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be checking if `this` is real (i.e., its imaginary part is 0), rather than checking if it is infinite.

DONE.
