  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error, causing the promise to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (value instanceof Promise) {
  return value.then(<original implementation>);
} else {
  return <original implementation>(value);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the value is a promise and if so, return the result of the promise instead of the original implementation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<original implementation>().then(function(value) {
  if (value instanceof Promise) {
    return value.then(<original implementation>);
  } else {
    return <original implementation>(value);
  }
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would apply the original implementation to the result of the promise instead of the promise itself.

DONE.
