  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!_read
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the truthiness of `_read`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `_read` is falsy, and `false` when it is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, so the `if` statement would only evaluate to `true` when `_read` is strictly equal to `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, so the `if` statement would only evaluate to `true` when `_read` is strictly not equal to `null`.

DONE.
