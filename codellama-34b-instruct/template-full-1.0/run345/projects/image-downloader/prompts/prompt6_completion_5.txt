  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new TypeError('The options.dest is not a string')
```
This would result in different behavior because a TypeError is thrown instead of an Error. The error message is also different, which could potentially cause problems if the code is not handling the error correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The options.dest is required')
```
This would result in the same behavior as the original code, because it throws an Error with the same message. This test case is not useful for mutation testing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The options.dest is required')
```
This would result in different behavior because it throws an Error with a different message. This test case is not useful for mutation testing.

DONE.
