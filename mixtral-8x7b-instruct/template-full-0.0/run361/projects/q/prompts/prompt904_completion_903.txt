 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.fapply(nodeArgs).fail(function() { deferred.reject(new Error("Failed")); });
```
This would result in different behavior because the error handling is now more specific, rejecting with a new Error object instead of propagating the original error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.fapply(nodeArgs).then(null, deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.fail()` method has been changed to `.then(null, deferred.reject)`, which might have different error handling semantics in certain versions of the Q library.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.fapply(nodeArgs).catch(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the ES6 `.catch()` method is used instead of the Q-specific `.fail()` method, which might not behave exactly the same way in all
