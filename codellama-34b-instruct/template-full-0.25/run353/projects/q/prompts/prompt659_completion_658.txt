  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a different array, with the first element of `arguments` being excluded.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a different array, with the first three elements of `arguments` being excluded.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a different array, with all elements of `arguments` being included.

DONE.
