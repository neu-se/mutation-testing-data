  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.reviver = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` function is used to transform the data after it has been parsed, and setting it to `null` would cause the data to be returned as-is, without any transformation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.reviver = function(key, value) { return value; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` function is used to transform the data after it has been parsed, and setting it to a function that simply returns the value would cause the data to be returned unchanged, without any transformation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.reviver = function(key, value) { return value + 1; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` function is used to transform the data after it has been parsed, and setting it to a function that adds 1 to the value
