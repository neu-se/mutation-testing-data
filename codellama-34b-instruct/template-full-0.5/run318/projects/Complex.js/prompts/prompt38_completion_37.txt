  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a < 3000 && _b > 3000
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if both `_a` and `_b` are less than 3000, while this replacement checks if `_a` is less than 3000 and `_b` is greater than 3000. This would cause the function to return a different result for certain inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a > 3000 && _b < 3000
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if both `_a` and `_b` are less than 3000, while this replacement checks if `_a` is greater than 3000 and `_b` is less than 3000. This would cause the function to return a different result for certain inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a < 3
