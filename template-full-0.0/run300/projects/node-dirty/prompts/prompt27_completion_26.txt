  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', 'foo');
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is now `'drain'` instead of `'foo'`, which could cause the event listener to not be triggered.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', this._data.size);
```
This would result in different behavior because the event data is now the size of the `_data` map instead of the original value, which could cause the event listener to not be triggered.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', this._data.size + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the event data is now the size of the `_data` map plus one instead of the original value, which could cause the event listener to not be triggered.

DONE.
