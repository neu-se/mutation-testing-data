 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._data.clear()
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes all key-value pairs from the `_data` map, whereas the original code only removes the key-value pair associated with the given key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._data.has(key) && this._data.delete(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the key exists before attempting to delete it, whereas the original code does not perform this check.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._data['key'] = undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the value associated with the string 'key' to undefined, rather than removing the key-value pair associated with the given key.

DONE.
