  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(thisIter.offset)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the `ops` array starting from the current offset of the `thisIter` iterator, rather than the `rest` of the `ops` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(otherIter.offset)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the `ops` array of the `other` delta starting from the current offset of the `otherIter` iterator, rather than the `rest` of the `ops` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(thisIter.offset).concat(other.ops.slice(otherIter.offset))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `ops` array of the `this` delta starting from the current offset of the `thisIter` iterator with the `ops` array of the
