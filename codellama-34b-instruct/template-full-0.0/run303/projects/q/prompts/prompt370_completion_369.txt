  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `_rejected` is a function that handles the rejection of a promise, whereas `_progressed` is a function that handles the progress of a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `_fulfilled` is a function that handles the fulfillment of a promise, whereas `_progressed` is a function that handles the progress of a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_progressed(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `_progressed` is a function that handles the progress of a promise, whereas `_progressed(value)` is a function call that passes the `value` argument to the `_progressed` function.

DONE.
