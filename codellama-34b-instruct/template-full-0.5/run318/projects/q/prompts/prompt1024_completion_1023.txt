  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!nodeback
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the truthiness of the `nodeback` function, causing the `if (nodeback)` check to fail, even if `nodeback` is a valid function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator performs addition, and `nodeback` is a function, so this expression would result in a `TypeError` if `nodeback` is not a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method is used to invoke a function with a specific `this` value, and `nodeback.call(null)` would invoke the `nodeback` function with `this` set to `null`, even if `nodeback` is a method of an object.

DONE.
