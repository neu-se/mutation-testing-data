  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/,'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the protocol of the URL from "http" to "https".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/,'ftp://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the protocol of the URL from "http" to "ftp".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/,'file://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the protocol of the URL from "http" to "file".

DONE.
