  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the `deprecated` property of the `options` object, regardless of whether it is defined or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an empty object if the `deprecated` property is not defined, rather than returning `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated ? options.deprecated : {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an empty object if the `deprecated` property is not defined, rather than returning `undefined`.

DONE.
