  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr + "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would concatenate the string "foo" to the end of `baseUrlStr`, which would cause the `parse` function to return a different URL object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring` method would return a substring of `baseUrlStr` starting from the second character, which would cause the `parse` function to return a different URL object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.split("/")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method would split the string `baseUrlStr` into an array of substrings using "/" as the delimiter, and then return the first element of the array, which would cause the `parse` function to return a different URL object.

DONE.
