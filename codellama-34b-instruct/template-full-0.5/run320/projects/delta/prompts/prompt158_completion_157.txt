  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength()` returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, while `peekType()` returns the type of the next operation. In the context of the `diff()` function, the `peekType()` call is used to determine the type of the next operation in the `otherIter` iterator, which is then used to determine how to handle the operation. Replacing `peekType()` with `peekLength()` would cause the function to misinterpret the type of the next operation and potentially produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength()` returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, while `peekType()` returns the type of the next operation. In the context of the `diff()` function, the `peekType()` call is used to determine the type of the next operation in the `thisIter` iterator, which
