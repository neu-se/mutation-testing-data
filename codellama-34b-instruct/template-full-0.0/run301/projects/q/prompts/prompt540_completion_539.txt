  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments, while `apply` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and an array of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` is a method that creates a new function that, when called, will call the original function with a given `this` value and arguments, while `apply` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and an array of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled.apply(null, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `fulfilled` function with a `null` `this` value and an array of arguments, while the original code calls the `fulfilled` function with the `this` value of the `sp
