  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.filter(op => op.retain == null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment retains all elements in the `ops` array, while the modified code fragment only retains elements where `op.retain` is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.filter(op => op.retain != null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment retains all elements in the `ops` array, while the modified code fragment only retains elements where `op.retain` is not null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.filter(op => op.retain == 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment retains all elements in the `ops` array, while the modified code fragment only retains elements where `op.retain` is equal to 0.

DONE.
