  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, [data])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `cb` function with a single argument, while this new fragment calls it with an array containing the `data` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, {data})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `cb` function with a single argument, while this new fragment calls it with an object containing the `data` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `cb` function with a single argument, while this new fragment calls it with the value of `this` in the current execution context.

DONE.
