  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject, op, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `deferred.resolve` would cause it to be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve, "foo", args
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` argument would be different, and the `args` argument would be passed as the second argument to `deferred.resolve`, whereas in the original code it is passed as the third argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve, op, []
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` argument would be an empty array, whereas in the original code it is the `args` argument passed to `dispatch`.

DONE.
