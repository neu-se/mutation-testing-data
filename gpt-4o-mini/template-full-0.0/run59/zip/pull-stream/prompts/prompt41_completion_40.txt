Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` removes the last element from the array `ref`, which changes the arguments passed to the `pull` function, potentially leading to unexpected results or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull.call(null, ref)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call()` invokes the function with a specified `this` value and arguments, which is different from `apply()` that expects an array of arguments. This could lead to incorrect handling of the `ref` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift()` removes the first element from the array `ref`, which alters the arguments passed to the `pull` function, potentially causing it to behave incorrectly or produce unexpected results.

DONE.
