  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.createWriteStream(targetFilePath, { flags: 'a' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flags` option is set to `'a'`, which means that the file will be appended to instead of overwritten. This could cause the archive to be corrupted or incomplete.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.createWriteStream(targetFilePath, { encoding: 'base64' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `encoding` option is set to `'base64'`, which means that the file will be written in base64 encoding instead of the default encoding. This could cause the archive to be corrupted or incomplete.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.createWriteStream(targetFilePath, { fd: 0 });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fd` option is set to `0`, which means that the file will be written to the standard input instead
