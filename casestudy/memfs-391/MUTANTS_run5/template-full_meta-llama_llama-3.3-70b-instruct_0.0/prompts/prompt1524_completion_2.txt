Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'w'
```
This would result in different behavior because the file would be opened in write mode instead of read mode, potentially causing issues if the file does not exist or if the write operation fails.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'wx'
```
This would result in different behavior because the file would be opened in exclusive write mode, which would throw an error if the file already exists, whereas the original code would not have this restriction.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'a+'
```
This would result in different behavior because the file would be opened in append mode, allowing both reading and writing, whereas the original code only allows reading, potentially causing issues if the file is not intended to be modified.

DONE.
