  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned both `null` and `data`, while `null` is being returned alone, which would indicate that the stream has ended and no further data is available.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned both `null` and `data`, while `undefined` is being returned alone, which would indicate that the stream has not ended yet and data is still available.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned both `null` and `data`, while `true` is being returned alone, which would indicate that the stream has ended and no further data is available, which is different from the original behavior.

DONE.
