  Option 1: The PLATEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nil
```
This would result in different behavior because this code nil is `nil`, instead of `continuer.bind`, which is a function. The result is that the callback will not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because this code use `apply` instead of `bind`, which is also a function. The result is that the callback will be called, but with a different `this` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(verb, arg) {}
```
This would result in different behavior because this code defines a new function that does not have the same behavior as `continuer.bind`. The result is that the callback may not be called, or it may be called with a different `this` value.

DONE.
