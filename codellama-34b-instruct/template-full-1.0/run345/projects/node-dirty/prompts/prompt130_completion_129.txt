  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [value, cbs] = this._queue.shift();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was using the `Pop()` method to remove the first element from the queue, but this would remove the last element instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, cbs] = ["fake_key", []];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was using the `key` and `value` from the queue element, but this would always use the same `fake_key` value and an empty array for `cbs`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, cbs] = ["key", ["fake_cb"]];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was using the `key` and `value` from the queue element, but this would always use the same `key` value and an array with a single `fake_cb` function for `
