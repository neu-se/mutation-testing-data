  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be pushed to the `ops` array, which would cause the `slice` method to return a `Delta` object with a different set of operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be pushed to the `ops` array, which would cause the `slice` method to return a `Delta` object with a different set of operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[index - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this.ops[index - 1]` value would be pushed to the `ops` array, which would cause the `slice` method to return a `Delta` object with a different set of operations.

DONE.
