  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substr(0, w.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last character of the word, rather than replacing it with "ves".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last character of the word, rather than replacing it with "ves".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substring(0, w.length - 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last two characters of the word, rather than replacing the last character with "ves".

DONE.
