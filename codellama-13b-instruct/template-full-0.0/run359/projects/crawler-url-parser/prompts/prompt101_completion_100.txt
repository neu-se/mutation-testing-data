  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.get(currentUrl.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method returns the value of the specified key, whereas the original code fragment returns the value of the specified key and its corresponding value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set(currentUrl.url, currentUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method sets the value of the specified key, whereas the original code fragment sets the value of the specified key and its corresponding value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.has(currentUrl.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `has` method returns a boolean indicating whether the specified key exists in the map, whereas the original code fragment returns the value of the specified key and its corresponding value.

DONE.
