  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c < d
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat negative values of `c` and `d` differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c > d
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat negative values of `c` and `d` differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
|c| < |d|
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat negative values of `c` and `d` differently.

DONE.
