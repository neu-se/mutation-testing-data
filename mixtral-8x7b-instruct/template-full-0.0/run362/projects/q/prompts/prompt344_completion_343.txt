 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the resolved value would always be 1, regardless of the original promise's value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the resolved value would be a random number between 0 and 1, instead of the original promise's value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the resolved value would be the promise itself, creating a recursive promise that never settles.

DONE.
