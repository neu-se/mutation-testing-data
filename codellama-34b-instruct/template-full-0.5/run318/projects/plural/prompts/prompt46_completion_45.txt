  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiouy]o$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment includes the `i` flag, which makes the regular expression case-insensitive. The new code fragment does not include this flag, so it would only match words that end in "o" in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiouy]o$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include the `i` flag, so it would only match words that end in "o" in the original code fragment. The new code fragment includes this flag, so it would match words that end in "O" as well.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiouy]o$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include the `i` flag, so it would only match words that end in "o" in
