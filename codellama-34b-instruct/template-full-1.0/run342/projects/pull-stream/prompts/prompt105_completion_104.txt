  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid argument for the `drain` function, and would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is not a valid argument for the `drain` function, and would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because `'foo'` is a string, and would cause the `drain` function to try to consume a string instead of a stream.

DONE.
