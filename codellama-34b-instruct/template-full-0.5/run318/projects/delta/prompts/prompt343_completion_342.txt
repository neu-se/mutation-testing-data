  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler(embedType).invert(opData, baseOpData)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `invert` method on the `embedType` object, which is not defined in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler(embedType).transform(opData, baseOpData, priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `transform` method on the `embedType` object with the `priority` argument, which is not defined in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler(embedType).transform(opData, baseOpData, !priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `transform` method on the `embedType` object with the `!priority` argument, which is not defined in the original code.

DONE.
