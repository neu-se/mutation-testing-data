 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
zipArchive.bulk([{}])
```
This would result in different behavior because `bulk` is not a valid method for the `archiver` object, and it would throw an error instead of finalizing the archive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
zipArchive.finalize().catch(() => {})
