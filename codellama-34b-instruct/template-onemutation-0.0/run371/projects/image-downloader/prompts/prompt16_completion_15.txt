  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.replace(/^/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options.dest` is a string, while the new code fragment `options.dest.replace(/^/, '')` is a regular expression that matches the start of the string and replaces it with an empty string. This change would cause the `path.join` function to receive a different argument, potentially leading to a different file path being generated.

DONE.
