  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type(rule[0]) === 'String' && rule[0] !== word
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking if the word is not equal to the rule's string value, which would invert the logic and cause the rule to be applied for any word that is not equal to the rule's string value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type(rule[0]) === 'String' && rule[0] === word.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking if the word is equal to the rule's string value after converting it to lowercase, which would cause the rule to be applied to words that are equal to the rule's string value in lowercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type(rule[0]) === 'RegExp' && rule[0].test(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking if the word
