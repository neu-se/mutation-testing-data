  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const φ1 = π - Math.abs(φ1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the replaced fragment modifies the value of φ1, which is used later in the formula for calculating the bearing. The result would be an incorrect bearing value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const φ1 = φ2 - φ1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the replaced fragment changes the order of the values in the calculation of the bearing. The result would be an incorrect bearing value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const φ1 = Math.atan2(Math.sin(φ1), Math.cos(φ1));
```
This would result in different behavior because the replaced fragment computes the arctangent of the sine and cosine of φ1, which is not equivalent to the original formula. The result would be an incorrect bearing value.

DONE.
