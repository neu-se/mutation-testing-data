  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `object` to be a promise or an immediate reference, but `null` is neither of those things.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `object` to be a promise or an immediate reference, but `undefined` is neither of those things.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(function() { return null; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `object` to be a promise or an immediate reference, but `Q(object).then(function() { return null; })` is a promise that resolves to `null`.

DONE.
