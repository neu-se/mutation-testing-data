  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.href
```
This would result in different behavior because `parsedUrl.href` is a string representation of the URL, while `parsedUrl` is an object containing the parsed URL components.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.protocol + '//' + parsedUrl.host + parsedUrl.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the protocol and hostname in the URL, which may not be present in the original URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.pathname + parsedUrl.search
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the pathname and search query in the URL, which may not be present in the original URL.

DONE.
