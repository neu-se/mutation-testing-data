  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
operands[2]
```
This change will cause the `progressListener` to be called with the second operand instead of the first, which may cause unexpected behavior in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
operands[0]
```
This change will cause the `progressListener` to be called with the first operand instead of the second, which may cause unexpected behavior in the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
operands[3]
```
This change will cause the `progressListener` to be called with the fourth operand instead of the second, which may cause unexpected behavior in the program.

DONE.
