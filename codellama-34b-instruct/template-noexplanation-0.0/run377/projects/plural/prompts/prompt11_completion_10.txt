  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ies' }
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it removes one more character from the end of the word before adding the "ies" suffix. This will result in incorrect pluralization for words that end in "y" but not "ies".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'es' }
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it adds the "es" suffix instead of "ies". This will result in incorrect pluralization for words that end in "y" but not "es".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 's' }
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it adds the "s" suffix
