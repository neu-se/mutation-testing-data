  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the tangent of the angle rather than the cosine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the sine of the angle rather than the cosine.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the hyperbolic cosine of the angle rather than the cosine.

DONE.
