  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule[0]` is a regular expression object, whereas `rule[1]` is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString` is a function that returns a string representation of an object, whereas `rule[1]` is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a special value in JavaScript that represents "not a number", whereas `rule[1]` is a string.

DONE.
