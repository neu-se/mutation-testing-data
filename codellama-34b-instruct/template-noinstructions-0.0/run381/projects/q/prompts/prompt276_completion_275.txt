  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw error
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws the error if the promise is rejected, while this new code fragment would throw the error regardless of whether the promise is resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return error
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only returns the error if the promise is rejected, while this new code fragment would return the error regardless of whether the promise is resolved or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only logs the error to the console if the promise is rejected, while this new code fragment would log the error to the console regardless of whether the promise is resolved or rejected.

DONE.
