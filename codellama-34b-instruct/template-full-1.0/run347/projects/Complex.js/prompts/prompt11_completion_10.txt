  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.pow` expects two arguments, whereas `Math.exp` expects one argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function noop() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `function noop() {}` always returns `undefined`, whereas `Math.exp` returns the exponential value of its argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because `1` is a constant value, whereas `Math.exp` is a function that expects an argument and returns a value.

DONE.
