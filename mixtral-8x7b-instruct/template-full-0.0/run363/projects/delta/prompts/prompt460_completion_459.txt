 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rest()` method would skip an operation in the list after accessing it once, causing it to return an incorrect subset of the operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rest()` method would always return the last operation in the list, regardless of the current position, causing it to return an incorrect subset of the operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rest()` method would always return the last operation in the list, regardless of the current position, causing it to return an incorrect subset of the operations.

DONE.
