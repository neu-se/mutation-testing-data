  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y
```
This would result in different behavior because the `join` method would be called on `y` instead of `x`, which could lead to a different result if `y` is not equal to `x`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + y
```
This would result in different behavior because the `join` method would be called on the result of `x + y` instead of `x`, which could lead to a different result if `x + y` is not equal to `x`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `join` method would be called on `null` instead of `x`, which would likely lead to an error or unexpected result.

DONE.
