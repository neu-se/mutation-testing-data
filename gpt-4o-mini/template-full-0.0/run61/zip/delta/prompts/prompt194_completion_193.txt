Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check if there are no more operations in `otherIter`, which would always evaluate to true, potentially leading to incorrect concatenation of operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it alters the condition to check if `otherIter` has no next operation based on a numeric comparison, which would always be false, causing the optimization block to never execute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext() && otherIter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an additional condition that checks the type of the next operation in `otherIter`, which could prevent the optimization from executing if the next operation is not a 'retain', leading to potentially incorrect delta composition.

DONE.
