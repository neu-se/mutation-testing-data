  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0]
```
This will cause the function to return the first element of the `rule` array, which is a regular expression, instead of the second element, which is the replacement string. This will result in the function returning the original word instead of the plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1] + 's'
```
This will cause the function to return the second element of the `rule` array, which is the replacement string, followed by the letter 's'. This will result in the function returning the plural form of the word, but with an extra 's' at the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1].toUpperCase()
```
This will cause the function to return the second element of the `rule` array, which is the replacement string, but with all letters in uppercase. This will result in the function returning the plural form of the word, but with all letters in uppercase.
