  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the deprecated timezones, regardless of the `deprecated` option passed to the `getAllTimezones` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the non-deprecated timezones, regardless of the `deprecated` option passed to the `getAllTimezones` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = !options.deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because it would toggle the `deprecated` option passed to the `getAllTimezones` function, causing the function to return the opposite set of timezones.

DONE.
