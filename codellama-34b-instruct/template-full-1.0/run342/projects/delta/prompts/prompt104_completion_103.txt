  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(<PLACEHOLDER>() ===== function(op, index) { return op.insert == null; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function checks if the `insert` property of the `op` object is null, but the mutation modifies the `insert` property of the newOp object, which is then inserted into the ops array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(<PLACEHOLDER>() ===== function(op, index) { return op.attributes == null; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function checks if the `attributes` property of the `op` object is null, but the mutation modifies the `attributes` property of the newOp object, which is then inserted into the ops array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(<PLACEHOLDER>() ===== function(op, index) { return op.retain == null; })
```
