  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument is being passed to the `dispatch` method, which could cause the method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs.slice(0, -1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the last argument is being removed from the `nodeArgs` array, which could cause the method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs.concat(["extra argument"])]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument is being added to the `nodeArgs` array, which could cause the method to behave differently.

DONE.
