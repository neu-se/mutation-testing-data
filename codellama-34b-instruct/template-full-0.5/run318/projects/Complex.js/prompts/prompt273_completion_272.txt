  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the argument passed to the `Math.atan2` function, which is used to calculate the angle of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the real part of the complex number, which would change the result of the `logHypot` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] - this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the real part from the imaginary part, which would change the result of the `cosm1` function.

DONE.
