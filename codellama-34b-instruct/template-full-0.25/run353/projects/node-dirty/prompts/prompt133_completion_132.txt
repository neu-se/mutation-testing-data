  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because `clear()` removes all elements from the queue, whereas `delete()` only removes the specified element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.shift();
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift()` removes the first element from the queue, whereas `delete()` removes the specified element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` removes the last element from the queue, whereas `delete()` removes the specified element.

DONE.
