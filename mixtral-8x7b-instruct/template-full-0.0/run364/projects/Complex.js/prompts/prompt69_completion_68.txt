 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse_exit()` function would not be called even if the input is not a number, and the `z` object would have `NaN` values for both `re` and `im`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse_exit()` function would not be called even if the input is not a number, and the `z` object would have `Infinity` or `-Infinity` values for `re` and `im`, depending on the sign of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'invalid'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse_exit()` function would not be called even if the input is not a number, and the `z` object would have `'invalid'` strings for both `re` and `im`. This would cause
