  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!shouldThrow
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `shouldThrow`, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if `shouldThrow` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
shouldThrow === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, so if `shouldThrow` is `true`, the `if` statement would evaluate to `false`, even if `shouldThrow` is `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
shouldThrow !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, so if `shouldThrow` is `true`, the `if` statement would evaluate to `false`, even if `shouldThrow` is `true`.

DONE.
