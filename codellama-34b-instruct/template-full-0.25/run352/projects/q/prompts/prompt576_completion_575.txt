  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(null, "next")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `continuer` function would be called with `null` as the `this` context, rather than the `generator` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(generator, "next")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `continuer` function would be called with the `generator` object as the `this` context, rather than the `continuer` function itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "next")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `continuer` function would be called with the `continuer` function itself as the `this` context, rather than the `generator` object.

DONE.
