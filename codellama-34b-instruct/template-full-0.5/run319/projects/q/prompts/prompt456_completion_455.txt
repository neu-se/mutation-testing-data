  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_lastIndexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_lastIndexOf` returns the index of the last occurrence of the element in the array, whereas `array_indexOf` returns the index of the first occurrence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_includes` returns a boolean indicating whether the element is present in the array, whereas `array_indexOf` returns the index of the element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_findIndex
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_findIndex` returns the index of the first element that satisfies the provided testing function, whereas `array_indexOf` returns the index of the element.

DONE.
