  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.once
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.once` will only fire once, whereas `output.on` will fire every time the event occurs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.off
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.off` will remove the event listener entirely, whereas `output.on` will keep it active.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.emit
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.emit` will manually trigger the event, whereas `output.on` will only listen for it.

DONE.
