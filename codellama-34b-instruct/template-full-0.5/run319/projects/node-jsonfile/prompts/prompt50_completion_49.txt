  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, str, options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.encoding` is not the same as `options`, and the `stringify` function may not handle the encoding properly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, str, options.throws
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.throws` is not the same as `options`, and the `JSON.parse` function may not handle the throws option properly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, str, options.reviver
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.reviver` is not the same as `options`, and the `JSON.parse` function may not handle the reviver option properly.

DONE.
