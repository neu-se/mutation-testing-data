  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `error` object is thrown if the queue is closed, but with `null`, nothing is thrown and the `get` method will return `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("Queue is closed")
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `error` object is thrown if the queue is closed, but with `new Error("Queue is closed")`, a new error object is thrown with a different message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `error` object is thrown if the queue is closed, but with `Q.reject(error)`, the promise is rejected with the `error` object, which could cause the `get` method to return a rejected promise instead of throwing an error.

DONE.
