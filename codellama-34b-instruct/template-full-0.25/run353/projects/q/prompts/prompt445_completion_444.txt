  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection", reason, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process.emit` function would not be called, and the unhandled rejection would not be tracked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled", reason, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process.emit` function would be called with the wrong event name, and the rejection would not be handled correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledFulfillment", reason, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process.emit` function would be called with the wrong event name, and the fulfillment would not be handled correctly.

DONE.
