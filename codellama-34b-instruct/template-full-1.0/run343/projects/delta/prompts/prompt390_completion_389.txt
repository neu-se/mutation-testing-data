  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.peekLength(100)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the fragment instead of the length of the peeked operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.peekLength() + 10
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 10 to the length of the fragment instead of the length of the peeked operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the length of the fragment by 2 instead of the length of the peeked operation.

DONE.
