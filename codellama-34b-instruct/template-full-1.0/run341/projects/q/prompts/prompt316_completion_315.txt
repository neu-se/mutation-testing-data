  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect !== void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because if `inspect` is not `void 0`, it will return `true`, which means the `if` block will be executed, but it should be moved to the `else` block.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect === true
```
This would result in different behavior because if `inspect` is not `true`, it will return `false`, which means the `if` block will not be executed, but it should be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect !== inspect
```
This would result in different behavior because if `inspect` is not the same as itself, it will return `false`, which means the `if` block will not be executed, but it should be executed.

DONE.
