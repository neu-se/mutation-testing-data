  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Op.length` method returns the length of the operation, which is not necessarily the same as the length of the string or array being operated on. Using `0` would cause the `retain` method to retain zero characters, which would likely cause unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Op.length` method returns the length of the operation, which is not necessarily the same as the length of the string or array being operated on. Using `1` would cause the `retain` method to retain one character, which would likely cause unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property is not defined on the `Op` object. Using `length` would cause a reference error, which would likely cause the code to fail.

DONE.
