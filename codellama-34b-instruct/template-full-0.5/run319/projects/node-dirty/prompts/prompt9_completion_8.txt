  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, val + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value being set is now different than the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, val * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value being set is now twice the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, val.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the value being set is now the uppercase version of the original value.

DONE.
