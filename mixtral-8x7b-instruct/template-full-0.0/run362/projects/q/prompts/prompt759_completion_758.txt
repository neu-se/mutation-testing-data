 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
allResolved, "allResolved", "all"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allSettled` function would be using the `all` function instead of its own implementation, which could lead to incorrect results when handling an array of promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
allResolved, "allResolved", Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allSettled` function would treat all input promises as resolved, regardless of their actual status. This would cause incorrect results when handling an array of promises with different statuses.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
allResolved, function() { return Promise.resolve(); }, "allSettled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allSettled` function would use a custom function that always returns a resolved promise, instead of the original `allResolved` function. This would cause incorrect results when
