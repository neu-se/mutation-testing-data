  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Array.from(urlMap.values());
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Map.prototype.values()` method to get an array of the map's values, while this replacement code uses the `Array.from()` method to create an array from the map's values. The `Array.from()` method is more flexible and can handle iterable objects, but it may also have a performance overhead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Array.from(urlMap.entries());
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Map.prototype.values()` method to get an array of the map's values, while this replacement code uses the `Array.from()` method to create an array from the map's entries. The `Map.prototype.entries()` method returns an array of key-value pairs, so this replacement code would return an array of objects with `url` and `text` properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOL
