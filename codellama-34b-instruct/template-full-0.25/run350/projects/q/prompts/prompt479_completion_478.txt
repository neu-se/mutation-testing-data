  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would remove the first element of the `unhandledRejections` array, rather than the second element as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at, -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would remove the last element of the `unhandledReasons` array, rather than the second element as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would remove the third element of the `unhandledRejections` array, rather than the second element as intended.

DONE.
