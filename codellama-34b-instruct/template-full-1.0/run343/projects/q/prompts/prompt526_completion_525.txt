  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the first argument to `dispatch`, rather than passing all the arguments as an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass all but the first argument to `dispatch`, rather than passing all the arguments as an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[args[0]]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass only the first argument to `dispatch`, rather than passing all the arguments as an array.

DONE.
