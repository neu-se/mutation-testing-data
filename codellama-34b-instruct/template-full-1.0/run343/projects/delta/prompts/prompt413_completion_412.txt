  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!

Option 1:
```
thisIter.peekLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add an extra character to the length of the peeked element, which could cause the program to skip over certain iterations or produce incorrect results.

Option 2:
```
thisIter.nextLength
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retrieve the length of the next element in the iteration, rather than the current element. This could cause the program to skip over certain elements or repeat iterations.

Option 3:
```
thisIter.prevNext
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retrieve the next element in the iteration, rather than the current element. This could cause the program to skip over certain elements or repeat iterations.

DONE.
