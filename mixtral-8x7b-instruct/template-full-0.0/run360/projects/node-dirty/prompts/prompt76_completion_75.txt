 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would emit with a value of -1 instead of 0 when the file doesn't exist.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would emit with a value of null instead of 0 when the file doesn't exist.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'{}'
