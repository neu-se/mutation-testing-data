 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` function would receive `null` instead of a function for the `onFulfilled` property of the promise's handlers, causing it to throw an error and not correctly process the promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function (value) { return value; }, function (reason) { throw reason; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` handler would immediately throw the error instead of waiting for the promise to settle, causing the `finally` handler to not be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function (value) { return Q.resolve(value); }, function (reason) { return Q.reject(reason); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would wrap the resolved value or rejected reason in a new promise, which could cause issues if the downstream code expects the original value or reason.
