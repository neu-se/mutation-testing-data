  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"http://www.stackoverflow.com/aaa/bbb/"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` variable is not defined in the current scope, and the code would throw a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"http://journals.tubitak.gov.tr/genel/telifhakki.pdf"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` variable is a string, and the code would attempt to call the `replace` method on a string, which is not defined.
