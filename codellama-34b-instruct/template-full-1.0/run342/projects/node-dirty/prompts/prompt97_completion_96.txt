  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emitter
```
This would result in different behavior because `emit` is a function, but `emitter` is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emitter.emit
```
This would result in different behavior because `emitter` is undefined and it would throw a reference error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emitFoo
```
This would result in different behavior because `emitFoo` is undefined and it would throw a reference error.

DONE.
