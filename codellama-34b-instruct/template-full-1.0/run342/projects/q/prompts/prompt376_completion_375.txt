  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` and `deferred.reject` are different methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` and `deferred.resolve` are different methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` and `promise.reject` are different methods.

DONE.
