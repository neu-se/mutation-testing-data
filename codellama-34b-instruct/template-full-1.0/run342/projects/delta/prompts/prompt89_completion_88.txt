  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow for the possibility of `newOp.attributes` being `null`, whereas the original code fragment assumed that `newOp.attributes` would always be an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.attributes === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat `newOp.attributes` as a string, whereas the original code fragment treated it as an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only allow for the possibility of `newOp.attributes` being an object with a `length` property greater than 0, whereas the original code fragment allowed for any type of object.

DONE.
