  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path.extname()` method would be called on the `options.url` string, which is not a file path, and would likely return an empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path.extname()` method would be called on the `options.dest.pathname` string, which is not a file path, and would likely return an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.basename
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path.extname()` method would be called on the `options.dest.basename` string, which is not a file path, and would likely return an empty string.

DONE.
