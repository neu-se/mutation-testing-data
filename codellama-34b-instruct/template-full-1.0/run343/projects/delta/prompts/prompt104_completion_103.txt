  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(op, index) { return op.insert != null; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` property is not being checked in the original code and would return different values in the `predicate` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(op, index) { return op.retain > 0; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property is not being checked in the original code and would return different values in the `predicate` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(op) { return op.retain <= 0; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property is not being checked in the original code and would return different values in the `predicate` function.

DONE.
