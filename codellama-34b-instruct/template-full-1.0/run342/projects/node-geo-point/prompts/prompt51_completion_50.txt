  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude + point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the + operator would add the two longitudes together, resulting in a different calculated distance than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude - 10
```
This would result in different behavior because a constant value of 10 would be subtracted from the longitude of point2, resulting in a different calculated distance than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(point2.longitude) - sin(point1.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the trigonometric functions cos and sin would be applied to the longitudes, resulting in a different calculated distance than the original code fragment.

DONE.
