  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).tap(function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a no-op, while the new code fragment would execute the provided function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).tap(Q.resolve)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a no-op, while the new code fragment would resolve the promise with the provided value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).tap(Q.reject)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a no-op, while the new code fragment would reject the promise with the provided reason.

DONE.
