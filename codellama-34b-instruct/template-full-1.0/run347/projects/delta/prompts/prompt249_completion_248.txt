  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (thisOp.insert == null) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `thisOp.insert` is of type `string`, while this modified code checks if it is null or undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (thisOp.insert == false) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `thisOp.insert` is of type `string`, while this modified code checks if it is falsey.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (thisOp.insert == 'abc') {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `thisOp.insert` is of type `string`, while this modified code checks if it is equal to the string 'abc'.

DONE.
