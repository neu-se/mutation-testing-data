  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.bind(this)` creates a new function that is bound to the current `this` context, whereas `this.dispatch` is a reference to the `dispatch` method on the current `this` context. If the `this` context is changed, `this.dispatch` would still refer to the original `dispatch` method, but `this.dispatch.bind(this)` would refer to a new `dispatch` method that is bound to the new `this` context.
