  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start + index
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is subtracting the `index` from `start`, while this replacement code fragment is adding them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start * index
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is subtracting the `index` from `start`, while this replacement code fragment is multiplying them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start / index
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is subtracting the `index` from `start`, while this replacement code fragment is dividing them.

DONE.
