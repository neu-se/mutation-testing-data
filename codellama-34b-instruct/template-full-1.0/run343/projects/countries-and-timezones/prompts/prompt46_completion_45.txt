  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.country
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.country` is not defined and would produce a runtime error, whereas the original code fragment `options` is a object that contains information related to the request.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ ...options, country: 'USA' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options` is an object that contains information related to the request, but this new object creates a new property `country` with the value `'USA'`, which may not be what the original code intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
module.exports.getCountry(options)
```
This would result in different behavior because `getCountry` is a function that returns a country object based on the given `options` object, but the original code fragment `options` is a object that contains information related to the request, not a function that returns a country object.

DONE.
