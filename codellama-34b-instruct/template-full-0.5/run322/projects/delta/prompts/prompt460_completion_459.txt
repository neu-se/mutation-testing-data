  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the `ops` array instead of the current index, which could cause the `rest()` method to return a different set of operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the index of the next operation instead of the current one, which could cause the `rest()` method to return a different set of operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the index of the previous operation instead of the current one, which could cause the `rest()` method to return a different set of operations.

DONE.
