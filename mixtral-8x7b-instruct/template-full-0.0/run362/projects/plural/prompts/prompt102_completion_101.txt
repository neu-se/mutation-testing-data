 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/^\b(?:bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep)\b/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the global flag `g` is added, causing the regular expression to match all occurrences of the specified words instead of just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/^\b(?:bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep)\b/i
