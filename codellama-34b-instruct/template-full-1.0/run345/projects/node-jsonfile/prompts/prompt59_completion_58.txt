  Sure, here are three mutations of the original code:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/./g, EOL
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex pattern is now matching any character, not just newlines.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^/g, EOL
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex pattern is now matching the beginning of a string, not just newlines.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/.*/g, EOL
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex pattern is now matching any number of characters, not just newlines.

DONE.
