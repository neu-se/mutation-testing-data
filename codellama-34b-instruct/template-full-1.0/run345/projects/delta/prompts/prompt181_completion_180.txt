  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was missing the parentheses, resulting in a reference to the function `next` instead of calling it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was calling `next`, which consumes the next value from the iterator, while `peek` only inspects the next value without consuming it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking the next value from the iterator, while `hasNext` checks whether there are any more values in the iterator.

DONE.
