  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `key` property is absent in the `row` object, while this code checks if the `key` property is `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof row.key === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `key` property is absent in the `row` object, while this code checks if the `key` property is `undefined` or if it has not been declared.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key !== 'key'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `key` property is absent in the `row` object, while this code checks if the `key` property is not equal to the string `'key'`.

DONE.
