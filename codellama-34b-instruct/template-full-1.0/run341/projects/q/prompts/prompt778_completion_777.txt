  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.state === "fulfilled" ? promise.value : promise.reason;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the fulfillment value instead of the rejection reason when the promise is rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.state === "pending" ? promise.value : promise.reason;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the fulfillment value instead of the rejection reason when the promise is pending.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.state === "rejected" ? promise.reason : promise.value;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the rejection reason instead of the fulfillment value when the promise is fulfilled.

DONE.
