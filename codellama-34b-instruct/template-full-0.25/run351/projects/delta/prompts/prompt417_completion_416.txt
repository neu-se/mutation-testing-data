  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance to the next operation, potentially skipping over operations that should be applied.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance to the next operation, potentially skipping over operations that should be applied, and it would also pass the length of the current operation as an argument to the next operation, which could cause unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(length + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance to the next operation, potentially skipping over operations that should be applied, and it would also pass the length of the current operation plus one as an argument to the next operation, which could cause unexpected behavior.

DONE.
