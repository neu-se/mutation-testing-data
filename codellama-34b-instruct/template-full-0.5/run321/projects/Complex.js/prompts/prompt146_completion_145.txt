  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `div` function to return `NaN` when the divisor is zero, whereas the original code would return `Infinity`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `div` function to return `NaN` when the dividend is zero, whereas the original code would return `Infinity`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `div` function to return `NaN` when the divisor is zero, whereas the original code would return `Infinity`.

DONE.
