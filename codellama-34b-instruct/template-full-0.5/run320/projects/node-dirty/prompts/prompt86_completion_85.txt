  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\t'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the buffer into rows based on the newline character, while the new code fragment splits the buffer into rows based on the tab character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\r'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the buffer into rows based on the newline character, while the new code fragment splits the buffer into rows based on the carriage return character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the buffer into rows based on the newline character, while the new code fragment splits the buffer into rows based on an empty string, which would result in all the data being stored in a single row.

DONE.
