Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.parse` attempts to convert a JSON string into a JavaScript object, which is the opposite of what `JSON.stringify` does, potentially leading to errors if the input is not a valid JSON string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because calling `toString()` on an object may not produce a valid JSON representation, especially for complex objects, leading to loss of data or incorrect formatting.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(obj, null, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because adding a number as the third argument to `JSON.stringify` changes the indentation of the output, which may not match the expected formatting defined by the `spaces` parameter.

DONE.
