  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `b` would be incremented by 1, which would affect the final result of the computation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `b` would be decremented by 1, which would also affect the final result of the computation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-2 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the value of `b` would be flipped, which would affect the final result of the computation.

DONE.
