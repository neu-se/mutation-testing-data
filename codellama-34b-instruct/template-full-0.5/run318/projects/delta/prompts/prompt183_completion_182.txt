  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `retain` property of the `otherOp` object to be treated as a `delete` operation, which could lead to incorrect or unexpected results in the `compose` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `retain` property of the `thisOp` object to be treated as a `delete` operation, which could lead to incorrect or unexpected results in the `compose` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `retain` property of the `otherOp` object to be treated as an `insert` operation, which could lead to incorrect or unexpected results in the `compose` method.

DONE.
