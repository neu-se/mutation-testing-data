  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the first element of the `ops` array, which is not included in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the third element of the `ops` array, which is not included in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the second element of the `ops` array, which is not included in the original code fragment.

DONE.
