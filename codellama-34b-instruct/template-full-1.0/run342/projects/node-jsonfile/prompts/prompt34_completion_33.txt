  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + file
```
This would result in different behavior because the `1 + file` expression would return a different value than the original `file` expression, which could cause the `_readFile()` function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `file + 1` expression would return a different value than the original `file` expression, which could cause the `_readFile()` function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `file.toString()` expression would return a different value than the original `file` expression, which could cause the `_readFile()` function to behave differently.

DONE.
