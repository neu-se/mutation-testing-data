  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ices' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was supposed to add the suffix "-ices" to words that end with "ix", but the replaced code fragment would add the suffix "-ices" to words that end with "ex".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ices' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was supposed to add the suffix "-ices" to words that end with "ix", but the replaced code fragment would add the suffix "-ices" to words that end with "ix" and "ex".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
