Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof console === "undefined" ||
            typeof console.warn !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the opposite conditions, meaning the warning will be logged if `console` is undefined or if `console.warn` is not a function, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof console === "object" &&
            typeof console.log === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for `console.log` instead of `console.warn`, which means that the deprecation warning will only be logged if `console.log` is available, potentially skipping the warning if only `console.warn` is defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof console !== "undefined" &&
            typeof console.warn === "string"
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly checks if `console.warn` is a string instead of a function, which will always evaluate to false, preventing the warning from being logged even if `console.warn` is defined and functional.

DONE.
