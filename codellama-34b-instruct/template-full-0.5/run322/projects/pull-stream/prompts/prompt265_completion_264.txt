  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the `data` parameter of the `nextChunk` function, which is a stream of data. Replacing it with `null` would cause the function to return `null` instead of the expected stream of data, leading to unexpected behavior in the `flatten` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the `data` parameter of the `nextChunk` function, which is a stream of data. Replacing it with `undefined` would cause the function to return `undefined` instead of the expected stream of data, leading to unexpected behavior in the `flatten` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
