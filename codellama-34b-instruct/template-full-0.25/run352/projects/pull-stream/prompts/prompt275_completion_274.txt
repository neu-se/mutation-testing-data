  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.pipe(process.stdout)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pipe the stream to the stdout, whereas the original code fragment would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.pipe(process.stderr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pipe the stream to the stderr, whereas the original code fragment would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.pipe(fs.createWriteStream('output.txt'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pipe the stream to a file, whereas the original code fragment would not.

DONE.
