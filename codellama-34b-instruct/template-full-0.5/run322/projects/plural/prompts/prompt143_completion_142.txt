  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"number"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `type` function would return "number" instead of the type of the object, which would cause the pluralization rules to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `type` function would return "object" instead of the type of the object, which would cause the pluralization rules to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `type` function would return "undefined" instead of the type of the object, which would cause the pluralization rules to fail.

DONE.
