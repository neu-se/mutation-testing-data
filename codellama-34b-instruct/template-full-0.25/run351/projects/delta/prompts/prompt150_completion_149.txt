  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(firstLeft)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the `otherIter` iterator by `firstLeft` positions, potentially skipping over important operations in the `other` delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(firstLeft - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the `otherIter` iterator by `firstLeft - 1` positions, potentially skipping over important operations in the `other` delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(firstLeft + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the `otherIter` iterator by `firstLeft + 1` positions, potentially skipping over important operations in the `other` delta.

DONE.
