This would result in different behavior because `resolve` and `reject` are functions that are used to resolve or reject a promise, respectively. Using `resolve` instead of `reject` would cause the promise to be resolved, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that uses the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("oops")
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is a keyword that is used to throw an exception. Using `throw` instead of `reject` would cause the promise to be rejected with an error, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that uses the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(new Error("oops"))
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that is used to reject a promise with an error. Using `Q.reject` instead of `reject` would cause the promise to
