  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` removes the last element of an array, whereas `splice()` removes the element at a specific index. If the array has only one element, `pop()` would work correctly, but if the array has multiple elements, `splice()` would be necessary to remove the correct element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift()` removes the first element of an array, whereas `splice()` removes the element at a specific index. If the array has only one element, `shift()` would work correctly, but if the array has multiple elements, `splice()` would be necessary to remove the correct element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` creates a new
