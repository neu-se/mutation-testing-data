  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p.stack.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `slice()` method to extract a portion of the `stack` property, while the modified code fragment uses the `slice()` method to extract a portion of the `stack` property and then removes the last element of the resulting array using the `-1` index. This would cause the `makeStackTraceLong()` function to concatenate the stack trace of `promise` with a modified version of the error stack trace, which would have a different length and content than the original stack trace.
