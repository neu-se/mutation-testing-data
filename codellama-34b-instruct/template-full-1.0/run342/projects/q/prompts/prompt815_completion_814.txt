  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return promise.catch().then();
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.catch()` would catch any rejection errors and return a new promise that resolves with the error, whereas `promise.then()` would return a new promise that resolves with the original promise's result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return promise.then(function () {}, function () {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the first function passed to `promise.then()` will be called with the promise's result when it resolves, and the second function will be called with the rejection reason when the promise rejects. This is opposite to the original code, which uses the `regardless` function as the rejection handler.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return promise.then(function (result) {
    return result + 1;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `regardless` function returns the
