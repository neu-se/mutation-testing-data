  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback(error, value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only passes the error to the nodeback, while this modified code passes both the error and the value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback(null, error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes the error as the first argument to the nodeback, while this modified code passes it as the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback(value, error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes the value as the first argument to the nodeback, while this modified code passes it as the second argument.

DONE.
