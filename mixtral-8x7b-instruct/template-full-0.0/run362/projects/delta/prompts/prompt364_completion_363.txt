 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to consume one more operation than necessary, potentially skipping some operations in the `other` delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `thisIter` to consume one more operation than necessary, potentially skipping some operations in the `this` delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.max(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always consume the longer operation, potentially causing some operations to be skipped or processed incorrectly in either delta.

DONE.
