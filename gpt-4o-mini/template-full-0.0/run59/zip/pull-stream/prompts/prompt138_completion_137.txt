Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end)
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes the `end` value to the callback function instead of `null`, which could lead to different handling of the error or termination condition in the callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes `undefined` to the callback instead of the `end` value, which may not trigger the expected error handling in the callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb('error')
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes a string 'error' to the callback instead of the `end` value, which could lead to a different interpretation of the error state in the callback function.

DONE.
