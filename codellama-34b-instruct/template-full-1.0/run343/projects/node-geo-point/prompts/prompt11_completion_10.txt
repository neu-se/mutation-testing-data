  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'none'
```
This would result in different behavior because the GeoPoint constructor checks if the object has an own property named `'type'`, which would fail if the property is renamed to `'none'`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'geo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the GeoPoint constructor checks if the object has an own property named `'type'` with a value of `'Point'`, which would fail if the property is renamed to `'geo'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'0'
```
This would result in different behavior because the GeoPoint constructor checks if the object has an own property named `'coordinates'` with a length of 2, which would fail if the property is renamed to `'0'`.

DONE.
