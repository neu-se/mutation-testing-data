  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `arguments` object, which is not a constant and can be modified by the function. By replacing it with a constant, the function would not be able to modify the `args` variable and would behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"test"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `arguments` object, which is an array-like object and can be accessed using bracket notation. By replacing it with a string, the function would not be able to access the arguments in the same way and would behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return 1; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `arguments` object, which is an array-like object and can be accessed using bracket notation. By replacing it with a function, the function would not be able to access the arguments
