  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect = function () {
    return {state: "unknown"};
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` function would always return the same value, whereas in the original code it could return different values based on the current state of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect = function () {
    return {state: "fullfilled"};
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` function would always return the same value, whereas in the original code it could return different values based on the current state of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect = function () {
    return {state: "fullfilled", reason: new Error()};
};
```
