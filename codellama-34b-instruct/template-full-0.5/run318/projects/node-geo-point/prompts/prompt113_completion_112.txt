  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude * Math.PI / 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the longitude value instead of the latitude value, which would cause the calculation of the tile coordinates to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 181
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a different value for the conversion factor from degrees to radians, which would cause the calculation of the tile coordinates to be off by a small amount.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 180 + 0.00001
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a small offset to the latitude value before converting it to radians, which would cause the calculation of the tile coordinates to be slightly different.

DONE.
