  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...
      case diff.DELETE:
        opLength = Math.min(otherIter.peekLength() * 2, length, thisIter.peekLength());
...
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison operator used for the Math.min() function has changed from '<=' to '<'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...
      case diff.DELETE:
        if (length < thisIter.peekLength()) {
          opLength = Math.min(thisIter.peekLength(), length);
        } else {
          opLength = otherIter.peekLength();
        }
...
```
This would result in different behavior because a conditional statement has been introduced to determine the size of the deleted text, which would change the outcome of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...
      case diff.DELETE:
        opLength = length + otherIter.peekLength();
