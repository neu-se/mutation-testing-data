  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always return 1, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always return 2, regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always return 3, regardless of the input.

DONE.
