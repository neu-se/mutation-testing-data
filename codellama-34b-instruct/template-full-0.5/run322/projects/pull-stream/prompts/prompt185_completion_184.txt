  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `true` if `i >= array.length`, but the mutated code fragment returns `false` in the same scenario.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `true` if `i >= array.length`, but the mutated code fragment returns `null` in the same scenario.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `true` if `i >= array.length`, but the mutated code fragment returns `false` in the same scenario.

DONE.
