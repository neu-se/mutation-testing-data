  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Deferred()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new Deferred object, whereas the original code fragment uses the existing Deferred object created by the generator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(deferred)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would wrap the Deferred object in a promise, whereas the original code fragment uses the Deferred object directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function (deferred) {
    return deferred.promise;
})(deferred)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that resolves to the same value as the Deferred object, whereas the original code fragment uses the Deferred object directly.

DONE.
