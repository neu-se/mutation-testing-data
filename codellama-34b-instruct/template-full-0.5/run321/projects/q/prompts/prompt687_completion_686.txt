  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass two arguments to the `array_slice` function, instead of one, which would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass zero arguments to the `array_slice` function, instead of one, which would cause the function to return an empty array, instead of an array containing the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the length of the `arguments` array as the second argument to the `array_slice` function, instead of the first argument, which would cause the function to return a different value.

DONE.
