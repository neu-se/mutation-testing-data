  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Math.sin(a) * sinh(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the signs of the two original terms are different, which would change the overall sign of the result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Math.sin(a) * cosh(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the signs of the two original terms are different, which would change the overall sign of the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(a) * sinh(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the signs of the two original terms are different, which would change the overall sign of the result.

DONE.
