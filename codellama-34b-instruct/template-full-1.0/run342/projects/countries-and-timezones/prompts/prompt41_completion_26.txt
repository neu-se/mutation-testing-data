  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `prev` returns the previous value in the iteration, while `prev + 1` will return a new value that is one more than the previous value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `prev` returns the previous value in the iteration, while `prev * 2` will return a new value that is twice the previous value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev + Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `prev` returns the previous value in the iteration, while `prev + Math.random()` will return a new value that is the previous value plus a random number.

DONE.
