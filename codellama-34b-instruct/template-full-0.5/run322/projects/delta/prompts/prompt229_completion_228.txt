  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increase the length of the peeked operation by one, which could cause the code to skip over a necessary operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrease the length of the peeked operation by one, which could cause the code to miss a necessary operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the length of the peeked operation, which could cause the code to perform unnecessary operations.

DONE.
