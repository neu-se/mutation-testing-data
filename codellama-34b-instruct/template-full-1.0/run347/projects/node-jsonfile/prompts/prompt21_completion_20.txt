  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file,
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFileSync()` expects an object as its second argument, but a string was provided. The function would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFileSync()` expects an object as its first argument, but a string was provided. The function would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFileSync(file, { buffer: true, throws: false })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buffer` option was set to `true`, which causes the function to return a buffer rather than a string. Additionally, the `throws` option was set to `false`, which would prevent the function from throwing an error in case of an invalid file path.

DONE.
