  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.lastIndexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastIndexOf` searches for the last occurrence of the specified value, whereas `indexOf` searches for the first occurrence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` checks if the specified value is present in the string, whereas `indexOf` checks if the specified value is the first character of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `startsWith` checks if the specified value is the first character of the string, whereas `indexOf` checks if the specified value is present anywhere in the string.

DONE.
