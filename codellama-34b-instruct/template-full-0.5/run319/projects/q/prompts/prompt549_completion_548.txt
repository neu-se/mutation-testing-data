  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.value` is always undefined for a promise, while `result.done` is a boolean indicating whether the promise has been fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.rejected` is a boolean indicating whether the promise has been rejected, while `result.done` is a boolean indicating whether the promise has been fulfilled or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!result.done
```
This would result in different behavior because `!result.done` is a boolean indicating whether the promise has not been fulfilled or rejected, while `result.done` is a boolean indicating whether the promise has been fulfilled or rejected.

DONE.
