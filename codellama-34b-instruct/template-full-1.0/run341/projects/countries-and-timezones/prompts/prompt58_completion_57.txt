  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getCountry` function to always return `undefined`, regardless of the value of the `id` parameter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getCountry` function to always return `null`, regardless of the value of the `id` parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getCountry` function to always return `0`, regardless of the value of the `id` parameter.

DONE.
