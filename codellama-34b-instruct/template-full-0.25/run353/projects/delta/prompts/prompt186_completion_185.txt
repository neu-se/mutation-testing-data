  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.retain` is an object and `null` is a primitive value, so the comparison would always return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain == undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value and `thisOp.retain` is an object, so the comparison would always return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value and `thisOp.retain` is an object, so the comparison would always return `false`.

DONE.
