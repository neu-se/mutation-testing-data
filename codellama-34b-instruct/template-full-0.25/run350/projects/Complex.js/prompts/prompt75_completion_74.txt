  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at 1 instead of 0, potentially skipping the first element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = tokens.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at the last element in the array instead of the first, potentially causing the loop to execute in reverse order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = Math.floor(Math.random() * tokens.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at a random index in the array, potentially causing the loop to execute in a random order.

DONE.
