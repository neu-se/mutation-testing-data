  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolved
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved instead of rejected, which would cause the `allSettled` method to return a promise that is fulfilled instead of rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(rejection)
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected with a different rejection reason, which would cause the `allSettled` method to return a promise that is rejected with a different reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(rejection)
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be notified with a rejection reason, which would cause the `allSettled` method to return a promise that is notified with a rejection reason.

DONE.
