 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function would receive `null` as an argument instead of a deferred object, and it would throw an error when trying to call methods like `defer.resolve()` or `defer.reject()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` would receive an empty object instead of a deferred object, and it would not be possible to call methods like `defer.resolve()` or `defer.reject()` on the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` would receive a function instead of a deferred object, and it would not be possible to call methods like `defer.resolve()` or `defer.reject()` on the function.

DONE.
