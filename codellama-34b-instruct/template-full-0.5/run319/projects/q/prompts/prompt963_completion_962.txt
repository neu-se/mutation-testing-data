  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` modifies the original array, while `unshift` creates a new array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` returns a new array, while `unshift` modifies the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` returns a shallow copy of the original array, while `unshift` modifies the original array.

DONE.
