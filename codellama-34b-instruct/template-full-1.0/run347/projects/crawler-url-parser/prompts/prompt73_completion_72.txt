  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'."
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the same attribute value for all elements, instead of returning the attribute value for each element individually.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'href.length'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the number of characters in the `href` attribute value, instead of the attribute value itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'document.querySelectorAll("base")[0].href'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `href` attribute value of the first `base` element in the document, instead of the attribute value of the current element.

DONE.
