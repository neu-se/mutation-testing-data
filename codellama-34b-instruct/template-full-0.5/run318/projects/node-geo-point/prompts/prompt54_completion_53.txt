  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the sin function has a different range and output than the cos function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This would result in different behavior because the tan function has a different range and output than the cos function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acos
```
This would result in different behavior because the acos function has a different range and output than the cos function.

DONE.
