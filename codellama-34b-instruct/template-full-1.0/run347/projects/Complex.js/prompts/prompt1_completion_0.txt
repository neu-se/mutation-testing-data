  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b * 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `a`, regardless of the value of `b`, whereas the original code would return the sum of `a` and `b`, but with a slight loss of precision due to the floating-point arithmetic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b * 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `a`, regardless of the value of `b`, whereas the original code would return the difference of `a` and `b`, but with a slight loss of precision due to the floating-point arithmetic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b * 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `a + b`, regardless of the value of `b`, whereas the original code would return the sum of `a` and `b`, but with a slight loss of precision due to the floating-point arithmetic.
