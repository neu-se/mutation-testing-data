  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.R_OK & fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the bitwise AND operator (`&`) is used instead of the bitwise OR operator (`|`). This would cause the `access` method to check if the file has both read and write permissions, rather than just one of them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.R_OK ^ fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the bitwise XOR operator (`^`) is used instead of the bitwise OR operator (`|`). This would cause the `access` method to check if the file has either read or write permissions, but not both.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.R_OK << fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the left shift operator (`<<`) is used instead of the bitwise OR operator (`|
