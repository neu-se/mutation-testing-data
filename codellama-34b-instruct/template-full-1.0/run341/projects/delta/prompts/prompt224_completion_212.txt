  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (!diffResult.equals(new Delta())) {
```
This would result in different behavior because `equals()` checks for deep equality, while `===` checks for reference equality. If `diffResult` is a complex object, `equals()` may return true even if the objects are not the same reference.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (typeof diffResult === 'undefined' || diffResult == null) {
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` checks the type of `diffResult`, while `===` checks for reference equality. If `diffResult` is `undefined` or `null`, `===` would return true, but `typeof` would return "undefined" or "object" respectively.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (diffResult.isEmpty() || diffResult.isAtomic()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because `isEmpty()` checks if `diffResult` is an empty delta, while `isAtomic
