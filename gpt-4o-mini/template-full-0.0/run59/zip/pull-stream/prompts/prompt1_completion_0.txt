Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k = 'invalid'
```
This would result in different behavior because it initializes `k` with a string value, causing the loop to not iterate over the properties of `sources`, leading to none of the properties being exported.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k = null
```
This would result in different behavior because `k` is initialized to `null`, which will not match any property names in `sources`, resulting in no properties being exported from `sources`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because initializing `k` as a number will cause the loop to not function correctly, as it will not iterate over the keys of `sources`, leading to an empty export from that object.

DONE.
