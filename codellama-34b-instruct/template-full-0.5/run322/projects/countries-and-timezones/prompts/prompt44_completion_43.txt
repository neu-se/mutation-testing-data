  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone
```
This would result in different behavior because `getTimezone` returns a different type of object (a timezone object) than `getCountry` (a country object).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountryForTimezone
```
This would result in different behavior because `getCountryForTimezone` takes a timezone name as an argument, while `getCountry` takes a country ID.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezonesForCountry
```
This would result in different behavior because `getTimezonesForCountry` returns an array of timezone objects, while `getCountry` returns a single country object.

DONE.
