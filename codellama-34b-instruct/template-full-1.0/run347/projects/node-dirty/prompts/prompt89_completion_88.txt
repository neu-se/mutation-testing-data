  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!rowObj
```
This would result in different behavior because 'rowObj' is not defined, so the expression would always evaluate to 'true', even if 'rowStr' is an empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!rowStr.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the length of 'rowStr' instead of just checking if it's falsy. If 'rowStr' is an empty string, it would evaluate to 'true', which would cause a different behavior than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.length !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the length of 'rowStr' explicitly, so if it's an empty string, it would evaluate to 'false', which would cause a different behavior than the original code fragment.

DONE.
