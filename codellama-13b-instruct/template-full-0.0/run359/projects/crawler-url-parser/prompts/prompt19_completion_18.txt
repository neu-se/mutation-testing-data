  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^\/\//, 'https://');
```
This would result in different behavior because the protocol of the base URL would be changed from "http" to "https". This could potentially cause issues if the code relies on the protocol being "http" for certain functionality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^\/\//, 'ftp://');
```
This would result in different behavior because the protocol of the base URL would be changed from "http" to "ftp". This could potentially cause issues if the code relies on the protocol being "http" for certain functionality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^\/\//, 'file://');
```
This would result in different behavior because the protocol of the base URL would be changed from "http" to "file". This could potentially cause issues if the code relies on the protocol being "http" for certain functionality.

DONE.
