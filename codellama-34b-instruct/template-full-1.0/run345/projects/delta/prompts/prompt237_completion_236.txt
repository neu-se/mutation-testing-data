  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the operation would always return a length of 0, causing the delta to never be concatenated with the rest of the document.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the operation would always return a length of Infinity, causing the delta to always be concatenated with the rest of the document, regardless of whether it was intended to be included.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the operation would always return a length of -1, causing the delta to never be concatenated with the rest of the document, regardless of whether it was intended to be included.

DONE.
