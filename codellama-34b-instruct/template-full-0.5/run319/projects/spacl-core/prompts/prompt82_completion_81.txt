  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `matches` method would always return `false` when the `ctx` argument is `null`, even if the `path` argument matches one of the `rules`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `matches` method would always return `false` when the `ctx` argument is `undefined`, even if the `path` argument matches one of the `rules`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `matches` method would always return `false` when the `ctx` argument is an empty object, even if the `path` argument matches one of the `rules`.

DONE.
