  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the strict equality operator `===` which checks for both value and type equality, while the new code fragment uses the abstract equality operator `==` which only checks for value equality. This means that the new code fragment would return `true` for `b` being `0` or `false`, while the original code fragment would only return `true` for `b` being `0`.
