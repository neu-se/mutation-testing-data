  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the number of arguments is greater than 2, while this code fragment checks if the number of arguments is greater than 1. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length < 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the number of arguments is greater than 2, while this code fragment checks if the number of arguments is less than 2. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length === 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the number of arguments is greater than 2, while this code fragment checks if the number of arguments is equal to 2. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

DONE.
