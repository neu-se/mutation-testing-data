 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrl.protocol == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the protocol is null instead of checking if it is not truthy. This might pass for cases where the protocol is an empty string, which should not be allowed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrl.url === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for strict equality with null, while the original code checks if the url property is null, undefined, or an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrl.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the pathname property instead of the entire URL. This would not be equivalent to the original code's behavior, which returns the entire URL.

DONE.
