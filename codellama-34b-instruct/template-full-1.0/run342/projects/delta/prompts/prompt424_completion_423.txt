  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType !== 'insert' || (offset < index && priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the next type is `insert`, but this code checks if it is not `insert`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset > index || !priority
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the offset is less than the index, but this code checks if it is greater than the index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!offset || priority
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the offset is less than the index, but this code checks if the offset is zero or not.

DONE.
