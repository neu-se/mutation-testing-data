  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns the values of an object, whereas `Object.keys` returns the keys of an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries` returns an array of key-value pairs, whereas `Object.keys` returns an array of keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.getOwnPropertyNames
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.getOwnPropertyNames` returns an array of all property names, including non-enumerable ones, whereas `Object.keys` returns an array of only enumerable property names.

DONE.
