  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `stackLine.includes` is a different method from `stackLine.indexOf` and would treat the search string as a substring instead of an exact match.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.lastIndexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `stackLine.lastIndexOf` returns the last occurrence of the search string instead of the first one, which could lead to different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.substr
```
This would result in different behavior because `stackLine.substr` returns a subset of a string, which could lead to unexpected results if the search string is not exactly the same as the substring.

DONE.
