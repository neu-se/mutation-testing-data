 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
spec.startsWith('/') === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `startsWith` method instead of the `match` method with a regular expression. This change would cause the error to be thrown when the spec does not start with a slash but has a valid character immediately after, whereas the original code fragment only checks for a slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
!spec.match(/^\//)
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the result of the `match` method, causing the error to be thrown when the spec does start with a slash. This is the opposite behavior of the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
/^\//.test(spec) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `test` method of a regular expression instead of the `match` method on the spec string. This change would
