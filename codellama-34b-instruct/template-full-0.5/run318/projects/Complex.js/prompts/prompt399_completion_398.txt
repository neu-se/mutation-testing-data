  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['acosh']
```
This would result in different behavior because `acosh` is the inverse hyperbolic cosine function, while `acos` is the inverse cosine function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['asin']
```
This would result in different behavior because `asin` is the inverse sine function, while `acos` is the inverse cosine function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['atan']
```
This would result in different behavior because `atan` is the inverse tangent function, while `acos` is the inverse cosine function.

DONE.
