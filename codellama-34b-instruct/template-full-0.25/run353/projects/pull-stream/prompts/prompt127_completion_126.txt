  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i--)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb(null, i++)` increments the `i` variable, while this new code fragment decrements it. This change would cause the function to return a different value for the `i` variable, which could potentially cause issues in the code that uses this function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb(null, i++)` increments the `i` variable, while this new code fragment adds 1 to the `i` variable. This change would cause the function to return a different value for the `i` variable, which could potentially cause issues in the code that uses this function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb(null, i
