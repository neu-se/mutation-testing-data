  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.nsend(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was not using the correct arguments for the `nsend` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.nsend(defer());
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was not using the correct method to create a new deferred promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.nmapply(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was not using the correct method to apply a method to a promise.

DONE.
