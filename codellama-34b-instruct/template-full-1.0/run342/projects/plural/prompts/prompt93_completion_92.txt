  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chili', 'chillis'
```
This would result in different behavior because the new fragment has an incorrect plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chilly', 'chillies'
```
This would result in different behavior because the new fragment has a different word attached to the same rule.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chill', 'chills'
```
This would result in different behavior because the new fragment has a completely different word.

DONE.
