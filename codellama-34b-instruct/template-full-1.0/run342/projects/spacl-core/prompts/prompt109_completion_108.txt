  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path + ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because '+' operator has higher precedence than ',' operator, and it would concatenate path and ctx before passing it to the matches function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy. matches(path, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the matches function on the policy object with two arguments, rather than one, which would result in a TypeError since the matches function only takes one argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, ctx, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass three arguments to the matches function, which would result in a TypeError since the matches function only takes one argument.

DONE.
