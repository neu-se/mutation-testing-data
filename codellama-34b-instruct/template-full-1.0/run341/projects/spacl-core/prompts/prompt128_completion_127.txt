  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index >= count
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to execute an extra iteration, potentially leading to unintended consequences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to never execute, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > count
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to never execute, potentially leading to unexpected results.

DONE.
