Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the `next` method to always return a single character or unit from the operation, regardless of the actual length of the operation, potentially leading to incorrect handling of operations that require more than one unit.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `next` method to return an operation with zero length, which may not be valid and could lead to unexpected results when processing operations that require a non-zero length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to read one more unit than is available in the operation, which could lead to an out-of-bounds error or incorrect operation handling, as it would exceed the actual length of the operation.

DONE.
