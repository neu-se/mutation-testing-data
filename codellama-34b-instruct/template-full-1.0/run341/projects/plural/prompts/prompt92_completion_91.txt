  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chili'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not be in the plural form, which would make the test fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chillis'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a different form of the word "chillis" than the original test, which could cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chili\n'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include a newline character, which is not present in the original test, which could cause the test to fail.

DONE.
