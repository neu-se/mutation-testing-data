  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.domain === undefined
```
This code fragment checks if the `process.domain` property is undefined, which is the opposite of the original code fragment. If the `process.domain` property is undefined, the `onUnhandledError` function will not be bound to the current domain, and any errors that are not handled will be thrown as exceptions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.domain !== null
```
This code fragment checks if the `process.domain` property is not null, which is the opposite of the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.domain !== undefined && process.domain !== null
```
This code fragment checks if the `process.domain` property is not undefined and not null, which is
