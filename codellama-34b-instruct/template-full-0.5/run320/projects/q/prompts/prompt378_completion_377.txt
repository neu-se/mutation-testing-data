  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then(function(){})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with an undefined value, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then(function(){ return null; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with a null value, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then(function(){ throw new Error(); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with an error, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
