  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0 >= d
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for equality with 0, while this replacement checks for greater than or equal to 0. This would cause the code to behave differently for negative values of d.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for equality with 0, while this replacement checks for strict equality with 0. This would cause the code to behave differently for values of d that are not exactly 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for equality with 0, while this replacement checks for inequality with 0. This would cause the code to behave differently for values of d that are not equal to 0.

DONE.
