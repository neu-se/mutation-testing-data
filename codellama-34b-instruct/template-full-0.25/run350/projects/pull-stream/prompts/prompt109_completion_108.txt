  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = reducer(acc, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reducer` function is not being called with the correct arguments. The `reducer` function expects two arguments, but in this case, it is being called with one argument, `acc`, which is not the correct usage of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = reducer(data, acc)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reducer` function is being called with the arguments in the reverse order of what is expected. The `reducer` function expects the first argument to be the accumulator, and the second argument to be the data, but in this case, the arguments are reversed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = reducer(acc, data, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reducer` function is being called with an extra argument, `null`, which is not expected. The `
