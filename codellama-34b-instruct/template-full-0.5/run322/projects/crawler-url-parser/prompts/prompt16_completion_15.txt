  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes a fragment identifier from the URL, while the new code fragment would replace the fragment identifier with a '#' character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#' + Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes a fragment identifier from the URL, while the new code fragment would replace the fragment identifier with a random string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#' + Date.now()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes a fragment identifier from the URL, while the new code fragment would replace the fragment identifier with the current timestamp.

DONE.
