  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeTimezone(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always memoize a null timezone, regardless of whether the timezone exists or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeTimezone(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always memoize an undefined timezone, regardless of whether the timezone exists or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeTimezone(timezones[name]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always memoize the timezone with the same name, regardless of whether the timezone exists or not.

DONE.
