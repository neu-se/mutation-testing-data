 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fileNameAndLineNumber === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison checks for nullity, which is more strict than the original check for falsy values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof fileNameAndLineNumber === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for undefined, which is a specific falsy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!Array.isArray(fileNameAndLineNumber)
