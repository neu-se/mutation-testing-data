 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the object to a string before passing it to the `values` function, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because it gets the values of the object directly, instead of getting the keys and then passing them to the `values` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a random number instead of the object, which would likely cause the test to fail.

DONE.
