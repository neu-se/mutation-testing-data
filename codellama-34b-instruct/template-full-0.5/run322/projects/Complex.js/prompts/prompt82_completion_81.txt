  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === 'j' || c === 'J'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is checking for the letter 'j' or 'J' instead of 'i' or 'I'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === 'I' || c === 'i'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is checking for the letter 'I' or 'i' instead of 'i' or 'I'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
