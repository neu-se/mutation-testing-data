 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
180/Math.PI*θ
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly multiplies θ with a constant value instead of using the `rad2deg` function, which could lead to incorrect degree conversions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan2(y, x) * 180 / Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the order of operations for calculating the longitude value, which could lead to incorrect longitude values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.asin(sinφ1 * cosδ + cosφ1 * sinδ * cosθ) * 180 / Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly calculates the latitude value using `asin` instead of using the `GeoPoint.fromLatLngArray` method, which could lead to incorrect latitude values.
