  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because `abortCb` is a function that takes three arguments, but in the original code, it is being called with only two arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `abortCb` is being called with an additional `null` argument, which may cause it to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `abortCb` is being called with an additional `undefined` argument, which may cause it to behave differently.

DONE.
