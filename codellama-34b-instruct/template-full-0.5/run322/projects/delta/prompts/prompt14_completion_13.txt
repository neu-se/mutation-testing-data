  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(attributes).length
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys(attributes).length` returns the number of keys in the `attributes` object, while `attributes` returns the object itself. This change would cause the function to return a different value, potentially causing the test suite to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(attributes).length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys(attributes).length > 1` checks if the number of keys in the `attributes` object is greater than 1, while `attributes` returns the object itself. This change would cause the function to return a different value, potentially causing the test suite to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(attributes).length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys(attributes).length === 0` checks if the number of keys in the `attributes` object is
