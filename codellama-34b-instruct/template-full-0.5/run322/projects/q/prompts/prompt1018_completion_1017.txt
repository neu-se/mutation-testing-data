  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is used to reject the promise, while `deferred.resolve` is used to resolve it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is a function, while `undefined` is not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is a function, while `null` is a primitive value.

DONE.
