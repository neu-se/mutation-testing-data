  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI + x
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a fixed and well-known value, whereas `x` is a variable that could take on any value. The expression `Math.PI + x` would be much more unlikely to produce a result close to the expected value, making it more likely to detect a buggy implementation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.E + x
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.E` is a fixed and well-known value, whereas `x` is a variable that could take on any value. The expression `Math.E + x` would be much more unlikely to produce a result close to the expected value, making it more likely to detect a buggy implementation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt(x)` would produce a result that is always positive, whereas `x
