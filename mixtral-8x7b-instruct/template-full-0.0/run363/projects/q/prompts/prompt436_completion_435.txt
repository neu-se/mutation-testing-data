 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.includes(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype.includes` is a modern method not available in older environments without polyfills, and it may not work as expected with non-object values like `null` or `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
~array_indexOf(unhandledRejections, promise)
