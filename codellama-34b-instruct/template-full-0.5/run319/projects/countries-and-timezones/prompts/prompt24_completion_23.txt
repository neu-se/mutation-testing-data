  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
utcOffset + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the offset would be increased by 1, which could affect the resulting UTC offset string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dstOffset
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting UTC offset string would be based on the DST offset instead of the UTC offset.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(utcOffset + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting UTC offset string would be based on the offset plus 1, which could affect the resulting UTC offset string.

DONE.
