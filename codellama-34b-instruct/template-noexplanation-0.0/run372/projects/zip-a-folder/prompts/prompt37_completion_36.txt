  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isGlob(src)
```
This code fragment has different behavior than the original code fragment because it negates the result of the `isGlob` function, which means that if the `src` variable is a glob, the code will enter the `else` block instead of the `if` block.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(src) && false
```
This code fragment has different behavior than the original code fragment because it adds an additional condition to the `if` statement, which means that the code will always enter the `else` block regardless of the value of the `src` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(src) || true
```
This code fragment has different behavior than the original code fragment because it adds an additional condition to the `if` statement, which means that the code will always enter the `if` block regardless of the value of the `src` variable.

DONE.
