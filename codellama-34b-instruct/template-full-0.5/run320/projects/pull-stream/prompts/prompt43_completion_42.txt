  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref.slice()` returns a shallow copy of the `ref` array, while `ref` returns the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref.length` returns the length of the `ref` array, while `ref` returns the array itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref.pop()` removes the last element from the `ref` array and returns it, while `ref` returns the array itself.

DONE.
