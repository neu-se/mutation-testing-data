  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href', 'http://example.com')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the `href` attribute of the current element to point to a different URL, which could potentially break the functionality of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href', 'javascript:void(0)')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the `href` attribute of the current element to point to a JavaScript code snippet that does nothing, which could potentially break the functionality of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href', 'http://example.com')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the `href` attribute of the current element to point to a different URL, which could potentially break the functionality of the code.

DONE.
