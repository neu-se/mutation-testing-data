  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPromise` function would return `false` for `null`, causing the `nearer` function to return `value` instead of `inspected.value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPromise` function would return `false` for `undefined`, causing the `nearer` function to return `value` instead of `inspected.value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPromise` function would return `false` for `0`, causing the `nearer` function to return `value` instead of `inspected.value`.

DONE.
