  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve` creates a resolved promise, whereas `Promise.reject` creates a rejected promise. In this case, the function would return a resolved promise instead of a rejected promise, which could cause the function to behave differently than expected.

DONE.
