Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly checks the type of the current operation in `thisIter` instead of `otherIter`, potentially leading to incorrect transformations when merging operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the length of the next operation in `otherIter` instead of its type, which could cause the logic to incorrectly handle the operations based on their lengths rather than their types.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it compares the type of the next operation in `otherIter` to 'delete' directly, which would not invoke the method to get the type, leading to a potential type mismatch and incorrect handling of operations.

DONE.
