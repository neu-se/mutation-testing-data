Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the `next` method to always consume one unit, potentially skipping over necessary operations that should be processed, leading to incorrect composition of the `Delta`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it effectively does nothing, as it attempts to consume zero units, which means the current operation will not be advanced, potentially causing an infinite loop or incorrect results in the composition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses the `otherIter` iterator to consume an operation from the `other` Delta instead of the current `thisIter`, leading to a mismatch in the operations being composed and potentially corrupting the resulting `Delta`.

DONE.
