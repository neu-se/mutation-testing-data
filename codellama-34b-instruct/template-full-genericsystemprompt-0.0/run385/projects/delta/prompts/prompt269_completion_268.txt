  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a method that deletes a specified number of characters from the delta, while `chop` is a method that removes any trailing retain ops with an attribute of zero length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` is a method that retains a specified number of characters from the delta, while `chop` is a method that removes any trailing retain ops with an attribute of zero length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` is a method that concatenates two deltas, while `chop` is a method that removes any trailing retain ops with an attribute of zero length.

DONE.
