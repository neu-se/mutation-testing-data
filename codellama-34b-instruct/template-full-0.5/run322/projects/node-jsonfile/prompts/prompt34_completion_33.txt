  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file + '.' + options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `file` is a string, and adding a string and an object property `options.encoding` would result in a concatenated string, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.encoding + file
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `file` is a string, and adding an object property `options.encoding` and a string would result in a concatenated string, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.substring(0, options.encoding.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `file` is a string, and calling the `substring` method with a start index of 0 and an end index of the length of `options.encoding` would result in a substring of the original string, which may not be the intended behavior.
