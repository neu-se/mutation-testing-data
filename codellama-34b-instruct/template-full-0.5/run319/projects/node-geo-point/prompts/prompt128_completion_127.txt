  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.calculateDistance(point, this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, which would cause the calculation to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.calculateDistance(this, point) + 100
```
This would result in different behavior because an additional 100 meters is added to the calculated distance, which would affect the result of the `calculateDistance` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.calculateDistance(this, point) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculated distance is multiplied by 2, which would affect the result of the `calculateDistance` method.

DONE.
