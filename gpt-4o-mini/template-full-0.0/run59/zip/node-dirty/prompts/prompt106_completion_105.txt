Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the value by adding 1, which could lead to incorrect data being stored in the cache instead of the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the value to `null`, which would cause the application to treat the key as having no value, potentially leading to unexpected behavior when retrieving this key later.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get('nonExistentKey')
```
This would result in different behavior because it retrieves a value from a different key that does not exist, which would likely return `undefined` instead of the intended value from the `row` object.

DONE.
