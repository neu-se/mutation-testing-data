 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
flatten(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it forcibly sets the final flag to true, which may not be desired in all cases. The original code only sets the final flag to true when explicitly called with the argument, allowing more flexibility.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
parts.push('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an empty string to the parts array, which can alter the final regular expression. The original code does not add any empty strings to the parts array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
flatten(); return ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the final function to return an empty string, which is not the original behavior. The original code returns the final regular expression as a string.

DONE.
