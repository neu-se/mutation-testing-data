 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/.*@(.+):(\d+)\s*$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an optional trailing space before the end-of-line anchor, which could affect the matching of stack traces that have trailing spaces.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/.*@(.+):(\d+);?$/.exec
