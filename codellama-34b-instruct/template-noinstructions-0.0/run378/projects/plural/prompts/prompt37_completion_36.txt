  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/appendix|index/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ices' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only applies the rule to words that end in "ix", while this new code fragment applies it to words that end in "ix" or "ex".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/appendix|index/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'es' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds "ices" to words that end in "ix", while this new code fragment adds "es" to words that end in "ix" or "ex".

addRule(/appendix|index/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + '
