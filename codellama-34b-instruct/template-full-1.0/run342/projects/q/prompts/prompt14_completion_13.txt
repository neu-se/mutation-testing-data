  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.fail
```
This would result in different behavior because `ses.fail` is a different function that may return a different value than `ses.ok`, which could cause the conditional statement to evaluate differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the conditional statement would evaluate to `false` instead of `true`, which could cause the code to take a different branch or perform a different action.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a special value in JavaScript that represents "Not a Number", and it may cause the conditional statement to evaluate differently or produce a different result.

DONE.
