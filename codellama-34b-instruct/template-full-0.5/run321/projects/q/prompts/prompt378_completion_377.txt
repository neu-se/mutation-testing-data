  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `tap` is a method that returns the input promise, while `then` is a method that returns a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then(function() { return promise; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `tap` is a method that returns the input promise, while `then` is a method that returns a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the callback. In this case, the callback returns the input promise, which would result in the same behavior as `tap`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then(function() { return Q(promise); })
```
This would result in different behavior because `tap` is a method that returns the input promise, while `then` is a method that returns a new promise that is resolved with
