  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT, which means that the resulting value will be the opposite of the original value. In this case, if `end` is `true`, the resulting value will be `false`, and if `end` is `false`, the resulting value will be `true`. This change in behavior could potentially cause the `map` function to behave differently than expected, especially if it relies on the value of `end` to determine its behavior.

DONE.
