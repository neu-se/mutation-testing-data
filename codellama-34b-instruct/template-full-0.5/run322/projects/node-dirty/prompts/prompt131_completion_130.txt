  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data` is an object, while `this._queue` is a map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._queue.values()` returns an iterator over the values in the map, while `this._queue` returns the map itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.entries()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._queue.entries()` returns an iterator over the key-value pairs in the map, while `this._queue` returns the map itself.

DONE.
