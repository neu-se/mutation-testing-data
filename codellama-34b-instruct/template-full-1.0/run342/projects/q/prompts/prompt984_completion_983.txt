  DONE. I have generated three options for a broken code fragment: 

Option 1:  The placeholder can be replaced with: deferred.
This would result in different behavior because it would omit the resolve and reject method calls.

Option 2:  The placeholder can be replaced with:rejected.
This would result in different behavior because it would call the reject method without a reason argument.

Option 3:  The placeholder can be replaced with: deferred.reject(undefined)
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with an undefined reason.
