Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the presence of an insert operation instead of a delete operation, which would lead to incorrect handling of the operation when inverting, potentially causing data loss or corruption.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the retain property is undefined instead of checking for a delete operation, which would skip over valid delete operations and incorrectly process the inversion logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the length of the operation is greater than zero instead of checking for a delete operation, which could lead to incorrect assumptions about the operation's nature and result in improper handling of the inversion.

DONE.
