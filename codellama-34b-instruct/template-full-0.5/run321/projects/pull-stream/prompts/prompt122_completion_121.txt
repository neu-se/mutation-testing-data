  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `source` is an object that has a `source` method, but `null` is not an object and does not have a `source` method. This would cause the code to throw an error when trying to call the `source` method on `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `source` is an object that has a `source` method, but `undefined` is not an object and does not have a `source` method. This would cause the code to throw an error when trying to call the `source` method on `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `source` is an object that has a `source` method, but `{}` is an empty object that does not have a `source` method. This would cause the code to
