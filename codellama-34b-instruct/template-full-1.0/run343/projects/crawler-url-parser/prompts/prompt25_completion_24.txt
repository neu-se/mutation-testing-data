  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"#"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `''` empty string, which removes any existing fragment from the URL, while `"#"` would leave the existing fragment in place.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"/"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `''` empty string, which removes any existing path from the URL, while `"/"` would leave the existing path in place.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"?"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `''` empty string, which removes any existing query string from the URL, while `"?"` would leave the existing query string in place.

DONE.
