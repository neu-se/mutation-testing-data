  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.sin` function returns the sine of a number, while `Math.cos` returns the cosine. The `Math.sin` function is used in the `sin` method of the `Complex` class to calculate the sine of a complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.cosh` function returns the hyperbolic cosine of a number, while `Math.cos` returns the cosine. The `Math.cosh` function is used in the `cos` method of the `Complex` class to calculate the cosine of a complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tanh
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.tanh` function returns the hyperbolic tangent of a number, while `Math.cos` returns the cosine
