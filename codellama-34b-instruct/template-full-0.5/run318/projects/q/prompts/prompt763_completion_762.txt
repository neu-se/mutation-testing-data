  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `array_map` function to return an array of zeros instead of an array of promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises, Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `array_map` function to return an array of rejected promises instead of an array of resolved promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `array_map` function to return an array of null values instead of an array of promises.

DONE.
