  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the `other` iterator instead of the `this` iterator, potentially altering the outcome of the `concat()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.reverseOps
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the operations in the delta, potentially causing the wrong operations to be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `concat()` method to return a null delta, when it should return a new delta with the concatenated operations.

DONE.
