  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rest
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.rest` is a different method that returns a different value than `this.next`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.next - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.next - 1` would cause the method to return the previous element in the array, rather than the next one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.next + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.next + 1` would cause the method to return the next element in the array, rather than the current one.

DONE.
