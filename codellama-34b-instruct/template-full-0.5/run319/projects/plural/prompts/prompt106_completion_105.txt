  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/^\b(?:wo)?man\b/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'e') })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression used in the original code fragment is `/^(?:wo)?man$/i`, which matches "man" or "woman" at the beginning of a string, but the new code fragment uses `/^\b(?:wo)?man\b/i`, which matches "man" or "woman" at the beginning of a word.
