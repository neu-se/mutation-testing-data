  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if the number of in-flight writes is less than or equal to zero, while the modified code is checking if it is less than zero. If the number of in-flight writes is greater than zero, the modified code would not enter the if block, while the original code would.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if the number of in-flight writes is less than or equal to zero, while the modified code is checking if it is greater than zero. If the number of in-flight writes is less than zero, the modified code would enter the if block, while the original code would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites += 1
```
This would result in different
