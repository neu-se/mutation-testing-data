 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved instead of rejected, which changes the expected behavior of the code when an error occurs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the progress of the promise would be updated instead of rejecting it, which might not trigger error handling code that expects a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { throw new Error('Buggy replacement'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because an error would be thrown, which might not be handled correctly by the test suite and could expose issues in error handling code.

DONE.
