  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.split
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is used to find a match in a string, while `split` is used to split a string into an array of substrings based on a separator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is used to find a match in a string, while `indexOf` is used to find the index of a substring within a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is used to find a match in a string, while `includes` is used to check if a string contains a substring.

DONE.
