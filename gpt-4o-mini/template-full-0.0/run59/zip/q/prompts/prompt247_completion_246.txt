Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.slice(0, e.stack.indexOf("\n") + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the way the stack trace is extracted, potentially including only the first line of the stack instead of the entire stack trace, which could lead to incomplete debugging information.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.split("\n")[0];
```
This would result in different behavior because it retrieves only the first line of the stack trace, discarding all subsequent lines, which may omit crucial context needed for debugging.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.substring(e.stack.indexOf("\n") + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it omits the first line of the stack trace entirely, which may lead to a loss of important information about where the error originated, affecting the ability to trace back the error effectively.

DONE.
