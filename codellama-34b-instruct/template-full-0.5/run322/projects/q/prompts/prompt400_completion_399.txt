  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Q.thenResolve` method to return a promise that is already resolved with the value `null`, rather than a promise that is resolved with the value of the `promise` parameter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Q.thenResolve` method to return a promise that is already resolved with the value `undefined`, rather than a promise that is resolved with the value of the `promise` parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Q.thenResolve` method to return a promise that is already resolved with the value `0`, rather than a promise that is resolved with the value of the `promise` parameter.

DONE.
