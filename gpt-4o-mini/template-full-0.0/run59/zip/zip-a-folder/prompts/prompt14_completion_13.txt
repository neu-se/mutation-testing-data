Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks only for write permissions instead of read permissions, which could allow access to a directory that is writable but not readable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.R_OK | fs.constants.W_OK | fs.constants.X_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for read, write, and execute permissions, which may lead to a situation where the code incorrectly assumes access is granted if only one of those permissions is available.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.F_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks only for the existence of the file or directory, not for read permissions, which could lead to a false positive if the directory exists but is not accessible for reading.

DONE.
