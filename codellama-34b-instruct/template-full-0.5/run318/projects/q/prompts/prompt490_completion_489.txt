```
rejected && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` variable would always be `false` in this case, even if the promise is actually rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` variable would be negated, causing the `trackRejection` function to be called even if the promise is actually fulfilled. This would cause the `
