  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is less than 0, while this new code fragment checks if `b` is greater than 0. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` when `b` is negative, which would result in a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b != 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is less than 0, while this new code fragment checks if `b` is not equal to 0. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `b` is negative, which would result in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is less than 0, while this new code fragment checks if `b` is equal to
