  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"handledRejection", reason, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process.emit()` method would not be called with the expected event type, which could cause issues if other code is relying on the `unhandledRejection` event to function correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejection", reason, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process.emit()` method would not be called with the expected event type, which could cause issues if other code is relying on the `unhandledRejection` event to function correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection", reason, promise, 1000
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process.emit()` method would be called with an additional argument, which could cause issues if the code is not expecting an extra argument and could cause unpredictable behavior.

DONE.
