Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof url === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the original condition, potentially allowing non-string inputs to bypass the subsequent checks.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
url === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for a specific value (`null`) instead of a type, which could lead to different handling of `null` versus other non-string values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof url!== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for a different type (`object`) and uses a different operator (`!==`), which could affect how the function handles inputs like arrays or other non-string, non-object values.

DONE.
