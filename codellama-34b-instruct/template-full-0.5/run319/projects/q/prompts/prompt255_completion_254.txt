  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise, message[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `message[0]` is a different value than `message`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise, message.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `message.slice(1)` is a different value than `message`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise, message.concat(newPromise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `message.concat(newPromise)` is a different value than `message`.

DONE.
