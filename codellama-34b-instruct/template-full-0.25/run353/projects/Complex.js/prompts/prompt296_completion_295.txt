  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function is being applied to `b` instead of `a`, which would change the resulting value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function is being applied to the sum of `a` and `b` instead of just `a`, which would change the resulting value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function is being applied to the product of `a` and `b` instead of just `a`, which would change the resulting value.

DONE.
