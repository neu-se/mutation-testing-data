  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the result of the `isEqual` function, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNotEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNotEqual` function is not defined in the code snippet, and would cause a `ReferenceError` to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isEqual(otherOp.insert, thisOp.insert)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isEqual` function would be called with the arguments in the opposite order than in the original code, which could cause the function to return a different result.

DONE.
