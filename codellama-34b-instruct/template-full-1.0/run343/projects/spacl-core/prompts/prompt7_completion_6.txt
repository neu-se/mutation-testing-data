  Sure, I can help you with that!

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\//) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex would now match a single forward slash, rather than two forward slashes as the original code does. This means that the Matcher would allow paths with a single forward slash, which may not be desirable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(new RegExp('//')) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now declared as a RegExp object, rather than a string literal. This could result in different behavior if the Matcher is using the RegExp object in a way that is not intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^/$/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression now matches the start and end of the string, rather than any occurrence of two forward slashes. This would mean that the Matcher would only allow paths
