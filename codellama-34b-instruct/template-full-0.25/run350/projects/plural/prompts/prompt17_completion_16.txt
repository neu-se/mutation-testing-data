  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag is added, which makes the regular expression match all occurrences in the string, not just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag is added, which makes the regular expression case-insensitive, so it would match "X" as well as "x".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now a simple string, not a regular expression object.

DONE.
