  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `ends.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `ends.resolve` would cause the promise to be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `closed.resolve` would cause the `closed` promise to be resolved, whereas `ends.resolve` would cause the `ends` promise to be resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `next.reject` would cause the `next` promise to be rejected, whereas `ends.resolve` would cause the `ends` promise to be resolved.

DONE.
