  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function has a different output than the `cos` function, which is used in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(x+1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function is now being called with a different argument, which would change the output of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.random()` function returns a random number between 0 and 1, which would change the output of the `cos` function.

DONE.
