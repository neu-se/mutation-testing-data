  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `onAbort` is a reference to a function, while `onAbort()` is a function call, which would result in the function being executed immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `onAbort` is a reference to a function, while `onAbort.bind(this)` is a bound function, which would result in the function being bound to a different context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `onAbort` is a reference to a function, while `onAbort.call(this)` is a function call with a specific context, which would result in the function being executed in a different context.

DONE.
