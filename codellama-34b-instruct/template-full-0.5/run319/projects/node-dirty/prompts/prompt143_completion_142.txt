  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error('Custom error message')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment emits an error event with the original error object, while this code fragment emits an error event with a new error object with a custom error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment emits an error event with the original error object, while this code fragment emits an error event with a null error object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', 'custom error message'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment emits an error event with the original error object, while this code fragment emits an error event with a string error message.

DONE.
