  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject, op, args
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected, even if the function succeeded.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify, op, args
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be in the pending state, even if the function ran to completion.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, op, args
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument to `dispatch` would be `null`, which would result in an error.

DONE.
