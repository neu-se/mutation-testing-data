  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the result of the `cosh` function, which is used in the `tanh` and `coth` functions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the result of the `cosh` function, which is used in the `tanh` and `coth` functions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the result of the `cosh` function, which is used in the `tanh` and `coth` functions.

DONE.
