  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
drain(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `drain` is a function that takes two arguments, but the mutated code fragment `drain(null)` only passes one argument, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
drain(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `drain` is a function that takes two arguments, but the mutated code fragment `drain(undefined)` passes `undefined` as the second argument, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
drain(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `drain` is a function that takes two arguments, but the mutated code fragment `drain(false)` passes `false` as the second argument, which could cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
