  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` operator is used to remove a property from an object, whereas the `set` operator is used to set a property on an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` operator is used to retrieve the value of a property, whereas the `set` operator is used to set a property on an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method is a method defined on the `Promise` prototype that is used to invoke a method on the resolved value of the promise, whereas the `set` method is a method defined on the `Promise` prototype that is used to set a property on the resolved value of the promise.

DONE.
