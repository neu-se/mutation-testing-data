  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp.delete === 'number' && newOp.insert != null
```
This code fragment is equivalent to the original code fragment and will have the same behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp.delete === 'number' && newOp.insert === null
```
This code fragment is the opposite of the original code fragment and will have different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp.delete === 'number' && newOp.insert === undefined
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code fragment but will have different behavior when `newOp.insert` is `undefined`.

DONE.
