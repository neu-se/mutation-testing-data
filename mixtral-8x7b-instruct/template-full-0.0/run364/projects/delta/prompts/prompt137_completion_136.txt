 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
firstOther?.retain !== undefined && firstOther.attributes === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `firstOther.retain` is not `undefined` instead of checking if it is a number. It also checks if `firstOther.attributes` is exactly `null` instead of just being falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
firstOther !== null && firstOther.hasOwnProperty('retain') && firstOther.attributes === undefined
