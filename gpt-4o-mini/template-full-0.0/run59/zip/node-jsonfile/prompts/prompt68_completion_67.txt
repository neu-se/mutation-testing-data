Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\uFEFF/g, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of the `g` (global) flag would cause all occurrences of the BOM character to be removed, rather than just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\u2022/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces a bullet character (U+2022) instead of the BOM character (U+FEFF), which would not remove the BOM from the content.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\uFEFF/, ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the BOM character with a space instead of removing it, potentially altering the content in an unintended way.

DONE.
