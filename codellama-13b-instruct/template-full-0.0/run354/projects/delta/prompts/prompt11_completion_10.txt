  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const key in b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key` variable is now referring to the `b` object instead of the `a` object. This would cause the `compose` function to return a different result, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the code that uses this function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const key in a && b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key` variable is now referring to the intersection of the `a` and `b` objects. This would cause the `compose` function to return a different result, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the code that uses this function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const key in a || b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key` variable is now referring to the union of the `a` and `b` objects. This would cause the `compose` function to return a different result, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the code that uses this
