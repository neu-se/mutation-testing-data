Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the entire `baseUrlStr` to uppercase, which may lead to incorrect URL parsing and resolution, as URLs are case-sensitive in certain contexts.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/#.*$/, 'http://example.com')
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the fragment identifier with a hardcoded URL, which would change the intended base URL and potentially lead to incorrect URL resolutions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/#.*$/, '').replace('http:', 'ftp:')
```
This would result in different behavior because it not only removes the fragment but also changes the protocol from `http:` to `ftp:`, which could lead to invalid URL parsing and resolution since the original protocol is altered.

DONE.
