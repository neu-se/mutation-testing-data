  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDestination` method would calculate the destination point with an incorrect distance value, leading to a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDestination` method would calculate the destination point with an incorrect distance value, leading to a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDestination` method would calculate the destination point with an incorrect distance value, leading to a different result.

DONE.
