 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` value will always be falsy, which might not be the intended behavior in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 + op
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the type of `op` to a number, which might not be expected in the original code. This could lead to unexpected results if the rest of the code relies on the original type of `op`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
op.toUpperCase
