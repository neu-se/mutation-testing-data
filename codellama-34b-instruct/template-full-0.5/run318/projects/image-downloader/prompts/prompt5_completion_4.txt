  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject` throws an error, while `Promise.resolve` returns a resolved promise with no arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject('Error message')
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject` throws an error with a specific message, while `Promise.reject` throws an error with a different message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(new Error('Error message'))
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject` throws an error with a specific message and a stack trace, while `Promise.reject` throws an error with a different message and a different stack trace.

DONE.
