  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `callback.apply` would still be a function even if `callback` is null, while the original code fragment would evaluate to `true` if `callback` is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback !== void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a special value that represents the absence of a value, while `null` is a value that represents the absence of an object reference. The original code fragment would evaluate to `true` if `callback` is `null`, while this replacement would evaluate to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof callback !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also evaluate to `true` if `callback` is not a function, while the original code fragment would only evaluate to `true` if `callback` is null or undefined.

DONE.
