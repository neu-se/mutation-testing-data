  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(s)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the expression, causing the value of `s` to be inverted. If `s` is truthy, it will become falsy after the negation, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator performs addition, causing the value of `s` to be increased by 1. If `s` is a number, this will change its value, and if it is a string, it will concatenate a `1` to the end of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
++s
```
This would result in different behavior because the `++` operator increments the value of `s` by 1. If `s` is a number, it will be increased by 1, and if it is a string, it will be concatenated with a `
