  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always push the new operation to the end of the ops array, regardless of whether it can be merged with the previous operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always push the new operation to the beginning of the ops array, regardless of whether it can be merged with the previous operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(Math.random() * this.ops.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would randomly push the new operation to any position in the ops array, regardless of whether it can be merged with the previous operation.

DONE.
