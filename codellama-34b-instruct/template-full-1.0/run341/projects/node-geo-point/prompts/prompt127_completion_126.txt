  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `point` would return a `GeoPoint` object, but replacing it with `undefined` would cause the function to return `undefined` instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `point` would return a `GeoPoint` object, but replacing it with `null` would cause the function to return `null` instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new GeoPoint(0, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `point` would return a `GeoPoint` object with the same latitude and longitude as the current instance, but replacing it with `new GeoPoint(0, 0)` would cause the function to return a new `GeoPoint` object with latitude and longitude both equal to 0, instead of the current instance's latitude and longitude.
