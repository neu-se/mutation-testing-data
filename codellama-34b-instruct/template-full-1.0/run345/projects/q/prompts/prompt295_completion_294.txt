  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.reject()` method should always be called with a reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.reject()` method should always be called with a reason, not a random number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.reject()` method should always be called with a reason, not a function.

DONE.
