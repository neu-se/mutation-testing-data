  Sounds great! I'm excited to help you with this exercise. Here are three possible code fragments that could be used as replacements for the PLACEHOLDER and their corresponding brief explanations:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
11, places || 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the operator is changed from `Math.pow()` to `Math.sqrt()`, which will return a different value for `places`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10, places * 2 || 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `Math.pow()` is changed from `places` to `places * 2`, which will return a different value for `places`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10, places || Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `Math.pow()` is changed from `0` to `Math.PI`, which will return a different value for `
