  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Empty lines are OK in a healthy database')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, and the code that handles errors may behave differently based on the error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Validating...')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, and the code that handles errors may behave differently based on the error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, and the code that handles errors may behave differently based on the error message.

DONE.
