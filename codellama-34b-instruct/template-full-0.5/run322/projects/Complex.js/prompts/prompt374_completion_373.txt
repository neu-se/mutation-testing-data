  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the `d` variable, which is used in the calculation of the `x` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the `d` variable, which is used in the calculation of the `x` variable. Additionally, it would change the value of the `oneMinus` variable, which is used in the calculation of the `x` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the `d` variable, which is used in the calculation of the `x` variable. Additionally, it would change the value of the `onePlus` variable, which is used in the calculation of the `x` variable.

DONE.
