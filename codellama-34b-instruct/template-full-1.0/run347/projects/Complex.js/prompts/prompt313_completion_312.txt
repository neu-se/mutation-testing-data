  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```python
sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinh` operates on the imaginary part of the complex number, instead of the real part as `cosh` does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```python
atan2(im, re)
```
This would result in different behavior because `atan2` takes two arguments and calculates the arctangent of `im/re`, whereas `cosh` only takes a single argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```python
cot
```
This would result in different behavior because `cot` calculates the cotangent of the complex number, which is the reciprocal of `tan`, whereas `cosh` calculates the hyperbolic cosine.

DONE.
