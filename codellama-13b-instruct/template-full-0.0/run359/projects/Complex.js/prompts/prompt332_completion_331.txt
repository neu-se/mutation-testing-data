  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan` function would return `NaN` when `b === 0`, which would cause the `acot` function to return `NaN` as well.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan` function would return `NaN` when `a === 0`, which would cause the `acot` function to return `NaN` as well.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 && b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan` function would return `NaN` when `a === 0 && b === 0`, which would cause the `acot` function to return `NaN` as well.

DONE.
