 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.keys(a)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the keys of the first operand `a` instead of the second operand `b`. This could lead to incorrect embed type detection if the keys of the operands don't match.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'nonexistent_embed_type' as const
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a nonexistent embed type, which would cause the `getHandler` method to throw an error. This could expose issues with error handling or missing embed type registrations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Math.random() as string
```
This would result in different behavior because it generates a random string as the embed type. This could expose issues with error handling or the robustness of the code when dealing with unexpected embed types.

DONE.
