  DONE.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(im, re);
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the argument of the complex number in the opposite direction.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(re, im);
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the argument of the complex number in the opposite direction.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(-im, re);
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the argument of the complex number in the opposite direction.
