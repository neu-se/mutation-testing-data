  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const key in b) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the keys of the `b` object instead of the `a` object, which could lead to different results in the `compose` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const key in a) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the keys of the `a` object instead of the `b` object, which could lead to different results in the `compose` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const key in a && b) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the keys of both the `a` and `b` objects, which could lead to different results in the `compose` function.

DONE.
