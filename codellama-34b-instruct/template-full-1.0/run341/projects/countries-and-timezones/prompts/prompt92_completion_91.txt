  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"invalidCountryId"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function would return `null` instead of the expected country object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId + "ABC"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function would return a different country object with a different ID than the expected country object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function would return a different country object with a different ID than the expected country object.

DONE.
