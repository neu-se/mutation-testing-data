  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a` variable is not defined in the current scope, so the code would throw a ReferenceError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b * b` expression would evaluate to `0`, which would cause the `sqrt` function to return `0`, which would cause the `log` function to return `NaN`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `1` constant would cause the `sqrt` function to return `1`, which would cause the `log` function to return `0`.

DONE.
