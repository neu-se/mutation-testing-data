  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"emit"
```
This would result in different behavior because "emit" is a different method on the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"that"
```
This would result in different behavior because "that" is a different variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"isRejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because "isRejected" is a different method on the object.

DONE.
