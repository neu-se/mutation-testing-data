  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method is not defined on the `Q` object, so it would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.inspect(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.inspect` is not a valid method, so it would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(function (result) { return result.inspect(); })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method is not defined on the `Q` object, so it would throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
