  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.hasNext()` always returns `true` when there are more ops to iterate over, whereas `<PLACEHOLDER>` may return `false` if the iterator is at the end of the ops.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.peekLength()` returns the length of the next op, whereas `<PLACEHOLDER>` may return a different value if the iterator is at the end of the ops.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.next()` returns the next op, whereas `<PLACEHOLDER>` may return a different value if the iterator is at the end of the ops.

DONE.
