  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criteria'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a singular noun, while the replacement code fragment is a plural noun.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterium'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a singular noun, while the replacement code fragment is a singular noun with a different spelling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterion' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a singular noun, while the replacement code fragment is a plural noun formed by adding an 's' to the end of the original word.

DONE.
