  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the first string in the array is being used instead of the second string, which would cause the diff function to return an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the third string in the array is being used instead of the second string, which would cause the diff function to return an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the fourth string in the array is being used instead of the second string, which would cause the diff function to return an incorrect result.

DONE.
