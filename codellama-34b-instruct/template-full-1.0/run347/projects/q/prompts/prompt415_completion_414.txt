  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromise()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the function always return `true`, even if the input is not a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isPromise()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the function always return `false`, even if the input is a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void(isPromise())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the function always return `undefined`, even if the input is a promise.

DONE.
