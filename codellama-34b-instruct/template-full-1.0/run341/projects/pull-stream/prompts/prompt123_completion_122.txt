  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > max - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to return a different value for `i` when `i` is equal to `max`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to return a different value for `end` when `end` is equal to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < max - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to return a different value for `i` when `i` is less than `max - 1`.

DONE.
