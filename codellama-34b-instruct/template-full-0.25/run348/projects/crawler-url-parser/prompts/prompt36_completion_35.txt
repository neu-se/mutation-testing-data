  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would not be called with the `true` value for the `parseQueryString` parameter, which would cause the query string to not be parsed and the `search` property of the returned URL object to be `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would not be called with the `undefined` value for the `parseQueryString` parameter, which would cause the query string to not be parsed and the `search` property of the returned URL object to be `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would not be called with the `null` value for the `parseQueryString` parameter, which would cause the query string to not be parsed and the `search` property of the returned URL object to be `null`.
