  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split(' ').slice
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method would split the string on spaces instead of forward slashes, leading to potentially different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/#/).slice
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match` method would return the indices of any matches, so the `slice` method would be operating on an array of numbers instead of strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').reverse().slice
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse` method would reverse the order of the arrays returned by the `split` method, leading to potentially different results.

DONE.
