```
scope.hasPendingScopes()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `scope.hasPendingScopes()` method checks if the current scope has pending child scopes, which may return a different result than checking if the `promise` object has a state of `"pending"`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.isPending()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise.isPending()` method checks if the `promise` object has a state of `"pending"`, whereas the `scope.hasPendingScopes()` method checks if the current scope has pending child scopes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!promise.isFulfilled()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!promise.isFulfilled()` method checks if the `promise` object has a state of `"rejected"`, which may return a different result than
