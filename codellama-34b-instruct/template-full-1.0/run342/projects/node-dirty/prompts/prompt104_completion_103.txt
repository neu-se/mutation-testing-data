  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(row.key, row.val);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to overwrite a value in the database with an empty string, even if the database does not contain the given key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(row.key, row.val + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to increment the value associated with a particular key in the database every time the same key appears in the file being loaded.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(row.key, Math.random());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to replace any existing value in the database with a random number, regardless of whether the key appears in the file being loaded.

DONE.
