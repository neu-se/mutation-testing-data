  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb of verbs.map(v => v.toUpperCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allow` method would now allow all uppercase verbs, while the original code would only allow the verbs that were passed in as arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb of verbs.filter(v => v !== 'GET')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allow` method would now allow all verbs except for `GET`, while the original code would allow all verbs that were passed in as arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb of verbs.reduce((acc, v) => acc + v, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allow` method would now allow all verbs concatenated together, while the original code would allow all verbs that were passed in as arguments.

DONE.
