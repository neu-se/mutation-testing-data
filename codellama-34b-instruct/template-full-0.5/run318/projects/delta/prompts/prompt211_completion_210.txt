  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(0, 10);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first 10 operations in the `ops` array, while the original code considers all operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(10, 20);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider operations 10-19 in the `ops` array, while the original code considers all operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(0, this.ops.length - 10);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the last 10 operations in the `ops` array, while the original code considers all operations.

DONE.
