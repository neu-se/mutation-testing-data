  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is missing, which would cause the `test` function to be called with the wrong argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test(data, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function is being called with two arguments instead of one, which could cause it to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function is being called with two arguments instead of one, and the second argument is `true` instead of `data`, which could cause it to behave differently.

DONE.
