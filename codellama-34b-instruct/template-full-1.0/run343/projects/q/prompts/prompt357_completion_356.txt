  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a valid value in JavaScript, but it is not an instance of the `Error` class, which is the type of the `exception` variable. If `exception` is not an instance of `Error`, the `reject` function will not be called with the correct arguments, and the promise will not be rejected with the expected error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a different function than `reject`, and it may have different behavior, such as not rejecting the promise with the correct error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw exception
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` will cause the function to exit immediately, without continuing to execute any further code. This could cause unexpected behavior in the program, such as not rejecting the promise with the correct error.
