  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
adjust(this.longitude + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `adjust` function is called with a different input, which would change the output of the `adjustPrecision` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
adjust(this.longitude * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `adjust` function is called with a different input, which would change the output of the `adjustPrecision` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
adjust(this.longitude - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `adjust` function is called with a different input, which would change the output of the `adjustPrecision` method.

DONE.
