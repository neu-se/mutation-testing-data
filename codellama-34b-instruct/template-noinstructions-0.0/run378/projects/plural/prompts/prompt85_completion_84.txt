This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'mouse', 'mice'`, which would correctly pluralize the word "mouse" as "mice". However, replacing it with `'mice', 'mice'` would result in the same word being returned, which would not be correct.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'mouse', 'mice'`, which would correctly pl
