  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to advance by one more step than the original code, potentially skipping over important operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to advance by one less step than the original code, potentially missing important operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to advance by twice as many steps as the original code, potentially skipping over important operations or repeating operations that should only be performed once.

DONE.
