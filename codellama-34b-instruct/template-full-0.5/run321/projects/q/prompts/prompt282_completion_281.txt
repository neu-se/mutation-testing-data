  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a different slice of the `arguments` object, potentially changing the value of `value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a different slice of the `arguments` object, potentially changing the value of `value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
4
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a different slice of the `arguments` object, potentially changing the value of `value`.

DONE.
