Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'$$'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is now '$$' instead of '$', which could lead to incorrect path replacements if the target path contains multiple '$' characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'&'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is now '&' instead of '$', which would not match the intended replacement character and could lead to incorrect path replacements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
file.name
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is now the file name instead of '$', which would lead to incorrect path replacements and potentially cause errors if the file name contains special characters or is not a valid path component.

DONE.
