 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$(this).attr('href') || ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an empty string if the `href` attribute is not present or is falsy, instead of `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$(this).attr('data-href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would try to get the `data-href` attribute instead of the `href` attribute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$(this).prop('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the actual value of the `href` attribute, while `.attr()` returns the attribute as it was set in the HTML.

DONE.
