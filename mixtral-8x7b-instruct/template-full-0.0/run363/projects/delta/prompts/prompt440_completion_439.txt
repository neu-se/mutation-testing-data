 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
nextOp.insert !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow any non-null value for the `insert` property, not just strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
nextOp.hasOwnProperty('insert')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the existence of the `insert` property instead of checking if it is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Array.isArray(nextOp.insert)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `insert` is an array, which is not compatible with the original code that expects a string.

DONE.
