  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Buffer.isBuffer(content)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` when `content` is a string, whereas the original code fragment would return `true` if `content` is a buffer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof content === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when `content` is `undefined`, whereas the original code fragment would return `false` if `content` is not a buffer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content instanceof Buffer
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` when `content` is a string, whereas the original code fragment would return `true` if `content` is a buffer.

DONE.
