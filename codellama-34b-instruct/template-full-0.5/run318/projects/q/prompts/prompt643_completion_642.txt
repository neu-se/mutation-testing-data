  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [args, name]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, which could cause the `dispatch` method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, args[0]]
```
This would result in different behavior because only the first element of the `args` array is being passed as the second argument to `dispatch`, which could cause the method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, [args]]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` array is being wrapped in another array, which could cause the `dispatch` method to behave differently.

DONE.
