  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push('/([^/]+)', '/([^/]+)')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push two elements to the `parts` array instead of one, which would cause the regular expression to match more than one segment of the path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push('/([^/]+)')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push a different regular expression to the `parts` array, which would cause the matcher to match a different set of paths.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push('/([^/]+)', '/([^/]+)')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push two elements to the `parts` array, which would cause the regular expression to match more than one segment of the path.

DONE.
