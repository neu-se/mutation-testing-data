  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the new op at the end of the ops array, instead of at the specified index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the new op at the beginning of the ops array, instead of at the specified index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(Math.random() * this.ops.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the new op at a random position in the ops array, instead of at the specified index.

DONE.
