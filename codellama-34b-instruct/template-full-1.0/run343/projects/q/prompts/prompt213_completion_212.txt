  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike(value) === true
```
This would result in different behavior because we are adding an extra condition that checks if the value is a truthy promise alike value. In the original code, we only check if the value is a promise alike value, which means it has a `then` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.then !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because we are checking if the `then` method exists on the value, rather than checking if the value is a promise alike value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.toString().includes("Promise")
```
This would result in different behavior because we are checking if the string representation of the value includes the word "Promise", rather than checking if the value is a promise alike value.

DONE.
