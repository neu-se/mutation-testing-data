  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeTimezone;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `memoizeTimezone` function is called twice in the original code, but with this change, it would only be called once. This could cause issues if the first call to `memoizeTimezone` has side effects that are important for the correctness of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeTimezone(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `memoizeTimezone` function expects a timezone object as its argument, but with this change, it would be called with `undefined` instead. This could cause the function to throw an exception or produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeTimezone(timezones[name]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `memoizeTimezone` function expects a timezone object as its argument, but with this change, it would be called with a different timezone
