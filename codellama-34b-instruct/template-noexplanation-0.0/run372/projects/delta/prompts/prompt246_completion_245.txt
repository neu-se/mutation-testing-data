  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.retain
```
This will cause the `retDelta` object to retain the deleted text, rather than deleting it, which is the opposite of the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.insert
```
This will cause the `retDelta` object to insert the deleted text, rather than deleting it, which is the opposite of the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.delete
```
This will cause the `retDelta` object to delete the deleted text, which is the intended behavior.

DONE.
