  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` function is called with a different argument than the original `cb` function, which could cause the stream to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
last
```
This would result in different behavior because the `last` variable is a boolean value that is used to determine whether the stream should continue reading after the first item for which the `test` function returns `false`, which could cause the stream to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value is used to indicate that the stream has reached the end, which could cause the stream to behave differently.

DONE.
