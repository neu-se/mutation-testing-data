  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the result of `Array.isArray`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when the `ops` parameter is not an array, and `false` when it is an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(ops)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Array.isArray` method would be called on the `ops` parameter, which would always return `true` if `ops` is an array, and `false` if it is not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of an array is always greater than 0, so the `if` statement would always evaluate to `true` when `ops` is an array, and `false` when it is not.

DONE.
