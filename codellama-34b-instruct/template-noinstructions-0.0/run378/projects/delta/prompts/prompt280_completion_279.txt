  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.retain` is a number, while `thisOp` is an object with a `retain` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.retain` is a number, while `otherOp` is an object with a `retain` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.retain` is a method, while `thisOp` and `otherOp` are objects with a `retain` property.

DONE.
