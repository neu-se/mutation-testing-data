  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative sign would cause the result of the cosh function to be negated, leading to a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the cos function has a different range and behavior than the cosh function, leading to a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because the sinh function has a different range and behavior than the cosh function, leading to a different result.

DONE.
