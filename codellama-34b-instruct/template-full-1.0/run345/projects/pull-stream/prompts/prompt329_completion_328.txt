  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op == false
```
This would result in different behavior because `op == false` is always false, so the `op` function would never be called, whereas the original code fragment `op` would be called if `op` is not null or undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op && !op
```
This would result in different behavior because `op && !op` is always false, so the `op` function would never be called, whereas the original code fragment `op` would be called if `op` is not null or undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op || null
```
This would result in different behavior because `op || null` would always return `null`, whereas the original code fragment `op` would return a value that is not `null` or `undefined`.

DONE.
