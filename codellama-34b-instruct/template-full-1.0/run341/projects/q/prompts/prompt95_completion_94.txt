  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
++index > length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `>=` operator is replaced with `>`, which would cause the loop to terminate one iteration earlier.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one more time, as the value of `index` would be decremented each time.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop condition would be satisfied one iteration earlier, as the value of `length` would be decremented each time.
