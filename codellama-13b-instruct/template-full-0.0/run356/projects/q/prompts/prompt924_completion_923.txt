  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the second argument to the `setTimeout` function instead of the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the last argument to the `setTimeout` function instead of the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.concat(nodeArgs)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the same argument twice to the `setTimeout` function.

DONE.
