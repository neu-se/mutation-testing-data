  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `undefined`, which is a valid value for the `message` parameter of `postMessage()`. Replacing it with `0` would cause the message to be interpreted as a number, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the receiving code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `undefined`, which is a valid value for the `message` parameter of `postMessage()`. Replacing it with `null` would cause the message to be interpreted as a null value, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the receiving code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `undefined`, which is a valid value for the `message` parameter of `postMessage()`. Replacing it with a string value would cause the message to be interpreted as a string, which could lead to
