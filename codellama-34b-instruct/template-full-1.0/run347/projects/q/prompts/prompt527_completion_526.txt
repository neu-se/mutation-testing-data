  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value
```
This would result in different behavior because the `value` function is not defined in the context of `master()`, and would cause an error if used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.apply(void 0, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `op` function with the `args` array as its arguments, rather than the `object` and `op` arguments as before.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return op.apply(void 0, args); }()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `op` function with the `args` array as its arguments, and then immediately invoke the function.

DONE.
