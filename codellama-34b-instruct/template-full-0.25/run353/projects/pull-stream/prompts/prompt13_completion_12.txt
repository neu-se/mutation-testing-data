  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would decrement `i` instead of incrementing it, potentially causing an infinite loop or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would increment `i` by 2 instead of 1, potentially causing the loop to skip over certain elements in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at the last element of the array instead of the first, potentially causing the loop to skip over certain elements in the array.

DONE.
