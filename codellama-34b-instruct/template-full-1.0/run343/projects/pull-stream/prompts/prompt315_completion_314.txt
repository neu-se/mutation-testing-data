  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, data
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not equal to `null`, so the last test would not pass.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, 'different data'
```
This would result in different behavior because `data` is not equal to `'different data'`, so the last test would not pass.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, data + 'extra_data'
```
This would result in different behavior because `data` is not equal to `data + 'extra_data'`, so the last test would not pass.

DONE.
