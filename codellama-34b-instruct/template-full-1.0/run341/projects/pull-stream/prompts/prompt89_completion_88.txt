  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because `!test` is logically opposite to `test`, so it would cause the function to return the opposite result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test && false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `&&` operator to return `false` if `test` is truthy, regardless of the value of the second operand.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test || true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `||` operator to return `true` if `test` is falsy, regardless of the value of the second operand.

DONE.
