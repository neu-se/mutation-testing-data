  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Object.keys` method to operate on the `a` object instead of the `b` object, which could potentially change the set of keys that are returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Object.keys` method to return all the own properties of the `a` object, rather than just the enumerable ones.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Object.keys` method to return an empty object, rather than the set of enumerable properties of the `a` object.

DONE.
