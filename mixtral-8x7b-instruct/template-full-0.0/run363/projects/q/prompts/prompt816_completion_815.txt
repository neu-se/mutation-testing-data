 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { throw new Error('Manually rejected'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method would now throw an error instead of doing nothing when no arguments are provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject(new Error('Manually rejected'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method would now return a rejected promise with a custom error instead of doing nothing when no arguments are provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return Promise.resolve(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method would now return a resolved promise when no arguments are provided, instead of doing nothing.

DONE.
