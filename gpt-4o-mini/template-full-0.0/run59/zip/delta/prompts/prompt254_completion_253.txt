Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek()` returns the next operation without advancing the iterator, which means the same operation would be processed multiple times instead of moving to the next one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(opLength)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `thisIter` iterator instead of `otherIter`, which means it would incorrectly process operations from the current instance instead of the other instance, leading to incorrect diffs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(opLength + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to retrieve one more operation than available, which could lead to an out-of-bounds error or unexpected behavior if the length of `otherIter` is less than `opLength + 1`.

DONE.
