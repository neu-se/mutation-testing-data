  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because a rejected promise would be returned, which is the opposite of the original behavior of fulfilling the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because a rejected promise would be returned with an error message, which is different from the original behavior of fulfilling the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because a rejected promise would be returned with an error message, which is different from the original behavior of fulfilling the promise and cannot be chained to a `then` method.

DONE.
