Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"invalid stack line"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string does not match the expected format of a stack line, causing `getFileNameAndLineNumber` to return `undefined`, which would lead to `isInternalFrame` returning `false` even for valid stack lines.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine + " extra text"
```
This would result in different behavior because appending extra text to the stack line would cause the regex patterns in `getFileNameAndLineNumber` to fail, resulting in `undefined` being returned and thus `isInternalFrame` returning `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` to `getFileNameAndLineNumber` would cause it to return `undefined`, leading to `isInternalFrame` returning `false`, which would prevent the correct identification of internal frames.

DONE.
