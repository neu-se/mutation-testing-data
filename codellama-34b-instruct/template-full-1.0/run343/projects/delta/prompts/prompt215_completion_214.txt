  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops.splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` is a method that removes and replaces elements in an array, while `concat` is a method that returns a new array formed by merging two or more arrays.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` is a method that adds one or more elements to the end of an array, while `concat` returns a new array formed by merging two or more arrays.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops.join
```
This would result in different behavior because `join` is a method that creates and returns a new string by concatenating all of the elements in an array, while `concat` returns a new array formed by merging two or more arrays.

DONE.
