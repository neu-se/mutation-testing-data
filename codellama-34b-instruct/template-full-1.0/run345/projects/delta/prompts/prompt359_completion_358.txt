  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because it would refer to the `this` keyword, which would cause the `transformPosition` method to be applied to the current object, rather than the `Delta` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.transform
```
This would result in different behavior because it would refer to the `transform` method of the `Delta` class, rather than the `transformPosition` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.transformPosition(other)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `transformPosition` method on the `other` object, rather than the `this` object.

DONE.
