  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.path
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx.path` is a different value than `ctx`, and could potentially cause the `matches` method to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.verb
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx.verb` is a different value than `ctx`, and could potentially cause the `query` method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.path.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx.path.slice(0)` is a different value than `ctx.path`, and could potentially cause the `matches` method to return a different result.

DONE.
