 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === 0 && this['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for a specific value (0) instead of using the `isFinite` function, which checks if the value is a finite number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isFinite(this['im'])
