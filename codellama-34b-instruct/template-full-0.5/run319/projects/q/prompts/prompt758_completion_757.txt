  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"allFulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because "allFulfilled" is a different method than "allSettled".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"allRejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because "allRejected" is a different method than "allSettled".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"anySettled"
```
This would result in different behavior because "anySettled" is a different method than "allSettled".

DONE.
