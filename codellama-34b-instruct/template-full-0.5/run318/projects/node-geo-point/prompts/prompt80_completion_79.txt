  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1 + λ2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the longitude of the current point to the longitude of the destination point, instead of subtracting them as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1 * λ2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the longitude of the current point by the longitude of the destination point, instead of subtracting them as in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1 - λ2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the longitude of the destination point from the longitude of the current point, instead of adding them as in the original code.

DONE.
