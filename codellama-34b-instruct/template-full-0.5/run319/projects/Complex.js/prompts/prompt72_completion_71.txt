  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `tokens` array is `null`, while this new code checks if the `tokens` array has a length of 0. This change would cause the code to enter the `if` block if the `tokens` array is empty, rather than if it is `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[0] === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `tokens` array is `null`, while this new code checks if the first element of the `tokens` array is `null`. This change would cause the code to enter the `if` block if the first element of the `tokens` array is `null`, rather than if the array itself is `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[0] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original
