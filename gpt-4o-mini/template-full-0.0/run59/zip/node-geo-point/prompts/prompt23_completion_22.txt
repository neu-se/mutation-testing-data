Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'lat'
```
This would result in different behavior because the object property 'lat' does not exist in the expected input, leading to a TypeError when the code checks for the presence of 'latitude' in the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'latitude' + 'extra'
```
This would result in different behavior because the concatenation of 'latitude' with 'extra' creates a string that does not match the expected property name, causing the check for 'latitude' to fail and throw a TypeError.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'longitude' 
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly check for the presence of 'longitude' instead of 'latitude', leading to a TypeError when the input object is missing the 'latitude' property.

DONE.
