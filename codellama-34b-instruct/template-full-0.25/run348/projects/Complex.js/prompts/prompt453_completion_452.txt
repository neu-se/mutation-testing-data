  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] * this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operator `*` is used instead of the subtraction operator `-`, which would cause the result to be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] + this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition operator `+` is used instead of the subtraction operator `-`, which would cause the result to be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] - this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `re` property is used instead of the `im` property, which would cause the result to be different.

DONE.
