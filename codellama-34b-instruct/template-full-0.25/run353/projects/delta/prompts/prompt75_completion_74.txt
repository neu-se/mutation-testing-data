  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cloneShallow
```
This would result in different behavior because `cloneShallow` only creates a shallow copy of the object, whereas `cloneDeep` creates a deep copy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clone
```
This would result in different behavior because `clone` is not a function and would cause a syntax error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))` creates a deep copy of the object, but it would not copy any non-JSON values, such as functions or symbols.

DONE.
