  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w !== 'dwarf' && w !== 'roof'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `w` is either `'dwarf'` or `'roof'`, while this new code fragment checks if `w` is not `'dwarf'` and not `'roof'`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w !== 'dwarf' || w !== 'roof'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `w` is either `'dwarf'` or `'roof'`, while this new code fragment checks if `w` is not `'dwarf'` or not `'roof'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w !== 'dwarf' && w !== 'roof' && w !== 'f'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `w` is either `'dwarf'` or `'roof'
