  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListener()
```
This would result in different behavior because `progressListener()` is a function call, whereas `progressListener` is a reference to a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListener.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because `progressListener.call()` is a function call with an implicit `this` argument, whereas `progressListener` is a reference to a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListener.apply()
```
This would result in different behavior because `progressListener.apply()` is a function call with an explicit `this` argument, whereas `progressListener` is a reference to a function.

DONE.
