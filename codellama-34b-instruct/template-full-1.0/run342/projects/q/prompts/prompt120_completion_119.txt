  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString
```
This would result in different behavior because toString() is a method that returns a string representation of an object, whereas hasOwnProperty() is a method that returns a boolean indicating whether an object has a specified property as its own property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.valueOf
```
This would result in different behavior because valueOf() is a method that returns the primitive value of an object, whereas hasOwnProperty() is a method that returns a boolean indicating whether an object has a specified property as its own property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because bind() creates a new function that has the same body and scope as the original one, but with the "this" argument bound to null. This would cause the hasOwnProperty() method to always return false, as it would be called on null instead of the object being
