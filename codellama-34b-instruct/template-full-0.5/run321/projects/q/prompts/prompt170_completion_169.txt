  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.split("")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the `line` string contains the substring "node.js", while this alternative checks if the `line` string is empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.split(" ")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the `line` string contains the substring "node.js", while this alternative checks if the first word in the `line` string is "node.js".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.includes("node.js")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the `line` string contains the substring "node.js", while this alternative checks if the `line` string contains the substring "node.js" in a case-sensitive manner.

DONE.
