  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a promise and would cause an error when trying to call `promiseDispatch` on it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a promise and would cause an error when trying to call `promiseDispatch` on it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolvedPromise.promise` is a promise and would not cause an error when trying to call `promiseDispatch` on it, but it would also not be the correct promise to use in this context.

DONE.
