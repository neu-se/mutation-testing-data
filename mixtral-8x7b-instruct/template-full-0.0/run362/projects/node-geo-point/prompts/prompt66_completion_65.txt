 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan` only takes one argument, while `atan2` takes two arguments and considers the sign of both arguments to compute the correct quadrant of the result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan2(y, -x)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the sign of the second argument, which would result in a 180-degree rotation of the bearing angle.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan2(x, y)
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the order of the arguments, which would result in a 90-degree rotation of the bearing angle.

By introducing these changes, we can expose potential weaknesses in the test suite, as the tests should ideally catch these modifications and fail, indicating that the tests are effectively checking the behavior of the `calculateB
