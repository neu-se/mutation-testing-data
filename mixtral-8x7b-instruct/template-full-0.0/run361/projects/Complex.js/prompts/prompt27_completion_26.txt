 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'Bad Param'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'Invalid Param'.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the error message to uppercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'Invalid Param'.concat('!')
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends an exclamation mark to the error message.

DONE.
