  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a JavaScript keyword that represents the absence of a value, while `void 0` is an expression that evaluates to `undefined`. In this context, `void 0` is used to indicate that the third argument to the `then` method should be `undefined`, which means that the promise will not be resolved with any value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because `true` is a JavaScript keyword that represents a boolean true value, while `void 0` is an expression that evaluates to `undefined`. In this context, `void 0` is used to indicate that the third argument to the `then` method should be `undefined`, which means that the promise will not be resolved with any value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `function () {}` is a function expression that returns `undefined
