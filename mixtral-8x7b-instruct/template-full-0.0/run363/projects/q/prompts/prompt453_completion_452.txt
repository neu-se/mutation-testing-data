 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unhandledReasons.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because unshift adds the reason to the beginning of the array, rather than the end. This could cause issues in tracking unhandled rejections if the code relies on the order of the reasons.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
console.error
```
This would result in different behavior because it would print the error stack to the console instead of adding it to the `unhandledReasons` array. This would prevent the error from being tracked and handled properly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unhandledReasons.push(reason.toString())
