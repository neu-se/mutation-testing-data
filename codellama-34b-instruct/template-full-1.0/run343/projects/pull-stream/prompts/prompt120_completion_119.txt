  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === null ? null : end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat `null` as a special case, while the original code fragment would treat it as a regular value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === false ? null : end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat `false` as a special case, while the original code fragment would treat it as a regular value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === undefined ? null : end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat `undefined` as a special case, while the original code fragment would treat it as a regular value.

DONE.
