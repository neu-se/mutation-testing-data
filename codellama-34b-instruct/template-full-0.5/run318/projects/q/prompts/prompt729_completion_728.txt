  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `promises.slice(1)` returns a new array containing all elements of `promises` except the first one, whereas `promises` returns the original array. This change would cause the `all` function to resolve with a different array of promises, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the calling code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.concat([Q.reject("error")])
```
This would result in different behavior because `promises.concat([Q.reject("error")])` returns a new array containing all elements of `promises` followed by a new promise that is rejected with the error message "error". This change would cause the `all` function to reject with the error message "error", even if all the promises in the original array were resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.map(function (promise) { return Q.resolve
