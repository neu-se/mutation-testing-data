  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code fragment, if `end` is not true, `mapper` is applied to `data`. However, if `mapper` is `null`, it would result in a `TypeError` when it is applied to `data`, which would cause the function to return `null` instead of the mapped value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code fragment, if `end` is not true, `mapper` is applied to `data`. However, if `mapper` is `undefined`, it would result in a `TypeError` when it is applied to `data`, which would cause the function to return `undefined` instead of the mapped value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code fragment, if `end` is not true, `mapper` is applied
