  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"verb".toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the `verb` string to lowercase, which may not be desirable in the context of the `query()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb.split(" ")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first word of the `verb` string, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb.replace("ing", "")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the "ing" suffix from the `verb` string, which may not be desirable in the context of the `query()` method.

DONE.
