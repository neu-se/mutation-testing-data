  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.pipe({})
```
This would result in different behavior because `res.pipe({})` creates a new object and pipes the response data to it, whereas the original `res.pipe` pipes the response data to the `dest` file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.pipe(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `res.pipe(undefined)` pipes the response data to `undefined`, whereas the original `res.pipe` pipes the response data to the `dest` file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.pipe(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `res.pipe(null)` pipes the response data to `null`, whereas the original `res.pipe` pipes the response data to the `dest` file.

DONE.
