  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp === 42
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison would always evaluate to false, causing the `if` statement to always return `false` even if `otherOp.attributes` exists.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp !== 42
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison would always evaluate to true, causing the `if` statement to always return `true` even if `otherOp.attributes` doesn't exist.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.attributes[otherOp.retain]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the `retain` attribute in `otherOp.attributes`, which would cause the `Delta` object to be modified in a different way.

DONE.
