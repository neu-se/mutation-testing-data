  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.print
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` is a method that creates a new array by concatenating two or more arrays or values, while `print` is a console method that prints the array to the console.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` returns a new array containing the elements of both the original array and the new values, while `slice` returns a shallow copy of a portion of the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.expand
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` returns a new array containing the elements of both the original array and the new values, while `expand` is not a built-in method in JavaScript and would result in an error.

DONE.
