  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `callback` function would not be called with the expected arguments, which could lead to unexpected results or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `callback` function would not be called at all, as `undefined` is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `callback` function would be called with an empty function as its argument, which could lead to unexpected results or errors.

DONE.
