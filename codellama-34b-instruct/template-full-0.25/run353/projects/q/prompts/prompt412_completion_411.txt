  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the promise is fulfilled, while this new code fragment checks if the promise is rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.value === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the promise is fulfilled, while this new code fragment checks if the promise's value is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the promise is fulfilled, while this new code fragment checks if the promise is pending.

DONE.
