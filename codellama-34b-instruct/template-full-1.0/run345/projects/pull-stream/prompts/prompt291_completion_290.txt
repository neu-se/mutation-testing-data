  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `nonUnique` would always return `true`, regardless of the input value, when the mutant is applied.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `nonUnique` would return `undefined` instead of `true`, when the mutant is applied.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `nonUnique` would return `false`, instead of `true`, when the mutant is applied.

DONE.
