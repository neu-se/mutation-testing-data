  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("something went wrong"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would resolve the promise with the result of `Q(object).promiseDispatch(deferred.resolve, op, args)`, while the modified code fragment would reject the promise with the error "something went wrong".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(op)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would resolve the promise with the result of `Q(object).promiseDispatch(deferred.resolve, op, args)`, while the modified code fragment would resolve the promise with the value of `op`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would resolve the promise with the result of `Q(object).promiseDispatch(deferred.resolve, op, args)`, while the modified code fragment would resolve the promise with the
