  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the `inspect` method of the promise, while the modified code fragment calls the `inspect` method and returns its result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the `inspect` method of the promise, while the modified code fragment returns a bound version of the `inspect` method that is bound to the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the `inspect` method of the promise, while the modified code fragment calls the `inspect` method and returns its result, but with the `this` context set to the promise.

DONE.
