  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && true
```
This would result in different behavior because `end && true` is always truthy, whereas `end` is only truthy if the stream has ended. This change would cause the `once` function to be called even if the stream has not ended, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || false
```
This would result in different behavior because `end || false` is always truthy, whereas `end` is only truthy if the stream has ended. This change would cause the `once` function to be called even if the stream has not ended, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because `end !== true` is always truthy, whereas `end` is only truthy if the stream has ended. This change would cause the `once` function to be called even if the stream has not ended, which could lead to unexpected behavior
