  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_parts.replace("default.com");
```
This would result in different behavior because the replace method is not accessible on the pageurl_parts array, which was converted to a string in the previous line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace("default.com");
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the replace method should be a string or a regular expression, but "default.com" is a boolean value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '/');
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is not enclosed in forward slashes, which is a syntax error.

DONE.
