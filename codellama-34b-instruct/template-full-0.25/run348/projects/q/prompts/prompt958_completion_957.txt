  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bound` function is not called, and the promise is resolved with `undefined` instead of the expected result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bound` function is not called, and the promise is resolved with `undefined` instead of the expected result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bound` function is not called, and the promise is resolved with the `this` value of the current context instead of the expected result.

DONE.
