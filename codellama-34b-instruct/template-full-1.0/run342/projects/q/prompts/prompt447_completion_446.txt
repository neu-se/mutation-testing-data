  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array would not be updated when a rejection occurred, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array would be updated with an `undefined` value when a rejection occurred, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.getUnhandledReasons()[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array would be updated with the first reason from the `unhandledReasons` array, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
