  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.message
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the `exception` object, which may contain more information than just the message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the `exception` object, which may contain more information than just the stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the `exception` object, which may contain more information than just the string representation of the exception.

DONE.
