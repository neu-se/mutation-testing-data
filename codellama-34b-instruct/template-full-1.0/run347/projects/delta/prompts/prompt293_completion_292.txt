  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
line.insert({ color: 'red' }, +);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert a new attribute `{ color: 'red' }` into the `line` object, while the original code fragment would push a new value to the `line` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
line.pop;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last value from the `line` array, instead of pushing a new value to it as the original code fragment does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
line.splice(0, 0, otherOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert `otherOp` at the beginning of the `line` array, instead of pushing it to the end as the original code fragment does.

DONE.
