 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
item + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment converts `item` to a number and adds 1, while the original code fragment simply pushes the `item` value into the accumulator array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment pushes a random number into the accumulator array, while the original code fragment pushes the `item` value into the accumulator array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr[arr.length] = item
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment assigns `item` to the last element of the accumulator array, while the original code fragment pushes `item` into the accumulator array.

DONE.
