  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method is called with a different second argument, which would change the resulting array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 3)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method is called with a different second argument, which would change the resulting array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 4)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method is called with a different second argument, which would change the resulting array.

DONE.
