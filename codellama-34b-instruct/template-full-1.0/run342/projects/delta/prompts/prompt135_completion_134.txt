  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next()` would advance the iterator permanently, whereas `otherIter.peek()` only peeks at the current element without advancing the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.hasNext()` returns a boolean indicating whether there are more elements in the iteration, whereas `otherIter.peek()` returns the current element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.isNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.isNext()` returns a boolean indicating whether the next element satisfies a certain condition, whereas `otherIter.peek()` returns the current element.

DONE.
