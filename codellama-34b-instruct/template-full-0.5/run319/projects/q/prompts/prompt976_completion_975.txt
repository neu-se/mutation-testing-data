  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` parameter is expected to be an array, but `null` is not an array and would cause the `array_slice` method to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` parameter is expected to be an array, but `undefined` is not an array and would cause the `array_slice` method to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` parameter is expected to be an array, but `[]` is an empty array and would cause the `array_slice` method to return an empty array, which would not include the expected arguments.

DONE.
