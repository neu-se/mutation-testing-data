  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.op.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was using the `insert` property of the `thisOp` object, while the proposed replacement uses the `insert` property of the `otherOp` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was using the `insert` property of the `thisOp` object, while the proposed replacement uses the `insert` property of the `otherOp` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was using the `insert` property of the `thisOp` object, while the proposed replacement uses the `null` value.

DONE.
