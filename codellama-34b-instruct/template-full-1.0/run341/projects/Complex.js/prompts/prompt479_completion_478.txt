  Sure, here are three possible mutations:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the value of `this['im']`, which is a number. This would cause the `isFinite` check to always return `false`, even if the value of `this['re']` is finite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `this['im']`, which would affect the result of the `isFinite` check. For example, if `this['im']` is equal to 0, the check would fail, but if `this['im']` is equal to 1, the check would pass.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the finiteness of `this['re']
