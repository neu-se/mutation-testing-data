  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>("<some string>", []);
```
This would result in different behavior because the passed argument is a string, whereas the method is expecting an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>([]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the method call is missing the argument for the event name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(true, []);
```
This would result in different behavior because the method call is passing `true` for the `pref` argument, which would cause the method to use the trickle algorithm for scheduling the event.

DONE.
