  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
all
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` function is used to wait for all promises to be settled, whereas the original code uses `any` to wait for any promise to be fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when
```
This would result in different behavior because the `when` function is used to wait for a promise to be fulfilled, whereas the original code uses `any` to wait for any promise to be fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.all` function is used to wait for all promises to be settled, whereas the original code uses `any` to wait for any promise to be fulfilled.

DONE.
