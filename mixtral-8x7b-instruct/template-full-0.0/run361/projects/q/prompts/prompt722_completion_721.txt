 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
snapshot.state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now check if the promise is in the "pending" state instead of the "fulfilled" state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
isPromise(promise) && (snapshot = promise.inspect()).state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now check if the promise is in the "rejected" state instead of the "fulfilled" state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
snapshot.state !== "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now check for any state other than "fulfilled", which would include both "pending" and "rejected" states.

DONE.
