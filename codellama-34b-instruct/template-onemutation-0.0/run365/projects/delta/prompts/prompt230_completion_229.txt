  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of a string returns the number of characters in the string, while `length + 1` would return the number of characters plus one. This would cause the `diff` function to produce a different output, potentially leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
