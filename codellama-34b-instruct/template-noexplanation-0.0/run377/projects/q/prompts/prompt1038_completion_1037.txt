  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This change will cause the `closed` variable to be initialized with a promise that is already resolved, which may cause the `get` method to return a resolved promise instead of a pending one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().promise
```
This change will cause the `closed` variable to be initialized with a promise that is already resolved, but it will also cause the `get` method to return a pending promise instead of a resolved one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().promise.then(function() { return Q.reject(new Error("Can't get value from closed queue")); })
```
This change will cause the `closed` variable to be initialized with a promise that is already resolved, but it will also cause the `get` method to return a pending promise that is rejected with an error.

DONE.
