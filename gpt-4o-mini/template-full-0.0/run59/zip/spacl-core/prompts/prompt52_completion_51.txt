Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.unshift('/([^/]+)')
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the new regex segment to the beginning of the `parts` array instead of the end, which would change the order of the segments in the final regex, potentially leading to incorrect matching.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push(`/${part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$1')}*`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends a `*` quantifier to the regex segment, allowing for zero or more occurrences of the matched segment, which could lead to unintended matches compared to the original behavior that requires at least one occurrence.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push(`/${part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$1')}/g`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly adds a global flag (`g`) to the regex segment, which is not valid in this context and would cause the regex to behave unexpectedly, potentially leading to runtime errors or incorrect matching.

DONE.
