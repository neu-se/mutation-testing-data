  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.done
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` property is only present in the resolved state, so it would always return `undefined` in the pending state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fail
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is only present in the resolved state, so it would always return `undefined` in the pending state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.caught
```
This would result in different behavior because the `caught` method is only present in the resolved state, so it would always return `undefined` in the pending state.

DONE.
