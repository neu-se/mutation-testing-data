  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("set", [key, value])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `dispatch` method with the `set` operation, which would set the property `key` to `value` on the object, rather than returning a promise for the property value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("get", [key])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `dispatch` method with the `get` operation, which would return a promise for the property value, rather than setting the property `key` to `value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("delete", [key])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `dispatch` method with the `delete` operation, which would delete the property `key` from the object, rather than returning a promise for the property value.

DONE.
