  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would not be called, and the `unhandledRejections` array would not be updated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would not be called, and the `unhandledRejections` array would not be updated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would not be called, and the `unhandledRejections` array would not be updated.

DONE.
