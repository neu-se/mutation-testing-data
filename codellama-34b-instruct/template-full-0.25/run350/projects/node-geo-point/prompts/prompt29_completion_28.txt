  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude and longitude values are swapped, which would cause the calculation of the distance and bearing to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude value of the first point is used instead of the second point, which would cause the calculation of the distance and bearing to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the longitude value of the first point is used instead of the second point, which would cause the calculation of the distance and bearing to be incorrect.

DONE.
