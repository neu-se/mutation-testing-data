  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function returns the sine of a number, whereas the `cos` function returns the cosine. This means that the function would be computing the sine of the input argument, rather than the cosine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abs` function returns the absolute value of a number, whereas the `cos` function returns the cosine. This means that the function would be computing the absolute value of the input argument, rather than the cosine.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function returns the cosine of a number, whereas the `sin` function returns the sine. This means that the function would be computing the recipro
