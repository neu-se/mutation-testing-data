  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['acos'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the calculation of `acos` to be off by 1, making the output incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['acos'] - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the calculation of `acos` to be off by 1, making the output incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['acosh']
```
This would result in different behavior because `acosh` is a different function than `acos`, and would result in a different output.

DONE.
