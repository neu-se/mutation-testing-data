  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.max` returns the largest value, whereas `Math.min` returns the smallest value. This would cause the comparison to be reversed, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number, whereas `Math.min` returns the smallest value. This would cause the comparison to be different, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given number, whereas `Math.min` returns the smallest value. This would cause the comparison to be different, potentially leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
