  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let firstLeft = firstOther.retain;
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable `firstLeft` is not declared in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let firstLeft = other.ops.length;
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable `firstLeft` is now set to the length of the `other` delta, rather than the number of elements in the first operation of the `other` delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let firstLeft = this.ops.length;
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable `firstLeft` is now set to the length of the `this` delta, rather than the number of elements in the first operation of the `other` delta.

DONE.
