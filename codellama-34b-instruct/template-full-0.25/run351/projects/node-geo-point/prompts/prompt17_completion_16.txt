  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, which would cause the `fromLngLatArray()` method to interpret the latitude and longitude values in the wrong order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method returns a new array with the elements from the specified start index to the end of the array, which would cause the `fromLngLatArray()` method to interpret the latitude and longitude values as if they were in a different order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.concat([0, 0])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat()` method returns a new array with the elements from the original array followed by the elements from the specified array, which would cause the `fromLngLatArray()` method to interpret the latitude and longitude values
