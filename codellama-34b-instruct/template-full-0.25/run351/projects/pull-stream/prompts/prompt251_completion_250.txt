  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function `cb` would not be called, which could cause the stream to hang or behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` signal would not be passed to the `read` function, which could cause the stream to continue reading even after it has been aborted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called with the `abort` signal as its first argument, which could cause the stream to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
