  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.pop(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop` method without an argument removes the last element of the array, while the `pop` method with an argument removes the element at the specified index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.pop(<PLACEHOLDER> + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would remove the element at the next index, rather than the current index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.pop(<PLACEHOLDER> - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would remove the element at the previous index, rather than the current index.

DONE.
