  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\t"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the separator between stack trace lines from a newline to a tab.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the separator between stack trace lines from a newline to a space.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"<br>"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the separator between stack trace lines from a newline to an HTML line break.

DONE.
