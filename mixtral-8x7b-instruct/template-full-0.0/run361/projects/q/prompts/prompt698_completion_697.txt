 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
args.length > 0 ? args : [null];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes an empty array if `args` is not provided, while this change passes `[null]` when `args` is not provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
arguments;
