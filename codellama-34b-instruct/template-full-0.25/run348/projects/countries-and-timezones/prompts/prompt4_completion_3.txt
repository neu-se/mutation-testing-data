  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezonesMap === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `!timezonesMap` checks if `timezonesMap` is falsy, while the new code fragment `timezonesMap === undefined` checks if `timezonesMap` is strictly equal to `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezonesMap !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `!timezonesMap` checks if `timezonesMap` is falsy, while the new code fragment `timezonesMap !== null` checks if `timezonesMap` is not strictly equal to `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezonesMap.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `!timezonesMap` checks if `timezonesMap` is falsy, while the new code fragment `timezonesMap.
