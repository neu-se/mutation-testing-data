  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` returns a new array with only the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, while `map` returns a new array with the result of calling the provided function on every element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.reduce
```
This would result in different behavior because `reduce` returns a single value that is the result of combining all the elements in the array using the provided function, while `map` returns a new array with the result of calling the provided function on every element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.forEach
```
This would result in different behavior because `forEach` executes the provided function on every element in the array, but does not return a new array or a single value.

DONE.
