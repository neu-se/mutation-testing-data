  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would give the real part of the complex number instead of the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the imaginary part of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would give the absolute value of the imaginary part of the complex number instead of the imaginary part itself.

DONE.
