  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'people'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the word "person" to "people", which is not the intended behavior for this rule.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'persons'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the word "person" to "persons", which is not the intended behavior for this rule.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'peoples'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the word "person" to "peoples", which is not the intended behavior for this rule.

DONE.
