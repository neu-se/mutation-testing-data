  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` event is emitted when the archive is fully written, while the `close` event is emitted when the archive is closed, but not necessarily fully written.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` event is emitted when an error occurs during the archiving process, while the `close` event is emitted when the archive is closed, regardless of whether an error occurred.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finish'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finish` event is emitted when the archiving process is complete, while the `close` event is emitted when the archive is closed, but not necessarily fully written.

DONE.
