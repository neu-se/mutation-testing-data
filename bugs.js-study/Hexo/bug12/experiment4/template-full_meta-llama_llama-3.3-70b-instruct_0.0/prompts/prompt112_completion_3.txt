Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data.slug.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method converts the string to uppercase, whereas the original code uses `toString()` and applies a case transformation based on the `config.filename_case` setting, which could result in different casing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data.slug + 'test'
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends the string 'test' to the `data.slug`, which would change the resulting slug and potentially affect the behavior of the `slugize` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
config.default_slug
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `config.default_slug` instead of the `data.slug`, which could be a different value and would bypass the transformation applied to `data.slug` in the original code.

DONE.
