  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
source(null, function (end, data) {
  //if ended immediately, and no initial...
  if(end) return cb(end === true ? null : end)
  acc = data; sink(null)
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sink` function is called with `null` instead of `data`, which could cause the `sink` function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
source(null, function (end, data) {
  //if ended immediately, and no initial...
  if(end) return cb(end === true ? null : end)
