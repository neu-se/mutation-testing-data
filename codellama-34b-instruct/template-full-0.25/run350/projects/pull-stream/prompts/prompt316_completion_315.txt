  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `terminate` calls the `cb` function with the `ended` argument, which is a boolean value indicating whether the stream has ended. In contrast, the new code fragment `cb(null, data)` calls the `cb` function with the `data` argument, which is the current item being read from the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(ended, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `terminate` calls the `cb` function with the `ended` argument, which is a boolean value indicating whether the stream has ended. In contrast, the new code fragment `cb(ended, data)` calls the `cb` function with the `ended` argument as the first argument and the `data` argument as the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different
