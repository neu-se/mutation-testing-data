  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because a value that is supposed to be fulfilled is instead rejected, leading to a different execution path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_progressed(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because a value that is supposed to be fulfilled is instead used as a progress notification, leading to a different execution path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because the fulfillment value is not the same as the original value, leading to a different execution path.

DONE.
