  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `reverse(<PLACEHOLDER>.slice(1))`. This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method will return a new string without the first character, while the `reverse` method will return a new string with the characters in reverse order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `reverse(<PLACEHOLDER>.slice(0))`. This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return a new string without the first character, while the `reverse` method would return a new string with the characters in reverse order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `reverse(<PLACEHOLDER>.split(''))`. This would result in different behavior because the `split` method would return an array of characters, while the `reverse` method would return a new string with the characters in reverse order.

DONE.
