  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops != null && ops.ops.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `ops` array has at least one element, whereas the original code fragment checks if the `ops` array is not null and is an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops != null && ops.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `ops` array has at least one element, whereas the original code fragment checks if the `ops` array is not null and is an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops != null && ops.ops.length > 0 && Array.isArray(ops.ops)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `ops` array has at least one element and is an array, whereas the original code fragment only checks if the `ops` array is not null and is an array.

DONE
