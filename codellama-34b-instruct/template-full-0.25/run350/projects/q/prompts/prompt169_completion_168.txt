  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isExternalFrame
```
This would result in different behavior because `isExternalFrame` is a different function that checks if a stack frame is external to the current file, whereas `isInternalFrame` checks if it is internal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isInternalFrame
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isInternalFrame` would negate the result of the `isInternalFrame` function, causing the `isNodeFrame` check to be skipped if the frame is internal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNodeFrame
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNodeFrame` checks if a stack frame is from Node.js, whereas `isInternalFrame` checks if it is internal to the current file.

DONE.
