  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(tzs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values()` returns an array of the values of the own enumerable string keyed properties of an object, while `Object.keys()` returns an array of the own enumerable string keyed properties of an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.getOwnPropertyNames(tzs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.getOwnPropertyNames()` returns an array of all properties (including non-enumerable properties) of an object, while `Object.keys()` returns an array of the own enumerable string keyed properties of an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries(tzs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries()` returns an array of key-value pairs of an object, while `Object.keys()` returns an array of the own enumerable string keyed properties of an object.
