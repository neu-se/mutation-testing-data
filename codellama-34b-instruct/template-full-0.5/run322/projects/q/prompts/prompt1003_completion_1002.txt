  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[nodeArgs, name]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array would be passed as the first argument to `this.dispatch()`, which would cause the method to be called with the wrong arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs.reverse()]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array would be passed in reverse order to `this.dispatch()`, which would cause the method to be called with the wrong arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs.slice(1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array would be passed without its first element to `this.dispatch()`, which would cause the method to be called with the wrong arguments.

DONE.
