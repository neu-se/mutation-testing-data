Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of the object's values instead of its keys, which would cause the `reduce` function to iterate over values rather than keys, leading to incorrect attribute mapping.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries` returns an array of key-value pairs, which would require a different handling mechanism in the `reduce` function, potentially causing mismatches in the attributes being transformed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(b).filter(key => key.startsWith('a'))
```
This would result in different behavior because filtering the keys to only those that start with 'a' would limit the attributes processed to a subset, potentially omitting valid attributes that should be included in the transformation.

DONE.
