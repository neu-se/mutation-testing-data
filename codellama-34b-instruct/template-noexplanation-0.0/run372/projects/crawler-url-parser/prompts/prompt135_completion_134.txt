  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "/")
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses a different regular expression to match the last part of the URL path. The regular expression `/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/` matches a forward slash followed by any number of non-forward-slash characters, followed by an optional forward slash at the end of the string. The replacement string is simply a forward slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "")
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses a different regular expression to match the last part of the URL path. The regular expression `/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/` matches a forward slash followed by any number of non-forward-slash characters, followed by an optional forward slash at the end of the string. The replacement string is an empty string.
