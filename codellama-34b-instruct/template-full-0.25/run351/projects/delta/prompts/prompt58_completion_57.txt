  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the result of `Array.isArray`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `ops` is not an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(ops)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Array.isArray` method would be called on `ops` directly, rather than on the result of `ops.ops`. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if `ops` is an array, regardless of whether it has an `ops` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.ops.isArray
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isArray` property would be accessed on the result of `ops.ops`, rather than on `ops` itself. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if `ops.
