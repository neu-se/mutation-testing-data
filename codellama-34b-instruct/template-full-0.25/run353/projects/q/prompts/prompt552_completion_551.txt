  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(result.value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` returns a rejected promise, whereas `when` returns a promise for the result of the operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(result.value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` returns a promise for the value, whereas `when` returns a promise for the result of the operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer(result.value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer` returns a deferred promise, whereas `when` returns a promise for the result of the operation.

DONE.
