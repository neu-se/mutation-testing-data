  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNotEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNotEqual` is the opposite of `isEqual`, so the condition would be satisfied if the two values are not equal, rather than if they are equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isLessThan
```
This would result in different behavior because `isLessThan` checks if the first value is less than the second value, rather than if they are equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGreaterThan
```
This would result in different behavior because `isGreaterThan` checks if the first value is greater than the second value, rather than if they are equal.

DONE.
