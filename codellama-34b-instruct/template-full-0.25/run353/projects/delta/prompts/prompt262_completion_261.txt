  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` is a different property than `attributes`, and it may not be present in the `thisOp` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp` is a different object than `thisOp`, and it may not have the same properties or values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler(embedType).compose(thisData, otherData, action === 'retain')
```
This would result in different behavior because `Delta.getHandler(embedType).compose` is a different function than `AttributeMap.diff`, and it may have different behavior or return different results.

DONE.
