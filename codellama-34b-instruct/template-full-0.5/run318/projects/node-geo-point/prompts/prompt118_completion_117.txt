  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by 2 would cause the distance to be doubled, which would lead to incorrect calculations in the `calculateDestination` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction by 1 would cause the distance to be reduced by 1 meter, which would lead to incorrect calculations in the `calculateDestination` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition by 1 would cause the distance to be increased by 1 meter, which would lead to incorrect calculations in the `calculateDestination` method.

DONE.
