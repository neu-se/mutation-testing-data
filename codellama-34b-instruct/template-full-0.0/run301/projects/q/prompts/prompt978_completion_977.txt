  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is not defined in the `defer` object, and the code would throw a `ReferenceError` when trying to access it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(deferred.promise));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method expects a promise as its argument, and passing `deferred.promise` would cause the `nodeArgs` array to contain a promise instead of a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(deferred.promise.then));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method expects a function as its argument, and passing `deferred.promise.then` would cause the `nodeArgs` array to contain a function
