  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, even if the promise is fulfilled or pending.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, even if the promise is rejected or pending.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, even if the promise is fulfilled or rejected.

DONE.
