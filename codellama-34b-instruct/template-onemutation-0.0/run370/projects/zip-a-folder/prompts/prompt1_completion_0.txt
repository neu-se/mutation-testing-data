  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression !== COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the compression level is equal to `COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed`, while the new code fragment checks if it is not equal to `COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed`. This change would cause the code to take a different branch in the `if` statement, potentially leading to different behavior.

DONE.
