Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()`, `reverse()`, and `join()` methods would reverse the order of the characters in the `baseUrlStr`, which could potentially change the URL and cause the `parse()` function to return a different result.

```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^https?:\/\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace()` method would remove the `http://` or `https://` protocol from the beginning of the `baseUrlStr`, which could potentially change the URL and cause the `parse()` function to return a
