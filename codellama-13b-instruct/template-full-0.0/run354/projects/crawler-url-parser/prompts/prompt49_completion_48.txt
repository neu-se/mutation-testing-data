  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve(parsedBaseUrl, parsedUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.resolve()` method returns a URL that is resolved against the base URL, whereas the original code fragment uses the `URL.parse()` method to parse the URL and then uses the `URL.format()` method to format the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.format(parsedBaseUrl, parsedUrl)
