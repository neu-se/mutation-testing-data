 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison would always return `false`, causing the `inverse` method to return `Complex['INFINITY']` regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` is a global function, and using it without the `this` keyword would reference the global object, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.re === 0 && this.im === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for exact equality of the real and imaginary parts, while the original `isZero` method might use a small epsilon value for comparison.

DONE.
