  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer` is a function that returns a new deferred object, while `Q.defer()` is a function call that returns a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` is a function call that returns a promise, while `Q.defer` is a function that returns a new deferred object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer().promise` is a promise that is resolved with the value of the deferred object, while `Q.defer` is a function that returns a new deferred object.

DONE.
