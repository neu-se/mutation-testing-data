  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisOp.insert === typeof otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the data types of the `insert` properties instead of their values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert !== otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the `insert` properties for inequality instead of equality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert === otherOp.insert && thisOp.attributes === otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also compare the `attributes` properties for equality in addition to the `insert` properties.

DONE.
