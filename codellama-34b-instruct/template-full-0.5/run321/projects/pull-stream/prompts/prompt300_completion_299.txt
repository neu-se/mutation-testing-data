  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `ended` is truthy, but this change would check if `ended` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && !test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `ended` is truthy, but this change would check if `ended` is truthy and `test(data)` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || !test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `ended` is truthy, but this change would check if `ended` is truthy or `test(data)` is falsy.

DONE.
