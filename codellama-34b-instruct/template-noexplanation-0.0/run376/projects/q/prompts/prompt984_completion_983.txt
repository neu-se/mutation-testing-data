  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This code fragment is different from the original `deferred.reject` because it will resolve the promise instead of rejecting it. This change will cause the promise to be fulfilled with the value `undefined`, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This code fragment is different from the original `deferred.reject` because it will notify the promise instead of rejecting it. This change will cause the promise to be notified with the value `undefined`, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This code fragment is different from the original `deferred.reject` because it will create a new node resolver instead of rejecting the promise. This change will cause the promise to be resolved with a new node resolver, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
