  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would start from the second argument instead of the third, which could cause the function to return a different array of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 3)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would start from the third argument instead of the second, which could cause the function to return a different array of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 4)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would start from the fourth argument instead of the second, which could cause the function to return a different array of arguments.

DONE.
