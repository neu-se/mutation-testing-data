  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[value]
```
This would result in different behavior because `value` is a different variable than `key`, and `value` is not guaranteed to be a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
["value"]
```
This would result in different behavior because `["value"]` is an array with a single element, whereas `key` is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value and cannot have properties, whereas `key` is a string and can have properties.

DONE.
