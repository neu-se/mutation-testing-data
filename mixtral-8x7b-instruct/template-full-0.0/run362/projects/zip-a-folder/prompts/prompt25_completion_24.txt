 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `archiverOptions` object would always be overwritten with an empty object, even if it was provided in the function arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
archiverOptions && archiverOptions
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a redundant check for the `archiverOptions` object, which already exists in the non-mutated code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.assign({}, archiverOptions)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of the `archiverOptions` object, which might not behave the same as the original object in certain situations.

DONE.
