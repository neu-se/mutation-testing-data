  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof "bootstrap" === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat the string "bootstrap" as a function, which it is not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat the global object window as a function, which it is not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof qStartingLine === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat the variable qStartingLine (which is a number) as a function, which would cause an error.

DONE.
