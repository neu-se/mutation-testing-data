  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the `otherIter.peekLength()` to return a value that is one greater than the actual length of the peeked operation, which would cause the `diffResult.forEach()` loop to iterate one more time than it should, potentially resulting in an infinite loop or other unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the `otherIter.peekLength()` to return a value that is one less than the actual length of the peeked operation, which would cause the `diffResult.forEach()` loop to iterate one fewer times than it should, potentially resulting in an infinite loop or other unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different
