  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This change will cause the `cb` function to be called with `undefined` as the first argument, which is different from the original code where `null` was passed. This change may cause the test suite to fail if the `cb` function is not designed to handle `undefined` values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This change will cause the `cb` function to be called with `0` as the first argument, which is different from the original code where `null` was passed. This change may cause the test suite to fail if the `cb` function is not designed to handle `0` values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This change will cause the `cb` function to be called with an empty string as the first argument, which is different from the original code where `null` was passed. This change may cause the test suite to fail if the `cb` function is not designed to handle empty strings.
