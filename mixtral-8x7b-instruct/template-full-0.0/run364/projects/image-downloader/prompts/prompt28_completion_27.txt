 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http' === url.substring(0, 4)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the URL starts with 'http' instead of using the `startsWith` method and `trimLeft` to remove leading whitespaces. This could cause issues when the URL actually starts with 'https' but the comparison returns false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.indexOf('https') === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if 'https' is at the beginning of the URL string using the `indexOf` method instead of using the `startsWith` method. This could cause issues when the URL starts with 'https' but the comparison returns -1 (not found).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!url.includes(' ') && url.startsWith('https')
