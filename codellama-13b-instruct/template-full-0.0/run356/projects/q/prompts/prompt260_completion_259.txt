  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` function would not be called, and the promise would remain in a pending state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` function would be called with a null value, which would resolve the promise to a rejected state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"test"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` function would be called with a string value, which would resolve the promise to a fulfilled state.

DONE.
