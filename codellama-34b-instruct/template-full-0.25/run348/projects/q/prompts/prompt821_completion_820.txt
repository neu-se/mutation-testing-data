  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.reject()` method returns a promise that is rejected, whereas the original code fragment `Q` returns a promise that is resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.resolve()` method returns a promise that is resolved, whereas the original code fragment `Q` returns a promise that is rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.defer()` method returns a deferred object, whereas the original code fragment `Q` returns a promise.

DONE.
