  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the value is false, but by replacing it with true, the check would always pass, even if the value is actually false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the value is false, but by replacing it with null, the check would always fail, even if the value is actually false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the value is false, but by replacing it with undefined, the check would always fail, even if the value is actually false.

DONE.
