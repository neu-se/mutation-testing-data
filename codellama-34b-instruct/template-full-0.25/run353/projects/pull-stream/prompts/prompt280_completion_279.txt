  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operation would change the result of the `mapper` function, potentially causing the `map` function to return a different value than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operation would change the result of the `mapper` function, potentially causing the `map` function to return a different value than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper(data) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operation would change the result of the `mapper` function, potentially causing the `map` function to return a different value than expected.

DONE.
