  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 - r
```
This would result in different behavior because the `acos` function returns the arccosine of a value between -1 and 1, while the `1 - r` expression would return a value between 0 and 2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * r
```
This would result in different behavior because the `acos` function returns a value between 0 and 1, while the `2 * r` expression would return a value between 0 and 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r * r
```
This would result in different behavior because the `acos` function returns a value between 0 and 1, while the `r * r` expression would return a value between 0 and 1.

DONE.
