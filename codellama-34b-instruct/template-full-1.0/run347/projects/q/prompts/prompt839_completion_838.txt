  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a "void" type, which means it is not a type that can be used in most operations. In contrast, `true` is a boolean value that can be used in logical operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a "void" type, which means it is not a type that can be used in most operations. In contrast, `null` is a value that can be used in almost all operations, including logical operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!false
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a "void" type, which means it is not a type that can be used in most operations. In contrast, `!false` is a boolean value that can be used in logical operations.

DONE.
