  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset = 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `offset` property would be set to 1 instead of 0, which would cause the `next` method to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index = 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` property would be set to 1 instead of 0, which would cause the `next` method to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops = [];
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ops` property would be set to an empty array instead of the original array, which would cause the `next` method to return a different value.

DONE.
