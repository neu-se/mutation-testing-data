  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink(source)
```
This would result in different behavior because the "source" function would be called with the wrong number of arguments. The original code passes the "data" argument to the "sink" function, while this option passes the "source" function itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink(acc)
```
This would result in different behavior because the "acc" variable is a different value than the "data" variable that is passed to the "sink" function in the original code. This option would pass a different value to the "sink" function, which could cause it to produce different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the "sink" function expects to receive a non-null value as its first argument. By passing null, the function would not receive the expected value, which could cause it to produce different output.

DONE.
