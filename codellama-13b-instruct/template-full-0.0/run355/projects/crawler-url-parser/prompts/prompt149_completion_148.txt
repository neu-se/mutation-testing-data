  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split("/").filter(function (elem, index, array) {
	return elem.length > 0
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `split` method to split the `pageurl_path` string into an array of substrings, and then filters out any empty strings. The new code fragment uses the `filter` method to filter out any empty strings from the array of substrings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split("/").map(function (elem, index, array) {
	return elem.length > 0 ? elem : "";
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `split` method to split the `pageurl_path` string into an array of substrings, and then filters out any empty strings. The new code fragment uses the `map` method to map each substring to an empty string if its length is 0, or to the substring itself if its length is
