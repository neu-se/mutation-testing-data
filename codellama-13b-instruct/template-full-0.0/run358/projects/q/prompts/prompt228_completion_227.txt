  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.push(args);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `defer` function to always return a promise that is resolved with the value of the `args` array, regardless of whether the `resolve` function is called with a value or a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.push(args[0]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `defer` function to always return a promise that is resolved with the first element of the `args` array, regardless of whether the `resolve` function is called with a value or a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.push(args[1]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `defer` function to always return a promise that is resolved with the second element of the `args` array, regardless of whether the `resolve` function is called with a value or a rejected promise.
