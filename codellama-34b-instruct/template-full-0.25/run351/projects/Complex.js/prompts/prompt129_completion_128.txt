  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return `Complex.INFINITY`, regardless of the input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return `Complex.NAN`, regardless of the input values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']() || z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return `Complex.INFINITY` if the divisor is zero, regardless of the input values.

DONE.
