  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would be called with the `"get"` event instead of the `"post"` event, which would likely cause the method to fail or return an unexpected result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would be called without any event name, which would likely cause an error or undefined behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"postSubject"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would be called with a different event name, which would likely cause the method to fail or return an unexpected result.

DONE.
