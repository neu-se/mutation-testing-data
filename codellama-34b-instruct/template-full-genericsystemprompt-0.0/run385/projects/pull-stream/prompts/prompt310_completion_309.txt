  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the result of the `test` function, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when the `test` function returns a truthy value, and `false` when it returns a falsy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function would be called with the `data` argument, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when the `test` function returns a truthy value, and `false` when it returns a falsy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data) && data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function would be called with the `data` argument, and the result of the `test` function would be ANDed with the `data` argument. This would cause
