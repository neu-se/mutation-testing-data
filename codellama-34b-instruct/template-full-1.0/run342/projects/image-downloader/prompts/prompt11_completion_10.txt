  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.extname
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.extname` returns the file extension of a given path, while `path.basename` returns the file name without the extension.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname` returns the directory name of a given path, while `path.basename` returns the file name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.parse(options.dest).ext
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.parse` returns an object with various properties of the path, including the extension, while `path.extname` returns the extension of a given path.

DONE.
