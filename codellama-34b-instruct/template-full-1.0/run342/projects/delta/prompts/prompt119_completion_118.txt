  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment increments the variable `elem` by 1, but this change would increment it by 2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment increments the variable `elem` by 1, but this change would multiply it by 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment increments the variable `elem` by 1, but this change would decrement it by 2.

DONE.
