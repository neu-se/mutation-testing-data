Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the loop to execute one additional time, potentially leading to an attempt to access an undefined argument, which could cause runtime errors or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to skip the last argument, meaning that the last function or object intended to be processed would not be applied, potentially altering the output of the `pull` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop condition would always evaluate to false, causing the loop to never execute, which means none of the arguments would be processed, and the function would return the original `read` value unchanged.

DONE.
