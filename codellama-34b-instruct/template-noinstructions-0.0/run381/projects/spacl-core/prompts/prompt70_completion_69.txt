  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is case-sensitive, while the replacement code fragment is not. This could cause the policy to allow actions that it should not, or deny actions that it should.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking the entire path, while the replacement code fragment is only checking the last segment of the path. This could cause the policy to allow actions that it should not, or deny actions that it should.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.replace(/\//g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking the path as-is, while the replacement code fragment is removing all forward slashes from the path. This could cause the policy to allow actions that it should not, or deny actions that it should.

DONE.
