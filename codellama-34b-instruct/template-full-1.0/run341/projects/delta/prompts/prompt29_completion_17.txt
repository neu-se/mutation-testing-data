  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseInverted
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseInverted` object is not defined in the scope of the `invert` function. The `baseInverted` object is defined in the scope of the `diff` function, and the `invert` function does not have access to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a` object is not defined in the scope of the `invert` function. The `a` object is defined in the scope of the `compose` function, and the `invert` function does not have access to it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` keyword refers to the current object, which in this case is the `AttributeMap` object. The `AttributeMap` object does not have a `base` property, and therefore the code would throw an error.
