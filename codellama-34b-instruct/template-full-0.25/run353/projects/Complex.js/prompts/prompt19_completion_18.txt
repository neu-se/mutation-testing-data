  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is a variable that is already defined in the function, and it has a different value than `y`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` is a variable that is already defined in the function, and it has a different value than `y`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This would result in different behavior because `x` is a variable that is already defined in the function, and it has a different value than `y`.

DONE.
