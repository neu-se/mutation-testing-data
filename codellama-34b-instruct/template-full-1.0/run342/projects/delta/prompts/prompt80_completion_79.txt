  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!lastOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true` when `lastOp` is an object. Therefore, it would insert the new operation at the beginning of the operations array even if `lastOp` has non-zero length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to the number of elements deleted by the last operation, regardless of whether `lastOp` is an object or not. Therefore, it would insert the new operation after the last operation if the last operation has non-zero length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to the number of elements retained by the last operation, regardless of whether `lastOp` is an object or not. Therefore, it would insert the new operation after the last operation if the last operation has non-zero length.

DONE.
