  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-id
```
This would result in a negative ID value, which is different from the original ID value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id+1
```
This would result in an ID value that is one greater than the original ID value, which could potentially lead to unexpected behavior if the ID is used as an index or key in a data structure.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"id"
```
This would result in a string value "id" instead of an ID number, which could potentially cause errors or unexpected behavior in the rest of the program.

DONE.
