  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.nbind.apply(void 0, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nbind.apply(void 0, args)` is a different function call than `Q.nbind.apply(this, args)`. The former calls the `Q.nbind` function with the `void 0` object as the `this` context, while the latter calls it with the `this` object as the `this` context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.nbind.apply(this, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nbind.apply(this, args)` is a different function call than `Q.nbind.apply(void 0, args)`. The former calls the `Q.nbind` function with the `this` object as the `this` context, while the latter calls it with the `void 0` object as the `this` context.
