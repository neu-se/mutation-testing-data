Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(e);
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of handling the error through a global error handler, it simply logs the error to the console, which may lead to unhandled promise rejections and a lack of proper error management.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Custom error");
```
This would result in different behavior because it throws a new custom error instead of invoking the global error handler, which could disrupt the promise chain and lead to unexpected results in the application.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the global error handler to null, effectively disabling any error handling for unhandled promise rejections, which could cause the application to fail silently without any error reporting.

DONE.
