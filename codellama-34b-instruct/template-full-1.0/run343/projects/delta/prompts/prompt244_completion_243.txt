  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `otherIter.next()` function is not being called with the correct arguments. The `length` variable is not defined in the provided code, so this replacement would result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete(opLength)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delta.delete()` function is not being called with the correct arguments. The `opLength` variable is not defined in the provided code, so this replacement would result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.delete(opLength)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `newOp.delete()` function is not being called with the correct arguments. The `opLength` variable is not defined in the provided code, so this replacement would result in an error.

DONE.
