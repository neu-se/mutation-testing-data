  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment references the attributes of the base operation, while this modified code fragment references the length of the base operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment references the attributes of the base operation, while this modified code fragment references the attributes of the other operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment references the attributes of the base operation, while this modified code fragment replaces the attributes with null.

DONE.
