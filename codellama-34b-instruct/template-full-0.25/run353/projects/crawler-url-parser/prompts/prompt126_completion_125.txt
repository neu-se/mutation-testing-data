  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(linkurl.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function is called on the `linkurl.url` property, which is a string, instead of the `linkurl` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.url.parse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function is called on the `url` property of the `linkurl` object, which is a string, instead of the `linkurl` object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.url.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` function is called on the `url` property of the `linkurl` object, which is a string, and the `pop` function is called on the resulting array to extract the last element, which is a string.

DONE.
