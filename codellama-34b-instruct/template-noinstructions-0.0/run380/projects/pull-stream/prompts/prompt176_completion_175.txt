  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.slice()` creates a shallow copy of the array, while `array` is the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.concat()` creates a new array by concatenating the elements of the original array, while `array` is the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.map(function(x) { return x * 2; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.map()` creates a new array by applying a function to each element of the original array, while `array` is the original array.

DONE.
