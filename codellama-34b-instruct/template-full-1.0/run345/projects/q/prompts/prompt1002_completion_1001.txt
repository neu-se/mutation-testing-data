  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"send"
```
This would result in different behavior because `dispatch` expects the first argument to be a string representing the method to invoke, but `"send"` is not a valid method on the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"foo"` is not a valid method on the object, and `dispatch` would throw a `TypeError` if it received an unknown method name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `dispatch` would throw a `TypeError` if it received a null or undefined method name.

DONE.
