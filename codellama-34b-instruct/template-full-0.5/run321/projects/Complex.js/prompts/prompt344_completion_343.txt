  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` returns the imaginary part of the complex number, while the modified code fragment `b + 1` returns the imaginary part plus one. This change would cause the function to return a different value, which could affect the results of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` returns the imaginary part of the complex number, while the modified code fragment `b * 2` returns twice the imaginary part. This change would cause the function to return a different value, which could affect the results of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` returns the imaginary part of the complex number, while the modified code fragment `b / 2` returns half the imaginary part. This
