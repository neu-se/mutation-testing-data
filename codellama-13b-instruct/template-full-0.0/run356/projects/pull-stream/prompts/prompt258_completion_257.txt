  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would always evaluate to `false`, causing the `nextChunk` function to be called even when there is an error. This could lead to unexpected behavior and bugs in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would always evaluate to `true`, causing the `nextStream` function to be called even when there is an error. This could lead to unexpected behavior and bugs in the code.
