  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `error`, which would throw an error if the promise was rejected. Replacing it with `null` would result in a resolved promise with a value of `null`, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `error`, which would throw an error if the promise was rejected. Replacing it with `undefined` would result in a resolved promise with a value of `undefined`, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"ERROR"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `error`, which would throw an error if the promise was rejected. Replacing it with a string would result in a resolved promise with a value of the string, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
