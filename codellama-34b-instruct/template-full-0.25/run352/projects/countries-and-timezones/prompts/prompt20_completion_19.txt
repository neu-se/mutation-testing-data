  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `timezone` variable is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if it is strictly equal to `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!timezone.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `timezone` variable is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if it has a length of 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `timezone` variable is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if it has a length of 0.

DONE.
