  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, true, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function would be called with a `true` value for the `abort` parameter, which would cause the callback to be called with an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, null, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function would be called with a `null` value for the `abort` parameter, which would cause the callback to be called with a success value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, undefined, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function would be called with an `undefined` value for the `abort` parameter, which would cause the callback to be called with an error.

DONE.
