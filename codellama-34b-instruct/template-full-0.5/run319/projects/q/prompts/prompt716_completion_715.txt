  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.bind(this)` creates a new function that is bound to the original `this` context, whereas `this.dispatch` would lose the original `this` context when the function is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.call(this)` calls the `dispatch` method with `this` as the context, whereas `this.dispatch` would lose the original `this` context when the function is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.apply(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.apply(this)` calls the `dispatch` method with `this` as the context, whereas `this.dispatch` would lose the original `this` context when the function is called.

DONE.
