 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateBearing` method would always return 0, regardless of the input `point`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new GeoPoint(0, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateBearing` method would always return the bearing from the initial `GeoPoint` with latitude and longitude equal to 0, regardless of the input `point`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateBearing` method would return a random bearing, instead of the actual bearing between the two points.

DONE.
