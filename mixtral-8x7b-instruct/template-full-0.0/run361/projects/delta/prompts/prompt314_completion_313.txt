 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
inverted.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `inverted.delete` removes an operation from the delta, while `inverted.retain` would keep the operation in the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
inverted.push
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `inverted.delete` adds the operation to the delta, while `inverted.push` would insert the operation at the end of the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
inverted['noSuchMethod']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `inverted.delete` is a valid method of the `inverted` object, while `inverted['noSuchMethod']` would throw a `TypeError` as it tries to access a non-existent method.

DONE.
