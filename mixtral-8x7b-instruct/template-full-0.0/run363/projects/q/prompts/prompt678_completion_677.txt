 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.prototype.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `dispatch` method from the `Object.prototype` instead of the `Q` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Math.random` function, which is not related to the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.all
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `all` method from the `Q` object, which has a different purpose than the `dispatch` method.

DONE.
