  Sure, I can help you with that! Here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with code fragments that have different behavior than the original code:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && end == true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is first checked against the value `true`, and only if it is equal to `true` is the `done` callback invoked. In the original code, the `done` callback is invoked if `end` is truthy, but not necessarily equal to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end != null && end !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is first checked against `null`, and only if it is not `null` is it checked against `true`. In the original code, the `end` variable is only checked against `true`, and not against `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && (end !== true || end !== false)
```
