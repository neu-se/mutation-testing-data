  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb(null, data)` would call the callback function with the `data` argument, while the original code fragment `cb` would call the callback function without any arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb(err, null)` would call the callback function with the `err` and `null` arguments, while the original code fragment `cb` would call the callback function with only the `err` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb(err, data)` would call the callback function with the `err` and `data` arguments, while the original code fragment `cb` would call the callback function with only the `err` argument.

DONE.
