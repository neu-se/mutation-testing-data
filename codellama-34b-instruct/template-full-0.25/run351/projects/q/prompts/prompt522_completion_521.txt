  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that is not an instance of `Error`, and it would not cause the `reject` function to be called with an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that is not an instance of `Error`, and it would not cause the `reject` function to be called with an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because `new Error()` creates a new error object, which would cause the `reject` function to be called with an error.

DONE.
