  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush()
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush` is a function that is not defined in the code snippet, so it would cause a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` is a function that schedules a function to be executed after a certain amount of time, but the second argument is `0`, which means the function will be executed immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setImmediate(flush)
```
This would result in different behavior because `setImmediate` is a function that schedules a function to be executed as soon as possible, but it is not supported in all browsers.

DONE.
