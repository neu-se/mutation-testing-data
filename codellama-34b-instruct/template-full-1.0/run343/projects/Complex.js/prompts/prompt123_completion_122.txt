  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a === b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the real and imaginary parts of the complex numbers are equal, rather than checking if the imaginary part of the first number is equal to the real part of the second number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a !== b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the real and imaginary parts of the complex numbers are not equal, rather than checking if the imaginary part of the first number is not equal to the real part of the second number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a + b === 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the sum of the real and imaginary parts of the complex numbers is equal to zero, rather than checking if the imaginary part of the first number is equal to the real part of the second number.

DONE.
