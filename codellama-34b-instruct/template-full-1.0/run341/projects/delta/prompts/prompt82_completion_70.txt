  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the while loop would not execute even once, as the condition `index < end` would always be false when `end` is less than or equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the while loop would not execute even once, as the condition `iter.hasNext()` would always be false when `iter` is null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the while loop would not execute even once, as the condition `iter.hasNext()` would always be false when `iter` is undefined.

DONE.
