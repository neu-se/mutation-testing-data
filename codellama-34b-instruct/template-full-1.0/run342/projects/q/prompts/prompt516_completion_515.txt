  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.catch(Q.reject)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch` method is not called on the original promise, which could lead to differences in error handling.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(Q.fulfill)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is not called on the original promise, which could lead to differences in the resolution of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { throw Error("injected error"); })
```
This would result in different behavior because the function passed to `then` would throw an error, which would cause the promise to be rejected, regardless of the outcome of the original promise.

DONE.
