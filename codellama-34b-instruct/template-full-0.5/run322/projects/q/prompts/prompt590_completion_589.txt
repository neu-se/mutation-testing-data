  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a bound `this` value, and `null` is used as the `this` value, which would cause the function to be called with a different context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` calls the function with a specified `this` value and arguments provided individually, and `null` is used as the `this` value, which would cause the function to be called with a different context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` calls the function with a specified `this` value and arguments provided as an array, and `null` is used as the `this` value, which would cause the function to be called with a different context.

DONE.
