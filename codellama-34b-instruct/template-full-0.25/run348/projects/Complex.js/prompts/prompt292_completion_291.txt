  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would change the value of `a`, which is used in the calculation of the `cos` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would change the value of `b`, which is used in the calculation of the `sin` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* b` would change the value of `a`, which is used in the calculation of the `cos` function, and the `a * b` would change the value of `b`, which is used in the calculation of the `sin` function.

DONE.
