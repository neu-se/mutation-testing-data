  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a value that is distinct from `null`, and could potentially cause the `drain` function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because `false` is a value that is distinct from `null`, and could potentially cause the `drain` function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because `''` (an empty string) is a value that is distinct from `null`, and could potentially cause the `drain` function to behave differently.

DONE.
