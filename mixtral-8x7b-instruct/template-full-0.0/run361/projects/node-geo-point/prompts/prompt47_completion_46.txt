 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use a latitude value of 0 for the calculation, regardless of the actual value of point1.latitude.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a random number as the latitude value for the calculation, instead of the actual value of point1.latitude.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the longitude value instead of the latitude value for the calculation, which would affect the accuracy of the calculation.

DONE.
