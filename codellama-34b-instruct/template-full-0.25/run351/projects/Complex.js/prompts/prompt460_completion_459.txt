  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(a) <= Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a strict inequality comparison, while this code uses a non-strict inequality comparison. This means that the original code would only return `true` if `a` is strictly less than `Complex['EPSILON']`, while this code would return `true` if `a` is less than or equal to `Complex['EPSILON']`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(a) > Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a strict inequality comparison, while this code uses a non-strict inequality comparison. This means that the original code would only return `true` if `a` is strictly greater than `Complex['EPSILON']`, while this code would return `true` if `a` is greater than or equal to `Complex['EPSILON']`.
