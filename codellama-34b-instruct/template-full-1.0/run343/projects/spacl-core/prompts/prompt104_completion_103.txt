  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.has(name)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.has()` returns a boolean indicating whether the map has the specified key, whereas `this.get()` returns the value associated with the specified key. If the map has the specified key but the value is `undefined`, `this.get()` would return `undefined`, while `this.has()` would return `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.keys()` returns an iterable list of the keys in the map, while `this.get()` returns the value associated with the specified key. If the map contains the specified key but the value is `undefined`, `this.get()` would return `undefined`, while `this.keys()` would return an iterable list containing the key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.values()` returns an iter
