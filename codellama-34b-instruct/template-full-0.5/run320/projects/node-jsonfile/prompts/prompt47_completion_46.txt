  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"file" + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string, while the modified code fragment is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string, while the modified code fragment is a function call that returns a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string, while the modified code fragment is a function call that returns a substring of the original string.

DONE.
