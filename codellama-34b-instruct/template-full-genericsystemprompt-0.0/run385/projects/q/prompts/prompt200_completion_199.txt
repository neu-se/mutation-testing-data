  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.split
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to crash, as `e.stack` is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.split()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to crash, as `e.stack` is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.split(" ")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to crash, as `e.stack` is not defined.

DONE.
