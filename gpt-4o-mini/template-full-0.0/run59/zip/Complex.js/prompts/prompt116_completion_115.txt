Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `parse` function to treat the second argument as the value of `a` instead of `b`, potentially leading to incorrect calculations or unexpected results when creating the `Complex` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` as the second argument would likely lead to errors or unexpected behavior in the `parse` function, as it may not handle `null` correctly, resulting in incorrect initialization of the `Complex` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` as the second argument would also lead to potential errors or unexpected behavior in the `parse` function, similar to passing `null`, which could affect the creation of the `Complex` object and its properties.

DONE.
