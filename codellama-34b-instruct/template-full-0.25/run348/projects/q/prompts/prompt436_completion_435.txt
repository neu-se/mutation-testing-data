  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.includes(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` checks if the array contains the specified element, while `array_indexOf` checks if the element is present at a specific index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.indexOf(promise) !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` checks if the element is present at a specific index, while `includes` checks if the array contains the specified element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!unhandledRejections.includes(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` checks if the array contains the specified element, while `!includes` checks if the array does not contain the specified element.

DONE.
