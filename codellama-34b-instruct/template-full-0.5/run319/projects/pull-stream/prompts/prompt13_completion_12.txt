  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would increment by 2 instead of 1, potentially skipping over some elements in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would decrement instead of incrementing, potentially causing an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i *= 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would multiply the index by 2 instead of incrementing it, potentially skipping over some elements in the array.

DONE.
