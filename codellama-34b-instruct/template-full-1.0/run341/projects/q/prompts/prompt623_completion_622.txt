  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello", [key, value]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` method would receive a different argument list, which might not be handled correctly by the method's implementation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` method would receive a different argument list, which might not be handled correctly by the method's implementation. Additionally, this change could potentially cause the promise to be rejected or resolved with a different value than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` method would receive a different argument list, which might not be handled correctly by the method's implementation. Additionally, this change could potentially cause the promise to be resolved with a different value than expected.

DONE.
