  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method returns a new array containing the specified elements, whereas the `concat` method returns a new array containing the elements of the original array and the specified elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.splice
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method removes elements from an array and returns the removed elements, whereas the `concat` method returns a new array containing the elements of the original array and the specified elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.push
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array, whereas the `concat` method returns a new array containing the elements of the original array and the specified elements.

DONE.
