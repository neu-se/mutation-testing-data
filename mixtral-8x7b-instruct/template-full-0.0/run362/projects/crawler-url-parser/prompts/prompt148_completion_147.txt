 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"/."
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly split the path by treating any character after a "/" as a new part, even if it's not a valid path part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new RegExp("/")
