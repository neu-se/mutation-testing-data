  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `cb`, which would invoke the callback function, but `null` is a no-op and would not invoke the callback function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `cb`, which would invoke the callback function, but `undefined` is a no-op and would not invoke the callback function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `cb`, which would pass the callback function as an argument, but `cb()` would invoke the callback function immediately.

DONE.
