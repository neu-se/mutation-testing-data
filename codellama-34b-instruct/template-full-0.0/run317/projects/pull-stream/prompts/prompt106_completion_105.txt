  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `done` is a function that takes no arguments, while the new code fragment `done(null)` is a function call with an argument `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `done` is a function that takes no arguments, while the new code fragment `done(undefined)` is a function call with an argument `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `done` is a function that takes no arguments, while the new code fragment `done(new Error())` is a function call with an argument `new Error()`, which is an error object.

DONE.
