  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasNext()` is a method that returns a boolean indicating whether the iterator has more elements, whereas `hasNext` is a property that returns the next element in the iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `next()` is a method that advances the iterator to the next element and returns the current element, whereas `hasNext` is a property that returns the next element in the iteration without advancing the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek()` is a method that returns the next element in the iteration without advancing the iterator, whereas `hasNext` is a property that returns the next element in the iteration.

DONE.
