  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.delete(key, cbs);
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` would remove the key from the queue, whereas `set` would update the value associated with the key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because `clear` would remove all key-value pairs from the queue, whereas `set` would update the value associated with a specific key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, []);
```
This would result in different behavior because `set` would update the value associated with the key to an empty array, whereas `delete` would remove the key from the queue.

DONE.
