  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const a = (point2.longitude - deg2rad(point1.longitude));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `deg2rad` to convert the longitude values to radians before doing the subtraction, but this replacement code fragment does not perform the conversion, which could cause the result to be incorrect if the longitude values are not already in radians.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const a = (point2.longitude - point1.longitude) * Math.PI / 180;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `deg2rad` to convert the longitude values to radians before doing the subtraction, but this replacement code fragment does not perform the conversion and instead uses a manual conversion factor of `Math.PI / 180`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const a = (point2.longitude - point1.longitude) *
