  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the `a` variable, which is used in the `Math.expm1` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of the `a` variable, which is used in the `Math.expm1` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would take the square root of the value of the `a` variable, which is used in the `Math.expm1` function.

DONE.
