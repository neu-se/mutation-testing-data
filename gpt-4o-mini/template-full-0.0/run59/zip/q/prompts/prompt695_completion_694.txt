Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be created with `null` instead of the intended `object`, leading to potential errors when trying to dispatch methods on a `null` reference.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be created with `undefined`, which may cause the dispatch method to fail or behave unexpectedly, as it would not have a valid object to operate on.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"string"
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be created with a string instead of the intended object, which would likely lead to type errors when attempting to call methods that expect an object.

DONE.
