  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(b).concat(Object.keys(a))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method would combine the keys of both objects, whereas the original code fragment only used the keys of the `b` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(a).concat(Object.keys(b))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method would combine the keys of both objects in a different order, which could affect the outcome of the `reduce` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(b).filter(key => a[key] === undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method would only include keys from the `b` object that are not present in the `a` object, whereas the original code fragment included all keys from both objects.

DONE.
