  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property would be set to `null`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` and the `else` block to be executed, resulting in a different outcome.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property would be set to `0`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` and the `then` block to be executed, resulting in a different outcome.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property would be set to `undefined`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` and the `else` block to be executed, resulting in a different outcome.

DONE.
