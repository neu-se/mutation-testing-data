  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, whereas `void 0` is a keyword that evaluates to `undefined`. In the context of the code, `null` would cause the `apply` method to be called with `null` as the `this` value, whereas `void 0` would cause it to be called with `undefined` as the `this` value.

DONE.
