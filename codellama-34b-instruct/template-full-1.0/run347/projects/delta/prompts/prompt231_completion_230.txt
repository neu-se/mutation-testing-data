  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.length` returns the number of operations in the other iterator, while `otherIter.peekLength()` returns the length of the operation to be returned by the iterator's `next()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[1].length
```
This would result in different behavior because `strings[1].length` returns the length of the string in the second position of the `strings` array, while `otherIter.peekLength()` returns the length of the operation to be returned by the iterator's `next()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.length` returns the number of operations in the this iterator, while `otherIter.peekLength()` returns the length of the operation to be returned by the iterator's `next()` method.

DONE.
