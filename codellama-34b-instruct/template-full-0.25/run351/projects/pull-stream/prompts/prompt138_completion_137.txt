  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb(end)` would call the callback function with the `end` value as an argument, while the original code fragment `cb` would call the callback function with no arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, generate() + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb(null, generate() + 1)` would call the callback function with the generated value plus 1 as an argument, while the original code fragment `cb(null, generate())` would call the callback function with the generated value as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, generate())
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb(null, generate())` would call the callback function with the generated value as an argument, while the original code fragment `cb` would call the callback function with no arguments.

DONE.
