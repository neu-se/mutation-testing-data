  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_b
```
This would result in different behavior because `_b` is the absolute value of `b`, while `_a` is the absolute value of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_b * _b
```
This would result in different behavior because `_b * _b` is the square of `_b`, while `_a` is the absolute value of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a * _b
```
This would result in different behavior because `_a * _b` is the product of `_a` and `_b`, while `_a` is the absolute value of `a`.

DONE.
