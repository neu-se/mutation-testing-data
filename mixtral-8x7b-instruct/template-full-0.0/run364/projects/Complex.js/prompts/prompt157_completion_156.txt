 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the check for dividing by zero would not account for the case where the divisor's real part is zero but the imaginary part is not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 'NAN' when dividing by zero, even if the dividend is also zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
z.isZero()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the 'isZero' method on the 'z' object, which might not exist or have different behavior than the 'isZero' function used in the original code.

DONE.
