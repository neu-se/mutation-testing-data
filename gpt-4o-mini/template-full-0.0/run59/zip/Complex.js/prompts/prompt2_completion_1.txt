Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the input value, which would change the output of the `cosh` function for small values of `x`, leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the input value by 2, which would significantly alter the output of the `cosh` function, especially for larger values of `x`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the input with the sine of `x`, which is a completely different mathematical function and would yield incorrect results for the `cosh` function.

DONE.
