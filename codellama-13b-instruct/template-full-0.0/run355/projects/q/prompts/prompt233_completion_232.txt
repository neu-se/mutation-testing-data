  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch.apply(resolvedPromise, arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is used to call the `promiseDispatch` method on the `resolvedPromise` object, which is not the same as the original code fragment. This could potentially cause the promise to be resolved with a different value or cause the promise to be rejected with a different reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch.call(resolvedPromise, arguments);
