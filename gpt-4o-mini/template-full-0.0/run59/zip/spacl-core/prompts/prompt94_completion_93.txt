Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.id
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the key used to store the policy in the map from the policy's name to its id, which may not be unique or relevant for the intended lookup.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it alters the key to be the uppercase version of the policy's name, potentially causing mismatches when querying for policies with names that differ only in case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name + '_policy'
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends a suffix to the policy's name, leading to a different key being used in the map, which would prevent the original policy from being retrieved correctly.

DONE.
