  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes != null &&
      typeof attributes === 'function' &&
      Object.keys(attributes).length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is checking if `attributes` is a function, instead of an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes != null &&
      typeof attributes === 'object' &&
      Object.keys(attributes).length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is checking if `attributes` is an object with no properties, instead of checking if it has properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes != null &&
      typeof attributes === 'object' &&
      Object.keys(attributes).length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is checking if `attributes` is an object with negative properties, which is impossible.

DONE.
