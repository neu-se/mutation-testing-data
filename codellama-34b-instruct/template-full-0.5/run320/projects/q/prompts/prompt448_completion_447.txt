  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` removes the last element of an array, whereas `push()` adds an element to the end of an array. This change would cause the array `unhandledRejections` to be modified in a different way than the original code, which could potentially lead to different behavior in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.push(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because `unhandledReasons` is an array of strings, whereas `unhandledRejections` is an array of promises. This change would cause the program to store the reason for a rejection in a different data structure than the original code, which could potentially lead to different behavior in the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.push(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `reportedUnhandledRe
