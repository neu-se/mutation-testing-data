  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "next")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method would be called on the `continuer` function, which would create a new function that is bound to the `continuer` function. This would cause the `continuer` function to be called with the `next` argument, which would result in a different behavior than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method would be called on the `continuer` function, which would create a new function that is bound to the `continuer` function. This would cause the `continuer` function to be called with the `throw` argument, which would result in a different behavior than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "
