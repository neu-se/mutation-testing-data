  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 0 || !isNaN(c)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the presence of a number in the string, while this replacement checks for the absence of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 0 || c === ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the presence of a number in the string, while this replacement checks for the presence of a space character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 0 || c === 'i'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the presence of a number in the string, while this replacement checks for the presence of the letter 'i'.

DONE.
