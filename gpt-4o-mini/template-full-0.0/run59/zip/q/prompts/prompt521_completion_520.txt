Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly resolve the promise instead of rejecting it, leading to unhandled promise rejections not being tracked properly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the notify method instead of rejecting the promise, which is not the intended action for handling exceptions, potentially causing confusion in promise state management.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject("Error occurred")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with a specific error message instead of the original exception, which could lead to loss of the original error context and make debugging more difficult.

DONE.
