  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "undefined" && typeof self !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is used instead of `||`, which means that both conditions must be true for the expression to be true. In the original code, only one condition needs to be true for the expression to be true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window === "undefined" || typeof self === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator is used instead of `!==`, which means that the expression will be true if both conditions are false. In the original code, the expression will be true if either condition is false.
