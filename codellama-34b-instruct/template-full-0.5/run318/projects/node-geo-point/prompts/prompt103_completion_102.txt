  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 + π
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the longitude of the destination point using the bearing and distance from the starting point, while the mutated code adds π to the longitude, which would result in a completely different destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 + Math.random() * 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the longitude of the destination point using the bearing and distance from the starting point, while the mutated code adds a random value between 0 and 360 to the longitude, which would result in a different destination point each time the function is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the longitude of the destination point using the bearing and distance from the starting point, while the mutated code adds 180 to the longitude, which would
