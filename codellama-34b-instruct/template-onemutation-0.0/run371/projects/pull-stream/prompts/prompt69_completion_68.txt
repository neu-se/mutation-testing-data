  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
doneLackingErr.message
```
This would result in different behavior because `doneLackingErr` is an `Error` object, and `doneLackingErr.message` is a string that contains the error message. In the original code, `doneLackingErr` is passed as an argument to `console.warn()`, which expects a string. By using `doneLackingErr.message`, we are passing a string to `console.warn()`, which is the expected behavior.

DONE.
