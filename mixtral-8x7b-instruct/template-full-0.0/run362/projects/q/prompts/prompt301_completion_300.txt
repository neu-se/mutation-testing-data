 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[[this, that]]
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps the array in an additional array, changing the structure of the returned value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[null, that]
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `this` reference with `null`, potentially causing issues if the returned array is used to access methods or properties of `this`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[that, this]
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the order of the elements in the array, which could cause issues if the order is significant for the code consuming the returned array.

DONE.
