  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete(key);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets the value at the specified key to the given value, while this replacement code fragment deletes the key-value pair from the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, val + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets the value at the specified key to the given value, while this replacement code fragment sets the value to the given value plus 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, val * 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets the value at the specified key to the given value, while this replacement code fragment sets the value to the given value multiplied by 2.

DONE.
