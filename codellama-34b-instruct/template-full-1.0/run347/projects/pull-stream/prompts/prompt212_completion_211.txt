  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `null`. This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `abortCb` function, which may have been intended to execute asynchronously. However, replacing it with `null` would cause the `next` function to return immediately without executing any asynchronous code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `abortCb()`. This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `abortCb` is a function before calling it. Replacing it with `abortCb()` would result in the function being called unconditionally, which may cause errors if `abortCb` is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `abortCb;`. This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a semicolon (`;`) to indicate the end of the `abortCb` call, whereas this code fragment does not. This could potentially cause the `next` function to return the wrong value or behave differently in other ways.

DONE.
