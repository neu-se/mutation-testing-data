 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"".split(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `split` method with no arguments, which splits a string into an array of substrings based on the position of the `separator` (an empty string in this case). Replacing it with `split(undefined)` would cause the code to split the string based on the position of the `undefined` value, which would result in a different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"hello world".split(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `split` method with no arguments, while the modified code uses `split` with an argument of `1`, which splits the string into an array of substrings based on the position of the `separator` (in this case, the number `1`). This would result in a different behavior compared to the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
