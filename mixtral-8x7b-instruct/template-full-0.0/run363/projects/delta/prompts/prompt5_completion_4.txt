 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
attributes[key] !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the new condition checks if the value is not equal to null, instead of just checking if the value is not null or undefined. This could cause some attributes to be removed when they should have been kept.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
!Array.isArray(attributes[key])
```
This would result in different behavior because the new condition checks if the value is not an array, and if it is, it removes the key-value pair from the attributes object. This could cause unexpected behavior when working with attribute maps that contain arrays.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
keepNull === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the new condition directly checks if `keepNull` is equal to `false`, instead of checking if it is falsy. This could cause the function to behave differently depending on the initial value of `keepNull`, even if it
