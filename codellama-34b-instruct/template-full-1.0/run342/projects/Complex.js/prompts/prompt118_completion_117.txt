  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-this['abs']
```
This would result in different behavior because the unary minus operator will invert the sign of the value, potentially leading to a different result in calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['abs'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operator will increase the value by a factor of 2, potentially leading to a different result in calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['abs'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition operator will increase the value by 1, potentially leading to a different result in calculation.

DONE.
