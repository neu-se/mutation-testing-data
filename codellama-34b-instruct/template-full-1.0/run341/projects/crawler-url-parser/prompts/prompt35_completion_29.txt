  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the case of the URL to lowercase, which could potentially cause issues with the URL parsing logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the characters in the URL, which could potentially cause issues with the URL parsing logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.split('').filter(function(char) { return char !== '/'; }).join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove all forward slashes from the URL, which could potentially cause issues with the URL parsing logic.

DONE.
