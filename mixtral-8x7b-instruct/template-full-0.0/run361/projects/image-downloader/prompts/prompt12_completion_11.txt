 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'./' + basename
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prepend './' to the `options.dest` value, changing the destination path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
path.basename(pathname)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the base name of the URL path instead of the original `options.url`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random().toString().slice(2)
