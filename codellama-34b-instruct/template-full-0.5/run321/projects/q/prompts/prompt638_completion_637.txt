  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would modify the value of `key` before it is passed as an argument to `dispatch`, which could potentially change the behavior of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the value of `key` to uppercase before it is passed as an argument to `dispatch`, which could potentially change the behavior of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + "1"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ "1"` operator would concatenate the value of `key` with the string `"1"` before it is passed as an argument to `dispatch`, which could potentially change the behavior of the function.

DONE.
