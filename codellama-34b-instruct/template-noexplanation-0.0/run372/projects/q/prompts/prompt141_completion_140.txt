  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p = p.source.slice()
```
This change will cause the loop to iterate over a copy of the `source` array, rather than the original array. This can be useful for testing the behavior of the loop when the array is modified during iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p = p.source.concat()
```
This change will cause the loop to iterate over a concatenation of the `source` array and an empty array. This can be useful for testing the behavior of the loop when the array is modified during iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p = p.source.filter(function() { return true; })
```
This change will cause the loop to iterate over a filtered version of the `source` array, where all elements are included. This can be useful for testing the behavior of the loop when the array is modified during iteration.

DONE.
