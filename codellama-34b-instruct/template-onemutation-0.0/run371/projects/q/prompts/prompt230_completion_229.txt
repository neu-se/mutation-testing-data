  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op === "when" && operands[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `operands` array has only two elements, and `operands[2]` would be `undefined`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `operands[1]` is a function.

DONE.
