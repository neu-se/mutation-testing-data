  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b + a * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of operations for multiplication is different, which could lead to a significant difference in the final result if the argument is very large.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the input parameters are not being used in the same way as before. The original code used both `a` and `b`, while the new code only uses `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the input parameters are not being used in the same way as before. The original code used both `a` and `b`, while the new code only uses `a`.

DONE.
