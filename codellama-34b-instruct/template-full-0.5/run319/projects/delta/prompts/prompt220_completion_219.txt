  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.insert` is not null, while this version checks if it is null. This change would cause the code to behave differently when `op.insert` is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.insert` is not null, while this version checks if it is not undefined. This change would cause the code to behave differently when `op.insert` is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!op.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.insert` is not null, while this version checks if it is falsy. This change would cause the code to behave differently when `op.insert` is falsy.

DONE.
