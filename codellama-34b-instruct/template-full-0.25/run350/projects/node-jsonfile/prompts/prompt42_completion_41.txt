  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stringify(obj, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because `stringify` is a function that takes two arguments, but the original code fragment only passes one argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(obj, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify` is a function that takes two arguments, but the original code fragment only passes one argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(obj)
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify` is a function that takes two arguments, but the original code fragment only passes one argument.

DONE.
