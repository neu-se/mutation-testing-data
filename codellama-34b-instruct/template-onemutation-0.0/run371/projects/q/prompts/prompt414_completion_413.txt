  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.then` is a function that returns a promise, whereas `object` is an object that does not have a `then` method. This would cause the `isPromiseAlike` function to return `false`, which would in turn cause the `nearer` function to return the original object instead of the fulfillment value.
