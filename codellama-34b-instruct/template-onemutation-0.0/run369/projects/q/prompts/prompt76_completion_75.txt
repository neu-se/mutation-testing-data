  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port2.postMessage(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code sends a message with value 0, while the mutated code sends a message with value 1. This could cause the receiving end of the message to behave differently, potentially leading to a different outcome in the program.
