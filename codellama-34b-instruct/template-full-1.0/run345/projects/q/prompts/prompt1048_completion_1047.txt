  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Q.resolve```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` returns a resolved promise, while `Q.reject` returns a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Q.reject("Error")```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` takes an argument, which is an error message or an error object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Q.reject(error)```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` returns a rejected promise, while `Q.resolve` returns a resolved promise.

DONE.
