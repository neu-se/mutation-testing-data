  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, cb || function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical OR operator to return a function that takes no arguments, while the replaced code fragment uses the bitwise OR operator to return a value that is always truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, cb && function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical OR operator to return a function that takes no arguments, while the replaced code fragment uses the bitwise AND operator to return a value that is always falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, cb ? function () {} : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical OR operator to return a function that takes no arguments, while the replaced code fragment uses the ternary operator to return a value that is either a function or null.

DONE.
