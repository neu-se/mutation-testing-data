  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.splice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` returns the removed elements, while `slice` returns a new array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes and returns the last element, while `slice` returns a new array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` removes and returns the first element, while `slice` returns a new array.

DONE.
