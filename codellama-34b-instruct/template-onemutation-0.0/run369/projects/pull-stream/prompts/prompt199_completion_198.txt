  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` would cause the `read` function to be called with an `abort` argument, which would then be passed to the `map` function. However, replacing `abort` with `null` would cause the `read` function to be called with a `null` argument, which would not be passed to the `map` function. This could potentially cause the `map` function to behave differently than expected.

DONE.
