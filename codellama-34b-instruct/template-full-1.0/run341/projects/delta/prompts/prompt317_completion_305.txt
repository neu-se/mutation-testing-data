  Okay, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER, along with a brief explanation of the differences in behavior:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```diff
-     retDelta.push(otherOp)
+     retDelta.push(otherOp).delete(opLength)
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `otherOp` is pushed onto the `retDelta` array as a separate operation, but in this modified code, it is pushed onto the `retDelta` array with a `delete` operation immediately following it. This would cause the `retDelta` array to be modified differently than it would have been had the original code been executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```diff
-     retDelta.push(otherOp)
+     retDelta.insert(otherOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `otherOp` is pushed onto the `retDelta` array as a separate operation, but in this modified code, it is inserted into the `retDelta`
