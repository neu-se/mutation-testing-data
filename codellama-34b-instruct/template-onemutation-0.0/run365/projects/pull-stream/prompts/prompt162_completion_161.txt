  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `true` when `value` is not null, while the new code fragment returns `false` in the same situation. This change would cause the test suite to fail if it relies on the original behavior.

DONE.
