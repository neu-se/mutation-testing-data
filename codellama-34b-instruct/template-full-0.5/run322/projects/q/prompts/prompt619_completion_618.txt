  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method is intended to retrieve the value of a property, while the `set` method is intended to set the value of a property. Using `set` instead of `get` would cause the `get` method to behave as if it were setting the value of the property, rather than retrieving it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method is intended to retrieve the value of a property, while the `delete` method is intended to delete the property. Using `delete` instead of `get` would cause the `get` method to behave as if it were deleting the property, rather than retrieving its value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [key, value]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method is intended to retrieve the value of a property
