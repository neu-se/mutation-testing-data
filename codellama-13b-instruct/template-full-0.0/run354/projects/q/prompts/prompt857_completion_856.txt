  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clearInterval
```
This would result in different behavior because `clearInterval` is used to clear an interval timer, while `clearTimeout` is used to clear a timeout timer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` is used to schedule a function to be called after a certain amount of time, while `clearTimeout` is used to cancel a timeout timer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setInterval
```
This would result in different behavior because `setInterval` is used to schedule a function to be called repeatedly at a certain interval, while `clearTimeout` is used to cancel a timeout timer.

DONE.
