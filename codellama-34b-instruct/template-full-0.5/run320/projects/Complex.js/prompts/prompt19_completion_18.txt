  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This would result in different behavior because `x` is a different variable than `y`, and the expression `x * x` would have a different value than `y * y`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is a different variable than `y`, and the expression `a * a` would have a different value than `y * y`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` is a different variable than `y`, and the expression `b * b` would have a different value than `y * y`.

DONE.
