  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a variable, while `data + 1` is an expression that adds 1 to the value of `data`. If the test case is checking for the exact value of `data`, it would fail when `data + 1` is used instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a variable, while `data.length` is a property access that returns the length of the array `data`. If the test case is checking for the exact value of `data`, it would fail when `data.length` is used instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a variable, while `data[0]` is an array access that returns the first element of the array `data`.
