  

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick = function () {
    setTimeout(flush, 1000);
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setTimeout` delay is increased by a factor of 10. Instead of executing immediately, the `flush` function will be called after 1 second, potentially causing a delay in the program's execution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick = function () {
    setTimeout(flush, 0);
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setTimeout` delay is reset to 0, potentially causing the `flush` function to be called more frequently than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick = function () {
    flush();
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setTimeout` function call is removed altogether, causing the `flush` function to be called immediately instead of after a delay.

DONE.
