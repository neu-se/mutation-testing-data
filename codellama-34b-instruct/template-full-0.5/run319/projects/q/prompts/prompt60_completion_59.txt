  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` is a function that schedules a function to be executed after a specified number of milliseconds, while `setImmediate` is a function that schedules a function to be executed asynchronously as soon as possible.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestAnimationFrame.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestAnimationFrame` is a function that schedules a function to be executed before the next repaint of the screen, while `setImmediate` is a function that schedules a function to be executed asynchronously as soon as possible.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout.bind(null, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout(fn, 0)` is a function that schedules a function to be executed asynchronously as soon as possible, while `setImmediate` is a function that schedules a function to be
