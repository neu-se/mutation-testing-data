```
linkurl.subdomain.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the `subdomain` property of the `linkurl` object, which may be different from the length of the `subdomain` property of the `pageurl` object in the `gettype` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.path.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the `path` property of the `linkurl` object, which may be different from the length of the `path` property of the `pageurl` object in the `gettype` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.path.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the `path` property of the `pageurl` object, which may be different from the length of the `path` property of the `linkurl` object in the `gettype`
