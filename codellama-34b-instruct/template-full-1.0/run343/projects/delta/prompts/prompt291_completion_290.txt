  Here are three possible answers, each with a code fragment that replaces the PLACEHOLDER and a brief explanation of why it would result in different behavior:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
      const line = new Delta(this.ops.slice());
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new `Delta` object instead of pushing an operation to the existing `delta` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
      line.retain(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it retains one character instead of the entire line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
      if (iter.peekLength()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the length of the peeked operation is greater than zero instead of checking if it exists.

DONE.
