  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
then
```
This would result in different behavior because the `any` method is used to return the first resolved promise in an array, while the `then` method is used to handle the fulfilled promise and return a new promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
catch
```
This would result in different behavior because the `any` method is used to return the first resolved promise in an array, while the `catch` method is used to handle rejected promises and return a new promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
race
```
This would result in different behavior because the `any` method is used to return the first resolved promise in an array, while the `race` method is used to return the first promise that settles, regardless of whether it is fulfilled or rejected.

DONE.
