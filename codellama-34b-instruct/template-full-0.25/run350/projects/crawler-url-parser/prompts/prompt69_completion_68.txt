  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"http://example.com"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `sourceUrl` variable, which is not defined in the provided code snippet. By replacing it with a hardcoded URL, the `parse` function will be called with a different argument, which could potentially cause different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sourceUrl.replace("http://", "https://")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `sourceUrl` variable as-is, while the replaced code uses the `replace` method to modify the URL. This could potentially cause different behavior if the `sourceUrl` variable contains a different URL than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sourceUrl.split("/")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `sourceUrl` variable as-is, while the replaced code uses the `split` method to extract the first part of the URL. This
