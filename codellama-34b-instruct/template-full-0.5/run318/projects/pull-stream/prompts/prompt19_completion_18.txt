  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref[1]` refers to the second element of the `ref` array, whereas `ref[0]` refers to the first element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref[length - 1]` refers to the last element of the `ref` array, whereas `ref[0]` refers to the first element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[length / 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref[length / 2]` refers to the middle element of the `ref` array, whereas `ref[0]` refers to the first element.

DONE.
