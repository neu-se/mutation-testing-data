  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setImmediate
```
This would result in different behavior because `setImmediate` executes the function immediately, whereas `setTimeout` schedules it for later execution with a specified delay.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would schedule `flush` to be called after a delay of 1 millisecond instead of immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(() => { throw new Error() }, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause `flush` to throw an error asynchronously after a delay of 0 milliseconds, which would be caught by the `runSingle` function and re-thrown synchronously.

DONE.
