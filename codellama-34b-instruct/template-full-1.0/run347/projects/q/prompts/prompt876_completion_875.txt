  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a method that returns the elements of an array within a specified range, while `array_slice.reverse()` would return the elements of an array in reverse order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.push(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a method that returns the elements of an array within a specified range, while `array_slice.push(1)` would add the element `1` to the end of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.splice(1, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a method that returns the elements of an array within a specified range, while `array_slice.splice(1, 1)` would remove the element at index `1` and return it.

DONE.
