  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that is not a function, so it would cause an error when the `progressed` callback is invoked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that is not a function, so it would cause an error when the `progressed` callback is invoked.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty function would be invoked when the `progressed` callback is called, and it would not have the same effect as the original code fragment.

DONE.
