  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `prop` variable is being incremented by 1, which may cause the `mapper` function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `prop` variable is being multiplied by 2, which may cause the `mapper` function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `prop` variable is being decremented by 1, which may cause the `mapper` function to behave differently.

DONE.
