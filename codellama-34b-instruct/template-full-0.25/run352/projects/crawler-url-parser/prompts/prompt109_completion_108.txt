  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url, currentUrl.baseurl
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseurl` property is not included in the original code fragment, which would cause the `urlMap` to be populated with different keys and potentially different values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url, currentUrl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because the `protocol` property is not included in the original code fragment, which would cause the `urlMap` to be populated with different keys and potentially different values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url, currentUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because the `host` property is not included in the original code fragment, which would cause the `urlMap` to be populated with different keys and potentially different values.

DONE.
