  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the policy is defined, but replacing it with `null` would always return `null`, even if the policy is defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the policy is defined, but replacing it with `undefined` would always return `undefined`, even if the policy is defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the policy is defined, but replacing it with `policy.name` would always return the name of the policy, even if the policy is not defined.

DONE.
