 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new URL(linkurl)
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to create a URL object from a string, which might not behave as expected if the input string is not a valid URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
linkurl.parse()
