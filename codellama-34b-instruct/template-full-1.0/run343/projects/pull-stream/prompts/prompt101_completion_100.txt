  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err !== true ? null : err, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `err` is equal to `true`, while the mutated code fragment checks whether `err` is not equal to `true`. If `err` is not equal to `true`, the callback will be called with `null` instead of `err`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err !== null ? err : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `err` is equal to `null`, while the mutated code fragment checks whether `err` is not equal to `null`. If `err` is not equal to `null`, the callback will be called with `err` instead of `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err && err.message === 'test' ? err : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `err` is truthy, while the mut
