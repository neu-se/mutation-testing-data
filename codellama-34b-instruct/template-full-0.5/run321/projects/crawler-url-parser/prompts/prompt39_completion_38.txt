  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.protocol && parsedUrl.protocol != 'https:'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the protocol is not 'http:' or 'https:', while this replacement only checks if it is not 'https:'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.protocol && parsedUrl.protocol != 'http:'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the protocol is not 'http:' or 'https:', while this replacement only checks if it is not 'http:'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.protocol && parsedUrl.protocol != 'http:' && parsedUrl.protocol != 'https:'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the protocol is not 'http:' or 'https:', while this replacement only checks if it is not 'http:' and 'https:'.

DONE.
