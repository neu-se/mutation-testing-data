  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['asinh']
```
This would result in different behavior because `asinh` takes the arc sine of a complex number, whereas `asin` takes the arc sine of a real number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['acos']
```
This would result in different behavior because `acos` takes the arc cosine of a complex number, whereas `asin` takes the arc sine of a real number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['atan']
```
This would result in different behavior because `atan` takes the arc tangent of a complex number, whereas `asin` takes the arc sine of a real number.

DONE.
