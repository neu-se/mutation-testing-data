  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(progress)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when` is a function that takes a promise or a value and returns a promise for the resolution of that value. In this case, `progress` is a function that takes a promise and returns a promise for the resolution of that promise, but with the `Q.when` function, the `progress` function is called immediately and the resulting promise is passed to `Q.when`, which then returns a promise for the resolution of that promise. This would result in different behavior because the `progress` function is called immediately, whereas in the original code, it is called only when the promise is resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.delay(progress, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.delay` is a function that takes a promise or a value and returns a promise for the resolution of that value after a certain number of milliseconds. In this case, `progress` is a function that takes a promise and returns a promise
