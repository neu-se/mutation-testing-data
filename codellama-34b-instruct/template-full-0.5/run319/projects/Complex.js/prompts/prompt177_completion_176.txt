  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c * d
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only multiplies `c` by `d` if `c` is greater than `d`, but this new code fragment would multiply `c` by `d` regardless of their relative values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c / d
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only divides `c` by `d` if `c` is greater than `d`, but this new code fragment would divide `c` by `d` regardless of their relative values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c - d
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only subtracts `d` from `c` if `c` is greater than `d`, but this new code fragment would subtract `d` from `c` regardless of their relative values.

DONE.
