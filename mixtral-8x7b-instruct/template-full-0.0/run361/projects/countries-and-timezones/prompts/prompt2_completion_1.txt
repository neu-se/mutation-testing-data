 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data['timezonesMap'] || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly accesses a potential undefined `timezonesMap` property from the data object, instead of using the `getTimezonesMap` function to ensure proper initialization and caching.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezonesMap(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it always creates a new timezones map instead of reusing the cached version from `timezonesMap`. This could lead to inconsistencies and incorrect data if the `buildTimezonesMap` function has side effects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns an empty object, ignoring the input data. This would cause the `buildCountry` function to always return an object with empty `timezones` and `allTimezones` arrays, regardless of the input.

DONE.
