  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [otherName, nodeArgs]).fail
```
This would result in different behavior because it would dispatch a different method name, potentially changing the function's behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, otherNodeArgs]).fail
```
This would result in different behavior because it would dispatch the same method name but with different arguments, potentially changing the function's behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).success
```
This would result in different behavior because it would dispatch the same method name and arguments, but using the "success" instead of "fail" method, potentially changing the function's behavior.

DONE.
