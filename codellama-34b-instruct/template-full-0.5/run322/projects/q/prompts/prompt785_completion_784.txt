  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (err) {
    throw err;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only rejects the promise with the error, while this new code fragment throws an exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (err) {
    return err;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only rejects the promise with the error, while this new code fragment returns the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (err) {
    return Q.reject(err);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only rejects the promise with the error, while this new code fragment uses the Q library to explicitly reject the promise with the error.

DONE.
