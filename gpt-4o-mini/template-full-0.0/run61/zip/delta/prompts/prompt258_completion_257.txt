Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the reference from the `insert` property to the `retain` property, which could lead to incorrect handling of operations that are supposed to insert text instead of retaining it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it switches the context from `thisOp` to `otherOp`, potentially causing the comparison to fail if the `insert` values are different, leading to incorrect delta operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the actual value with `null`, which would cause the equality check to always fail, leading to unexpected behavior in the delta processing logic.

DONE.
