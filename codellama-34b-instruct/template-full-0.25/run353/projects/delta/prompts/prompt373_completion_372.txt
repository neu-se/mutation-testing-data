  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip over the next two elements in the iteration, potentially causing the code to miss important operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would move the iteration backward by one element, potentially causing the code to repeat operations or skip over important elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(thisIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would move the iteration forward by the length of the current element, potentially causing the code to skip over important operations or repeat operations.

DONE.
