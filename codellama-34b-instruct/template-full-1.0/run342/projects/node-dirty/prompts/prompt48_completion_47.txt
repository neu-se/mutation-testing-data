  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, undefined, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code updates the value at the given key with the result of the `updater` function, while this modified code would assign `undefined` to the value at the given key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
anotherKey, updater(this.get(key)), cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the same key as the one provided in the `set` method, while this modified code uses a different key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, updater(this.get(key)), undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code provides a callback function as the third argument, while this modified code provides `undefined` instead.

DONE.
