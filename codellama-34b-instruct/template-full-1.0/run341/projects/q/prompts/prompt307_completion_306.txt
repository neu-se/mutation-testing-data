  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(answerPs[i + 1])
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise `answerPs[i + 1]` would be resolved instead of `answerPs[i]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(answerPs[i - 1])
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise `answerPs[i - 1]` would be resolved instead of `answerPs[i]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise(function (resolve, reject) {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would never be resolved or rejected.

DONE.
