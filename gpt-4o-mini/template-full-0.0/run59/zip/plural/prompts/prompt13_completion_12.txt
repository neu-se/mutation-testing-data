Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.slice(0, w.length - 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` does not modify the original string and can return an empty string if the length is less than 2, whereas `substr` would return the substring starting from the beginning of the string up to the specified length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substring(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring` starts from index 2 and returns the rest of the string, which would not correctly handle the pluralization rules that require removing the last two characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.charAt(w.length - 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `charAt` returns a single character instead of a substring, which would not fulfill the requirement of modifying the string to create a plural form.

DONE.
