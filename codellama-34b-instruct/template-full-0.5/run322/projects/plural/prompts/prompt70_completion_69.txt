  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('cello', 'celloes')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the plural -s to the word, while this new fragment adds the plural -es.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('cello', 'celli')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the plural -s to the word, while this new fragment adds the plural -i.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('cello', 'cell')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the plural -s to the word, while this new fragment removes the plural -s.

DONE.
