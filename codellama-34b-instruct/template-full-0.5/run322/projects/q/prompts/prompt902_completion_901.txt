  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is called on the promise returned by `fapply`, but `deferred.reject` is not passed as an argument to `fail`, so the promise will not be rejected if `fapply` fails.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject).then(deferred.resolve);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is called on the promise returned by `fapply`, but `deferred.resolve` is passed as an argument to `then`, so the promise will be resolved even if `fapply` fails.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail`
