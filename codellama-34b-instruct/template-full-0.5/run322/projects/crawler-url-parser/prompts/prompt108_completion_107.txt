  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the URL of the current URL object, rather than the URL object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the `currentUrl` key in the `urlMap` to `null`, rather than the URL object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the `currentUrl` key in the `urlMap` to an empty object, rather than the URL object.

DONE.
