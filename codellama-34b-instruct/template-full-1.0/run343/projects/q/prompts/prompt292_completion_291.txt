  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `notify` method with a `null` argument, which would cause the `race` function to reject the promise with a `TypeError` exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `notify` method with an `undefined` argument, which would cause the `race` function to ignore the notification and continue processing the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `notify` method with a numeric argument (1), which would cause the `race` function to resolve the promise with the value 1.

DONE.
