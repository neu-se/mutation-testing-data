  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.includes('http')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the string starts with "http" or "https", while this replacement only checks if the string includes "http".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.startsWith('https')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the string starts with "http" or "https", while this replacement only checks if the string starts with "https".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.endsWith('http')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the string starts with "http" or "https", while this replacement only checks if the string ends with "http".

DONE.
