  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for `!resolvedPromise` which is equivalent to `resolvedPromise === false`, but in the mutated code, we are checking for `resolvedPromise === undefined` which is different from `resolvedPromise === false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!resolvedPromise || resolvedPromise === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for `!resolvedPromise` which is equivalent to `resolvedPromise === false`, but in the mutated code, we are checking for `!resolvedPromise || resolvedPromise === null` which is different from `resolvedPromise === false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise && resolvedPromise !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for `!resolvedPromise` which is equivalent to `resolved
