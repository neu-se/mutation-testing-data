  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `requestTick` function immediately, rather than passing it as a callback to be called later.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would bind the `requestTick` function to the `null` context, rather than the `this` context that it was originally called with.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would bind the `requestTick` function to the `this` context, rather than the `null` context that it was originally called with.

DONE.
