  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, this
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `calculateBearing` method to be called on the `GeoPoint` instance itself, rather than on the `point` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point, point
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `calculateBearing` method to be called on the `point` argument twice, rather than once.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `calculateBearing` method to be called on the `GeoPoint` instance with a `null` argument, which would likely result in an error.

DONE.
