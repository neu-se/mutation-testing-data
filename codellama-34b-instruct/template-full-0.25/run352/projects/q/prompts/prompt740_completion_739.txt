  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer(null)` would create a new deferred object with a null promise, whereas `Q.defer` would create a new deferred object with a promise that is not yet resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer(undefined)` would create a new deferred object with an undefined promise, whereas `Q.defer` would create a new deferred object with a promise that is not yet resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer(Promise.resolve())
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer(Promise.resolve())` would create a new deferred object with a promise that is already resolved, whereas `Q.defer` would create a new deferred object with a promise that is not yet resolved.
