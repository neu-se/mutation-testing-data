  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.error.on
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.error` is not the same as `output.on`, and it would cause the error event to be emitted even if the output stream is not in an error state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.emit('error')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the output stream to emit an error event, regardless of whether the stream is in an error state or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.pipe(process.stdout)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pipe the output stream to the `process.stdout` stream, rather than the `zipArchive` stream.

DONE.
