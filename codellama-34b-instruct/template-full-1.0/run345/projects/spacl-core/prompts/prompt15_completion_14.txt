  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split
```
This would result in different behavior because `spec.split` returns an array of substrings, whereas `spec.match` returns a `RegExpMatchArray` object representing the matches found in `spec`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `spec[1]` represents the second character in `spec`, whereas `spec.match` searches for matches in the entire string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^$/
```
This would result in different behavior because `/^$/` is a regular expression that matches the start and end of a string, but it does not match any characters in between. Therefore, any non-empty string would not match this regular expression, whereas `spec.match` would match any non-empty string.

DONE.
