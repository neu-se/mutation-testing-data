  DONE.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.cos` function returns the cosine of the argument, which is not the same as the `Math.sin` function that was originally used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.sin` function returns the sine of the argument, which is not the same as the `Math.cos` function that was originally used.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.tan` function returns the tangent of the argument, which is not the same as the `Math.cos` function that was originally used.
