  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would always be false, causing the `delete` operation to be skipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would always be true, causing the `delete` operation to be executed even if the length is 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would always be false, causing the `delete` operation to be skipped.

DONE.
