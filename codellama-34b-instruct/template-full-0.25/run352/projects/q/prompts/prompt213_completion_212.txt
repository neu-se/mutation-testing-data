  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` checks if the value is a promise-like object, while `value !== null` simply checks if the value is not null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value instanceof Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` checks if the value is a promise-like object, while `value instanceof Promise` checks if the value is an instance of the `Promise` class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof value === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` checks if the value is a promise-like object, while `typeof value === "object"` checks if the value is an object.

DONE.
