  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key + 1]
```
This change will cause the `get` method to return the value of the next property in the object, rather than the value of the specified property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key - 1]
```
This change will cause the `get` method to return the value of the previous property in the object, rather than the value of the specified property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key * 2]
```
This change will cause the `get` method to return the value of the property with the specified key, but with the value doubled.

DONE.
