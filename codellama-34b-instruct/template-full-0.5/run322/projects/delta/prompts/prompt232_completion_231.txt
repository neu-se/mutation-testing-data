  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, while adding 1 would result in a different length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, while subtracting 1 would result in a different length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next().length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method returns the next operation in the iterator, while the `length` property returns the length of the operation.

DONE.
