Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of fulfilling the promise with the provided value, it would reject the promise, leading to a different promise state and potentially triggering error handling in the calling code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Promise.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that resolves with the value, rather than returning the original value directly if it is not a promise, which could lead to unexpected behavior in promise chaining.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return null;
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `null` would not fulfill the promise with any value, which could lead to the promise being in a pending state indefinitely, causing issues for any consumers expecting a resolved value.

DONE.
