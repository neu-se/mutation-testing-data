Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of the original `args` would cause the method to be called without any arguments, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or errors in the called function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because passing an empty array instead of the original `args` would mean that the method is called with no arguments, which may not be the intended behavior if the method expects certain parameters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` instead of the original `args` would lead to the method being called with an undefined value, which could cause the function to fail or behave incorrectly if it relies on receiving an array of arguments.

DONE.
