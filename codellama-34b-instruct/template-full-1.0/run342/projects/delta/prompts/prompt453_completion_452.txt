  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.next() + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because `next()` would be called without the correct arguments, leading to an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.next(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because `next()` would be called with an invalid argument (0), leading to an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.next(Infinity);
```
This would result in different behavior because `next()` would be called with an argument that is not a valid number, leading to an error.

DONE.
