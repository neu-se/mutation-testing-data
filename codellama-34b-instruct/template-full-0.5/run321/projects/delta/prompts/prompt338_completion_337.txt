  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseIndex` variable is used to track the index of the current element in the `base` array, and incrementing it by one would cause the `slice` method to return a different subset of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseIndex` variable is used to track the index of the current element in the `base` array, and decrementing it by one would cause the `slice` method to return a different subset of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseIndex` variable is used to track the index of the current element in the `base` array, and incrementing it by two would cause the `slice` method to return a different subset of the array.

DONE.
