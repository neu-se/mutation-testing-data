  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `laterQueue.push()` method would not be called with the expected `task` argument, leading to a different execution path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `laterQueue.push()` method would not be called with the expected `task` argument, leading to a different execution path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `laterQueue.push()` method would not be called with the expected `task` argument, leading to a different execution path.

DONE.
