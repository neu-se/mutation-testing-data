  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"http://example.com"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` function would return a different object, with the `protocol` property set to "http:", instead of the original `baseUrlStr` which could be any string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"https://example.com"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` function would return a different object, with the `protocol` property set to "https:", instead of the original `baseUrlStr` which could be any string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"ftp://example.com"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` function would return a different object, with the `protocol` property set to "ftp:", instead of the original `baseUrlStr` which could be any string.

DONE.
