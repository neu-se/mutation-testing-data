  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.warn("")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `console` object and its `warn` method exist before attempting to use them, while this replacement code always attempts to use `console.warn` regardless of whether it exists or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof console.warn === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `console.warn` is a function, while this replacement code checks if it is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof console !== "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `console` is an object, while this replacement code checks if it is not an object.

DONE.
