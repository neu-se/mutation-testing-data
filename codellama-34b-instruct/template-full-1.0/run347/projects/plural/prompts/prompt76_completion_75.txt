  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'dices'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `'dice'`, which is the correct plural form of the word "die". Replacing it with `'dices'` would produce the incorrect plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'eye'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `'die'`, which is a different word than `'eye'`. Replacing it with `'eye'` would produce a completely different plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'dice'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `'dice'`, which is already the correct plural form of the word "die". Replacing it with `'dice'` would not produce any different behavior.

DONE.
