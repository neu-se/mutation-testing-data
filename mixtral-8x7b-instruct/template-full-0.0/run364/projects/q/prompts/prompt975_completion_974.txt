 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the Array global's slice method instead of the utility module's array\_slice function. This could lead to unexpected results when dealing with arguments objects or other non-array iterables.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
nodeArgs.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array by calling the slice method on nodeArgs without any arguments. This would not consider the optional 'start' and 'end' parameters that array\_slice accepts, potentially changing the behavior when dealing with a subset of the arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
nodeArgs.splice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the original nodeArgs array by removing elements from the start position. This would not only return a new array but also change the original nodeArgs array, which is not the intended behavior in the original code.
