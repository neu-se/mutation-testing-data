    deferred.reject(exception);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only had a rejection handler, but this new code fragment has both a rejection and a fulfillment handler.

```
this.then(function (value) {

This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only had a rejection handler, but this new code fragment has both a rejection and a fulfillment handler, and also
