  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `cos` is the cosine function, which returns the cosine of the argument, whereas `sin` returns the sine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `tan` is the tangent function, which returns the tangent of the argument, whereas `sin` returns the sine.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `acos` is the inverse cosine function, which returns the angle (in radians) whose cosine is the argument, whereas `sin` returns the sine.

DONE.
