  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the `read` variable, which would change the result of the `pull` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the `read` variable, which would change the result of the `pull` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reset the `read` variable to 0, which would change the result of the `pull` function.

DONE.
