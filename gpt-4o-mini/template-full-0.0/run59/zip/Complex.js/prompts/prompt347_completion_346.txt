Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the trigonometric function from sine to cosine, which will yield different values for the imaginary part of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(b + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the input to the sine function by adding 1 to `b`, which will produce a different output than the original `Math.sin(b)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(b * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it alters the input to the sine function by multiplying `b` by 2, which will also yield different results compared to the original `Math.sin(b)`.

DONE.
