  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with null.
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would pass the arguments array to the nodeArgs function, while the modified code would pass a null value instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with an empty array.
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would pass the arguments array to the nodeArgs function, while the modified code would pass an empty array instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with a new array.
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would pass the arguments array to the nodeArgs function, while the modified code would pass a new array containing the same elements as the arguments array instead.

DONE.
