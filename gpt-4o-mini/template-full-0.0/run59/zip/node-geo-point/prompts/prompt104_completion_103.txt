Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil` rounds a number up to the nearest integer, while `Math.floor` rounds down, potentially resulting in different tile coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.round` rounds a number to the nearest integer, which can lead to different tile coordinates compared to the consistent downward rounding of `Math.floor`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude / 360 * Math.pow(2, zoom)
```
This would result in different behavior because it omits the addition of 180, which is necessary for correctly calculating the x-coordinate of the tile, leading to incorrect tile positioning.

DONE.
