 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.keys(this.verbs)
```
This would result in different behavior because it iterates over the keys of the `verbs` object, rather than the provided `verbs` array-like argument. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the order of iteration is not as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.verbs.filter(verb => verbs.includes(verb))
```
This would result in different behavior because it filters the `verbs` object to only include the verbs provided as arguments, rather than simply setting their values to `false`. This could lead to unexpected behavior if multiple verbs are provided, as only the ones present in the `verbs` object would be marked as denied.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.verbs.map(verb => false)
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the value of all verbs in the `ver
