  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Request timed out')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new `Error` object with a different message, which would be caught by the `reject` function and handled differently than a `TimeoutError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new TimeoutError('Request timed out')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new `TimeoutError` object with a different message, which would be caught by the `reject` function and handled differently than a `TimeoutError` with the default message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Request timed out')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new `Error` object with a different message, which would be caught by the `reject` function and handled differently than a `TimeoutError`.

DONE.
