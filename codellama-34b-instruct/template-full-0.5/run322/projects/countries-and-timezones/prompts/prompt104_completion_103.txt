  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [key]: tzs[key] + 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return the timezone object as-is, while this replacement would return a modified timezone object with an increased value for the `key` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [key]: tzs[key] - 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return the timezone object as-is, while this replacement would return a modified timezone object with a decreased value for the `key` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [key]: tzs[key] * 2 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return the timezone object as-is, while this replacement would return a modified timezone object with a doubled value for the `key` property.

DONE.
