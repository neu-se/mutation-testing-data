 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the mutated code would add 1 to the data before returning it, while the original code returns the data as is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the mutated code would return null instead of the data, potentially causing tests that expect data to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.data
```
This would result in different behavior because the mutated code would refer to the `data` property of the current object, while the original code simply returns the `data` argument passed to the function. If the object doesn't have a `data` property or if `data` is not defined, this would cause an error.

DONE.
