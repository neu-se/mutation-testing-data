  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that creates a rejected promise, whereas `errback` is a variable that references a function to be called with an error as its argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function and would cause an error if called as one. In the original code, `errback` is a function that is called with the error from the promise rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the function expression `() => {}` returns a function that takes no arguments, whereas `errback` is a variable that references a function that takes an error as its argument.

DONE.
