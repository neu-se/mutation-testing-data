  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set"
```
This would result in different behavior because `set` is a different method than `get`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete"
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a different method than `get`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"invoke"
```
This would result in different behavior because `invoke` is a different method than `get`.

DONE.
