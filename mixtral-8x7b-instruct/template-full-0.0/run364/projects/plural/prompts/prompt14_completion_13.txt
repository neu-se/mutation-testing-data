 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because it will cause `substr` to return an empty string, instead of the expected substring.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
w.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it will cause `substr` to return the last character of the word, instead of the expected substring.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it will cause a `TypeError` to be thrown, as `substr` expects a number as its first argument.

DONE.
