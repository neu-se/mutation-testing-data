  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```math.cos(b)```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function has a different domain than the `sin` function, and would not produce the same range of values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```math.tan(b)```
This would result in different behavior because the `tan` function has a different domain than the `sin` function, and would not produce the same range of values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```math.asin(b)```
This would result in different behavior because the `asin` function has a different domain than the `sin` function, and would not produce the same range of values.

DONE.
