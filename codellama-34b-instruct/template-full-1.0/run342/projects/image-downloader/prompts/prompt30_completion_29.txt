  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.startsWith('http') ? https : http
```
This would result in different behavior because the `startsWith` method is case-sensitive, while the `trimLeft` method is not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!url.endsWith('.html') ? https : http
```
This would result in different behavior because the `endsWith` method is case-sensitive, while the `trimLeft` method is not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.split('/')[0] === 'https' ? https : http
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method returns an array of substrings, while the `trimLeft` method returns a string with whitespace removed from the left side.

DONE.
