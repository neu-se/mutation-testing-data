  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const policy = this.get(name)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `const` keyword to declare a constant variable, while the new code fragment is using the `let` keyword to declare a variable that can be reassigned. This could potentially cause different behavior in the code, depending on how the variable is used later on.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const policy = this.get(name) || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `const` keyword to declare a constant variable, while the new code fragment is using the `let` keyword to declare a variable that can be reassigned. Additionally, the new code fragment is using the `||` operator to provide a default value for the `policy` variable if it is not found in the map. This could potentially cause different behavior in the code, depending on how the variable is used later on.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
