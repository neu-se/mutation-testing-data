  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, generate())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `cb` function if `end` is truthy, while this modified code fragment calls `cb` unconditionally.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, generate() + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the result of `generate()` directly to `cb`, while this modified code fragment passes the result of `generate() + 1` to `cb`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, generate() * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the result of `generate()` directly to `cb`, while this modified code fragment passes the result of `generate() * 2` to `cb`.

DONE.
