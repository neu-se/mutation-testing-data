  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` function is not returning the correct state of the promise. The `inspect` function is returning "unknown" instead of "fulfilled" or "rejected", which would cause the promise to be treated as pending, even if it has already been resolved or rejected.
