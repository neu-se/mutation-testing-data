  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.ops.length` is the total number of operations in the `other` iterator, whereas `otherIter.peekLength` is the length of the current operation being peeked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next().length
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next()` returns the next operation in the iterator, whereas `otherIter.peekLength` returns the length of the current operation being peeked.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek().length
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peek()` returns the current operation being peeked, whereas `otherIter.peekLength` returns the length of the current operation being peeked.

DONE.
