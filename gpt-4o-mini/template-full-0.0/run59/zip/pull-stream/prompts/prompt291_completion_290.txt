Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `unique` function to never pass any items through, effectively filtering out all duplicates instead of allowing the second occurrence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` may lead to unexpected results in the `unique` function, potentially causing it to treat all items as unique or throw an error, depending on its implementation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because using a numeric constant instead of a boolean may lead to incorrect evaluations in the `unique` function, which is likely expecting a boolean value to determine whether to pass through the item.

DONE.
