  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substring(0, w.length - 2) + 'ices'
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.substring(0, w.length - 2)` would return the substring of `w` from index `0` up to (but not including) index `w.length - 2`, resulting in a string that is one character shorter than the original. By appending `'ices'`, we would be adding an extra 's' to the end of the string, resulting in a plural form that is different from the original.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substring(0, w.length - 2) + 'iles'
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.substring(0, w.length - 2)` would return the substring of `w` from index `0` up to (but not including) index `w.length - 2`, resulting in a string that is one character shorter than the original. By appending `'iles'`, we would
