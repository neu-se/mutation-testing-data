  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would no longer return a value, which could cause errors in the code that uses it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a null value, which could cause errors in the code that uses it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return an undefined value, which could cause errors in the code that uses it.

DONE.
