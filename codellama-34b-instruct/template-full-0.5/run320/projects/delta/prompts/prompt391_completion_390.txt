  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to skip over the next two elements in the array, potentially missing a necessary operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(thisIter.peekLength() - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to only iterate over the last element in the array, potentially missing other necessary operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(thisIter.peekLength() + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to iterate over the last element in the array and then attempt to access an element that is out of bounds, potentially causing an error.

DONE.
