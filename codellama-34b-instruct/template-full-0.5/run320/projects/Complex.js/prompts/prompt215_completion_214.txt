  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a positive value, whereas the original code fragment would return a negative value if `b` was negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a positive value, whereas the original code fragment would return a negative value if `b` was positive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a positive value, whereas the original code fragment would return a negative value if `b` was negative.

DONE.
