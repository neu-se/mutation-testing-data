  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNotGlob
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNotGlob` is a fictional function that does not exist in the code snippet, so it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
glob.isGlob
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the behavior of the code that checks if the input is a glob, potentially causing the code to think that it is a glob even if it is not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
glob.isNotGlob
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the behavior of the code that checks if the input is a glob, potentially causing the code to think that it is not a glob even if it is.

DONE.
