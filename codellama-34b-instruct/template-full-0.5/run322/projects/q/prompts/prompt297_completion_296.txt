  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `x`, regardless of the value of `y`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!y
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `!y`, which is the negation of `y`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of `y` plus 1.

DONE.
