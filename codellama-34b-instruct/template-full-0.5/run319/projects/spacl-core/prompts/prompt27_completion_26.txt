  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flatten(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flatten` function would not be called with the `final` argument set to `true`, which would cause the regular expression to be generated differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flatten(true, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flatten` function would be called with two arguments instead of one, which would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flatten(false, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flatten` function would be called with the `final` argument set to `false` and the `any` argument set to `true`, which would cause the regular expression to be generated differently.

DONE.
