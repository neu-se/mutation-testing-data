  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Q.resolve()```
This would result in different behavior because ```Q.resolve()``` is a function that returns a promise that is resolved with an empty value, whereas ```value``` is a parameter that could contain any value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Q.reject()```
This would result in different behavior because ```Q.reject()``` is a function that returns a promise that is rejected with an empty value, whereas ```value``` is a parameter that could contain any value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Q.defer()```
This would result in different behavior because ```Q.defer()``` is a function that returns a new deferred object, whereas ```value``` is a parameter that could contain any value.

DONE.
