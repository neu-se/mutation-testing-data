  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.split("")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the link url by slashes, but this new code fragment would split it by any character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"!"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the link url by slashes, but this new code fragment would split it by exclamation marks.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.replace(/^\//, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the link url by slashes, but this new code fragment would remove any leading slashes before splitting it by slashes.

DONE.
