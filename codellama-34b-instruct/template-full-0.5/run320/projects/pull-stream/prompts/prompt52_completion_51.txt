  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `read` would return the value of the `read` variable, while the new code fragment `read + 1` would return the value of the `read` variable plus 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `read` would return the value of the `read` variable, while the new code fragment `read - 1` would return the value of the `read` variable minus 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `read` would return the value of the `read` variable, while the new code fragment `read * 2` would return the value of the `read` variable multiplied by 2.

DONE.
