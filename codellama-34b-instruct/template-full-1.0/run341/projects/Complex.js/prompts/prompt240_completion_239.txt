  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return `0` for any input value, as `a * b` is always equal to `0` when `a` and `b` are both `0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return a value of `0` for any input value, as `a + b` is always equal to `0` when `a` and `b` are both `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return a value of `0` for any input value, as `a - b` is always equal to `0` when `a` and `b` are both `0`.

DONE.
