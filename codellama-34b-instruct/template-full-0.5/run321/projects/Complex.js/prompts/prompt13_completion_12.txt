  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x > b || -b > x
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of operations is different. In the original code, the negation is applied to `b` before the comparison with `x`, whereas in the replaced code, the negation is applied to `x` before the comparison with `b`. This could potentially cause the comparison to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x > -b || b > x
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation is applied to `b` before the comparison with `x`, whereas in the original code, the negation is applied to `x` before the comparison with `b`. This could potentially cause the comparison to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x > b && -b > x
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation is applied to `b` before the comparison with `x`, whereas in the original code, the negation
