 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/[aeiou]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression now checks for a lowercase 'e' or 'u' before the 'o', instead of checking for any vowel.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/[aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w.toUpperCase() + 'S' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function now converts the entire word to uppercase and appends 'S', instead of just appending 's'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/[aeiouy]o$/i, function(w, i, a) { return w + a[i-1] }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function now appends the previous character in the word instead of always app
