 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'x'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the object has a property named 'x' instead of 'longitude'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would generate a random number instead of checking if the object has the 'longitude' property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
input => input.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the object has a method named 'longitude' that returns the longitude value, instead of directly checking if the 'longitude' property exists.

DONE.
