  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude + point.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using the latitude and longitude of the current point and the input point to calculate the bearing, while this code fragment is adding the latitude of the current point to the longitude of the input point, which would result in a different bearing value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.latitude - this.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using the latitude and longitude of the current point and the input point to calculate the bearing, while this code fragment is subtracting the longitude of the current point from the latitude of the input point, which would result in a different bearing value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude * point.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using the latitude and longitude of the current point and the input point to calculate the bearing, while this code fragment is multiplying the latitude
