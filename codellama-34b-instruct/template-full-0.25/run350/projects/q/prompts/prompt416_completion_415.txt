  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `object` to be a promise, but `null` is not a promise and will not have an `inspect()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `object` to be a promise, but `undefined` is not a promise and will not have an `inspect()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `object` to be a promise, but `{}` is not a promise and will not have an `inspect()` method.

DONE.
