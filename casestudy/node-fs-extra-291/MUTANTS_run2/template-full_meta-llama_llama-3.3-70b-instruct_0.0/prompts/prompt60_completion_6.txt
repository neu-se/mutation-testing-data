Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'$'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only escape the first '$' character instead of all of them, potentially leading to incorrect path replacements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'$$1'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce a capture group in the replacement string, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the replacement is used in a regular expression context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
targetPath
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not escape the '$' character at all, potentially leading to incorrect path replacements if the target path contains '$' characters.

DONE.
