  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
regex, 'ves'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `replace` method to replace the matched substring with `'ves'`, while the buggy code fragment uses the `replace` method to replace the entire string with `'ves'`.

DONE.
