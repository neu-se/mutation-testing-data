  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `aborted` variable is truthy, while the new code fragment checks if it is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `aborted` variable is truthy, while the new code fragment checks if it is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `aborted` variable is truthy, while the new code fragment checks if it is falsey.

DONE.
