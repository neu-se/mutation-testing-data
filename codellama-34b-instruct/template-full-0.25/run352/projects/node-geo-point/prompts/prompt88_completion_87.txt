  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the latitude of the first point instead of the longitude, which would lead to incorrect calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the sine of the latitude of the second point instead of the cosine, which would lead to incorrect calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(λ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the cosine of the longitude of the first point instead of the latitude, which would lead to incorrect calculations.

DONE.
