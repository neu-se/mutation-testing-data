  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method would return the entire string instead of the expected substring.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 2, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method would return an empty string instead of the expected substring.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length, w.length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method would return the entire string instead of the expected substring.

DONE.
