  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.doesNotMatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `doesNotMatch` is a different method than `matches`, and it would return the opposite result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.matches(path, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `matches` method with the `ctx` argument, which is not present in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.matches(path, ctx, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `matches` method with an additional `true` argument, which would cause it to return a different result.

DONE.
