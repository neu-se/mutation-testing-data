  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNegative']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNegative` is a different method from `isZero`, and it checks if the complex number is negative, whereas `isZero` checks if it is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because `!` is the logical NOT operator, and it negates the result of `isZero`, so if the number is zero, it will return `false`, and if it is not zero, it will return `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite` checks if the complex number is infinite, and it will return `true` if the number is infinite, and `false` otherwise.

DONE.
