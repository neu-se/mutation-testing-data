Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly call the success callback instead of the error callback when an exception occurs, potentially leading to unhandled promise rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("An error occurred"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always reject the promise with a new error message, regardless of the actual error that occurred in the generator, thus masking the original error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would effectively do nothing when an error occurs, leading to the promise being neither resolved nor rejected, which could cause the application to hang or behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
