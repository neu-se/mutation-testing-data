  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was not null, it was the result of the `read` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was not a boolean value, it was the result of the `read` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was not undefined, it was the result of the `read` function.

DONE.
