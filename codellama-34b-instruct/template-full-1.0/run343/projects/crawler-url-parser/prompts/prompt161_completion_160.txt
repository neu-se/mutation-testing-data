  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_without_last_part = pageurl_without_last_part;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the value of `pageurl_without_last_part` to `linkurl_without_last_part` every time the condition is evaluated, which makes the condition always false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_without_last_part != pageurl_without_last_part;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate to true only when the two strings are not equal, which would be the opposite of the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_without_last_part.localeCompare(pageurl_without_last_part) == 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the two strings using a case-insensitive comparison, which could result in different behavior if the strings contain uppercase or lowercase characters.
