  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[match, result]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a destructuring assignment that assigns the first element of the `match` array to the `match` variable and the second element to the `result` variable. The new code fragment is a regular expression that matches the `match` variable and captures the first group in the `result` variable. This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is used to extract the first element of the `match` array, while the new code fragment is used to match the `match` variable and capture the first group in the `result` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
