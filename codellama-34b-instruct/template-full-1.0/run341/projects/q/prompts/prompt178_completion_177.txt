  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(<PLACEHOLDER>
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNodeFrame` function would return `true` for any line in the stack trace that starts with `(`, rather than just lines that refer to the `module.js` file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
module)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNodeFrame` function would return `true` for any line in the stack trace that matches the regular expression `/module)/`, rather than just lines that refer to the `module.js` file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
require(module.js)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNodeFrame` function would return `true` for any line in the stack trace that refers to a `require` call that includes the `module.js` file, rather than just lines that refer to the `module.js` file itself.

DONE.
