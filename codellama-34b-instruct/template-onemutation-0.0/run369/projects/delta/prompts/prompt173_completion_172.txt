  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter.peekLength()` method to return a value that is one more than the actual length of the next operation in the `other` iterator, which would cause the `while` loop to iterate one more time than it should, potentially leading to an infinite loop or other unexpected behavior.
