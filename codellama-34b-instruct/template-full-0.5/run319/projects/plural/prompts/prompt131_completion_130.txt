  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].test(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, regardless of whether the regular expression matches the word or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type(rule[0]) === 'RegExp'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, regardless of whether the regular expression matches the word or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].test(word) && type(rule[0]) === 'RegExp'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, regardless of whether the regular expression matches the word or not.

DONE.
