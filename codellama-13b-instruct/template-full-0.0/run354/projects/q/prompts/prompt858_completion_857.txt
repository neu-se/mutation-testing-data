  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clearTimeout(timeoutId)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clearTimeout` function is called with the `timeoutId` variable, which is a reference to the timeout that was created in the `timeout` method. This would clear the timeout and prevent the promise from being rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clearTimeout(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clearTimeout` function is called with the `undefined` value, which is not a valid timeout reference. This would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clearTimeout(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clearTimeout` function is called with the `null` value, which is not a valid timeout reference. This would cause an error to be thrown.

DONE.
