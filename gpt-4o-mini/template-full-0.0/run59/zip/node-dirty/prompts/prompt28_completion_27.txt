Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event emitted would indicate an error instead of a successful drain, potentially leading to confusion in the handling of the database state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a 'load' event instead of a 'drain' event, which could mislead listeners into thinking that the loading process has completed when it has not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finish'
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'finish' event is typically associated with the completion of a writable stream, which does not accurately represent the state of the database after a write operation, potentially leading to incorrect assumptions about the data persistence.

DONE.
