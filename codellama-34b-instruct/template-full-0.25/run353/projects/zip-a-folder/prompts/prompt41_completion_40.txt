  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
';'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the separator between glob patterns from a comma to a semicolon, which could cause the glob patterns to be interpreted differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'|'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the separator between glob patterns from a comma to a pipe, which could cause the glob patterns to be interpreted differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the separator between glob patterns from a comma to a space, which could cause the glob patterns to be interpreted differently.

DONE.
