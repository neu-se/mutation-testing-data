  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1[1] > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attempt1[1]` is a string, and the comparison `attempt1[1] > 0` will always be false, even if `attempt1[1]` is a valid filename.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1[1] === "module.js"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attempt1[1]` is a string, and the comparison `attempt1[1] === "module.js"` will always be false, even if `attempt1[1]` is a valid filename.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1[1].indexOf("module.js") !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attempt1[1]` is a string, and the comparison `attempt1[1].indexOf("module.js") !== -1` will
