  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null || abort, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `_read` function to be called with `null` as the first argument, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err && abort, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `_read` function to be called with `err` as the first argument, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err || cb
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `_read` function to be called with `err` as the first argument, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
