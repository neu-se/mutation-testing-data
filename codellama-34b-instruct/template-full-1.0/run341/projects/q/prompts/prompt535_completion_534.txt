  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments in the callback is reversed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because both callbacks would be called with the same value, which is the fulfilled value of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because both callbacks would be called with `undefined` as their argument.

DONE.
