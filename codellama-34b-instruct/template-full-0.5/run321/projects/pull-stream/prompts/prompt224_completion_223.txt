  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the result of the `test` function, causing the `filter` function to return the opposite of what it should.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function would be called with a different argument, which could potentially cause it to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function would be called with two arguments instead of one, which could potentially cause it to return a different result.

DONE.
