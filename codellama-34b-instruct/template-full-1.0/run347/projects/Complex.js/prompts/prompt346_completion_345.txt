  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because negating the value of `a` would change the result of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because adding 1 to the value of `a` would change the result of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because multiplying the value of `a` by 2 would change the result of the function.

DONE.
