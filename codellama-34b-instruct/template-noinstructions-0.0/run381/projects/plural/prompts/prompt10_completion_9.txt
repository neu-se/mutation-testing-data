  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]y$|quy$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regular expression is removed, which would cause the regular expression to be case-sensitive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]y$|quy$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regular expression is added, which would cause the regular expression to be case-insensitive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]y$|quy$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regular expression is added, which would cause the regular expression to match all occurrences in the input string, rather than just the first one.

DONE.
