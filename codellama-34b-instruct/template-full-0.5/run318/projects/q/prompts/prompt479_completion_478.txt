  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `at` would be decremented by 1, which would result in the wrong index being removed from the `unhandledRejections` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `at` would be incremented by 1, which would result in the wrong index being removed from the `unhandledReasons` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at = at + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `at` would be incremented by 1, which would result in the wrong index being removed from the `unhandledRejections` array.

DONE.
