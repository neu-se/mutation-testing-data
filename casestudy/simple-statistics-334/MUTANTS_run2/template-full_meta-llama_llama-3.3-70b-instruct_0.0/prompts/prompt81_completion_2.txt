Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the rounding of the index from ceiling to floor, potentially selecting a different element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
indices[r]
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly uses the value at the `r` index without applying any rounding, potentially causing an out-of-bounds erroemr oent.

Optioorrect eln 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.max
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.max` is a function that returns the largest of zero or more numbers, but in this context, it would be used as if it were a rounding function like `Math.ceil`, which would cause a runtime error because `Math.max` expects multiple arguments, not a single value to round.

DONE.
