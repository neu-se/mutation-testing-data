  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp, args.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.slice()` creates a shallow copy of the `args` array, whereas `args` by itself would pass a reference to the original array. This could cause unexpected behavior if the function being called modifies the array.
