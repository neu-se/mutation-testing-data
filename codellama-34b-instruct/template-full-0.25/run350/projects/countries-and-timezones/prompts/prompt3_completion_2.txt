  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezonesMap` function expects a non-null object as its argument, and passing `null` would cause the function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezonesMap` function expects a non-undefined object as its argument, and passing `undefined` would cause the function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezonesMap` function expects a non-empty object as its argument, and passing an empty object would cause the function to return an empty object, which is not the expected behavior.

DONE.
