  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return args;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `all` method to return a promise that resolves to an array of arguments, rather than a promise that resolves to the value of the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return args[0];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `all` method to return a promise that resolves to the value of the first argument, rather than a promise that resolves to an array of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return args.length;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `all` method to return a promise that resolves to the length of the array of arguments, rather than a promise that resolves to the value of the first argument.

DONE.
