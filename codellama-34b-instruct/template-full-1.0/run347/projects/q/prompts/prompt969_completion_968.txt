  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).ncall
```
This would result in different behavior because `ncall` is a different method than `npost`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object)[name].npost
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `npost` method of the property with the name specified by the `name` parameter, rather than the `npost` method of the object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).nsend(name)
```
This would result in different behavior because `nsend` is a different method than `npost`.

DONE.
