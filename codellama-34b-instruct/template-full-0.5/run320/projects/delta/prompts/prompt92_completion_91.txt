  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `>` operator will always return `false` if `index` is equal to `this.ops.length`, whereas the `===` operator would return `true` in that case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<` operator will always return `true` if `index` is less than `this.ops.length`, whereas the `===` operator would return `false` in that case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index !== this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator will always return `true` if `index` is not equal to `this.ops.length`, whereas the `===` operator would return `false` in that case.

DONE.
