  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain !== lastOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp.retain` and `lastOp.retain` are different, so this comparison would always return `true`, regardless of whether the retention length is the same or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain <= lastOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because this comparison would always return `true` if `newOp.retain` is less than or equal to `lastOp.retain`, regardless of whether the retention length is the same or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain >= lastOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because this comparison would always return `true` if `newOp.retain` is greater than or equal to `lastOp.retain`, regardless of whether the retention length is the same or not.
