  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return test(data) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is missing, which would cause the function to return the opposite of what it's supposed to.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return test(data) && data.length > 0 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is added, which would cause the function to only return `true` if `data` is not empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return test(data) || data.length === 0 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is added, which would cause the function to return `true` if `data` is empty or if `test(data)` returns `true`.

DONE.
