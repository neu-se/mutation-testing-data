  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `gettype` function expects a `LinkUrl` object, but the replaced code will pass `null` which will throw a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("test")
```
This would result in different behavior because `gettype` function is not actually performed and `console.log("test")` will be printed instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an invalid function call will be made and it will throw a runtime error.

DONE.
