  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x, y
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, causing the calculation of the bearing to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + y
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of the two arguments would cause the calculation of the bearing to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * y
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication of the two arguments would cause the calculation of the bearing to be incorrect.

DONE.
