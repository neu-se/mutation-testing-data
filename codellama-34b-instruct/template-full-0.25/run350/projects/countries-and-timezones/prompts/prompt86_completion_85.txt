  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c.id, options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `id` property of the `c` object as the first argument to `getCountry`, instead of passing the `c` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c.name, options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `name` property of the `c` object as the first argument to `getCountry`, instead of passing the `c` object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c.timezones[0], options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the first element of the `c.timezones` array as the first argument to `getCountry`, instead of passing the `c` object itself.

DONE.
