  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.sink(read)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `sink` method on `s` with `read` as an argument, which is not the same as simply returning `s.sink`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.sink(read, read)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `sink` method on `s` with `read` as the first argument and `read` as the second argument, which is not the same as simply returning `s.sink`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.sink(read, s)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `sink` method on `s` with `read` as the first argument and `s` as the second argument, which is not the same as simply returning `s.sink`.

DONE.
