  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['asin'](-this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `asin` function with the argument `this['im']`, which is the imaginary part of the complex number. However, the new code fragment uses the `asin` function with the argument `-this['im']`, which is the negative of the imaginary part of the complex number. This would cause the `asin` function to return a different value, which would in turn cause the `acos` function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['acos'](-this['re'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `acos` function with the argument `this['re']`, which is the real part of the complex number. However, the new code fragment uses the `acos` function with the argument `-this['re']`, which is the negative of the real part of the complex number. This would cause the `
