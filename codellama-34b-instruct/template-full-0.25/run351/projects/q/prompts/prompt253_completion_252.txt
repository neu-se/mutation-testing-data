  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a promise and would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a promise and would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because `new Error()` is not a promise and would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to throw an error.

DONE.
