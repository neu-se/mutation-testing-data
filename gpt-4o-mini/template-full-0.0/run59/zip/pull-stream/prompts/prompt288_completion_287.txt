Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always pass `null` as the second argument to the callback, regardless of the data processed, potentially leading to unexpected results in the consuming code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end, data
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the value of `end`, which could cause the callback to be called with a boolean value instead of the expected `end` status, leading to incorrect handling of the data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, end
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the order of the arguments passed to the callback, which could break the expected contract of the callback function, leading to confusion or errors in the handling of the response.

DONE.
