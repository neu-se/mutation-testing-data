 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` does not modify the original array, but instead returns a new array. The original code modifies the `ops` array by using `splice`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.push
