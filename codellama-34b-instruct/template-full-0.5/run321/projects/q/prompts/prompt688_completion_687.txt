  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.call(null, "apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments)])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method is being called on `null` instead of `this`, which would cause the method to not have access to the `Promise` instance's internal state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.call(this, "apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments)])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method is being called with a different `this` value, which could cause the method to not have access to the `Promise` instance's internal state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.apply(null, ["apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments)]])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method is being called with a different set of arguments, which could
