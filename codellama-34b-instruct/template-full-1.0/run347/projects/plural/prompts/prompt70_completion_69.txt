  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('cello', 'cras')
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "cello" would be added to the rules with the result "cras", but it should be "cellos".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('cello', 'licious')
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "cello" would be added to the rules with the result "licious", but it should be "cellos".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('cello', 'cellose')
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "cello" would be added to the rules with the result "cellose", but it should be "cellos".

DONE.
