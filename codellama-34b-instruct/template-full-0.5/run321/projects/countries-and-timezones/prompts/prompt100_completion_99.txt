  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzs.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is an object, but `tzs.length` is a number, and the `deliverTimezones` function expects an object as its first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(tzs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys(tzs)` returns an array of strings, but the original code fragment is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzs.map(tz => tz.name)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is an object, but `tzs.map(tz => tz.name)` returns an array of strings.

DONE.
