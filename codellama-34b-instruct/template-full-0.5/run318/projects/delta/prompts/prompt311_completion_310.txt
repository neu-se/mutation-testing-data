  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i++
```
This would result in different behavior because `i++` increments the value of `i` by 1, whereas `i` on its own does not change the value of `i`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `i + 1` adds 1 to the value of `i`, whereas `i` on its own does not change the value of `i`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `i - 1` subtracts 1 from the value of `i`, whereas `i` on its own does not change the value of `i`.

DONE.
