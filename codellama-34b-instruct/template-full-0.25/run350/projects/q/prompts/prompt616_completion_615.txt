  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with the `this` context bound to the first argument, which is `this` in this case. This means that the new function will always be called with the same `this` context, regardless of how it's called. In the original code, `this` is used as the context for the `dispatch` method, so replacing it with `this.dispatch.bind(this)` would cause the method to be called with the wrong context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` calls a function with a specific `this` context and arguments. In this case, it would call the `dispatch` method with `this` as the context and no arguments. This would cause the method to be called with the wrong context and arguments, which could result in unexpected behavior.
