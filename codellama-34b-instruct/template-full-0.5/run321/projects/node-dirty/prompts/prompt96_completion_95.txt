  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `!('key' in row)` checks if the key "key" is in the row object, while `row.key === undefined` checks if the value of the key "key" is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!row.hasOwnProperty('key')
```
This would result in different behavior because `!('key' in row)` checks if the key "key" is in the row object, while `!row.hasOwnProperty('key')` checks if the key "key" is a direct property of the row object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key !== 'key'
```
This would result in different behavior because `!('key' in row)` checks if the key "key" is in the row object, while `row.key !== 'key'` checks if the value of the key "key" is not equal to the string "key
