  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` returns the first element of the array and removes it from the array, while `pop` returns the last element of the array and removes it from the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.unshift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns the new length of the array, while `pop` returns the last element of the array and removes it from the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.push()
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array, while `pop` returns the last element of the array and removes it from the array.

DONE.
