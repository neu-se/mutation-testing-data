  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `MessageChannel` would be created with a different port number, which could affect the timing of the message being sent.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `MessageChannel` would be created with a null port number, which could cause an error when trying to send the message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `MessageChannel` would be created with an undefined port number, which could cause an error when trying to send the message.

DONE.
