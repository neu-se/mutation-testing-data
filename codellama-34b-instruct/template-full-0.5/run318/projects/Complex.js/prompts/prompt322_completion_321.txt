  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cos` function to return the wrong value, leading to incorrect calculations in the `tan` and `cot` functions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cos` function to return the wrong value, leading to incorrect calculations in the `tan` and `cot` functions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cos` function to return the wrong value, leading to incorrect calculations in the `tan` and `cot` functions.

DONE.
