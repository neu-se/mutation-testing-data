  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log10
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the square root function, which is replaced with the logarithm function. The logarithm function has a different output than the square root function, which causes the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(x * x) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the square root function to calculate the square root of a number, while the new code fragment calculates the square of a number and then subtracts 1 from it. These two operations produce different results, which causes the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the square root function, which is replaced with the sine function. The sine function has a different output than the square root function, which causes the function to behave differently.

DONE.
