  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `true` always returns `true`, while the new code fragment `false` always returns `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `true` always returns a boolean value, while the new code fragment `null` returns a null value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `true` always returns a boolean value, while the new code fragment `undefined` returns an undefined value.

DONE.
