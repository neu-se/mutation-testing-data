  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned `null`, while `undefined` would return a value that is not equal to `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned `null`, while `1` would return a value that is not equal to `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"null"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned `null`, while `"null"` would return a string that is not equal to `null`.

DONE.
