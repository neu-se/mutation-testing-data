  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"/"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the last part of the path, while the new code fragment would remove the first part of the path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the forward slash as the path separator, while the new code fragment would use the backslash as the path separator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the forward slash as the path separator, while the new code fragment would use the backslash as the path separator, and the new code fragment would also escape the backslash character.

DONE.
