  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.invert
```
This would result in different behavior because `AttributeMap.invert` is a function that inverts the attributes of an `AttributeMap` object, whereas `AttributeMap.diff` is a function that returns the difference between two `AttributeMap` objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.compose
```
This would result in different behavior because `AttributeMap.compose` is a function that composes two `AttributeMap` objects, whereas `AttributeMap.diff` is a function that returns the difference between two `AttributeMap` objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.transform
```
This would result in different behavior because `AttributeMap.transform` is a function that transforms an `AttributeMap` object based on a given delta, whereas `AttributeMap.diff` is a function that returns the difference between two `AttributeMap` objects.

DONE.
