  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the promise is rejected, while this code fragment checks if the promise is pending.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the promise is rejected, while this code fragment checks if the promise is fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "settled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the promise is rejected, while this code fragment checks if the promise is settled (i.e., either fulfilled or rejected).

DONE.
