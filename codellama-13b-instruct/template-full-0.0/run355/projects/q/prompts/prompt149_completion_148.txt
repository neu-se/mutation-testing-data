  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.push
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method adds an element to the end of the array, while the `unshift` method adds an element to the beginning of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.splice(0, 0, p.stack)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method adds an element to the array at a specific index, while the `unshift` method adds an element to the beginning of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.concat(p.stack)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method returns a new array that contains the elements of the original array and the elements of the argument array, while the `unshift` method adds an element to the beginning of the array.

DONE.
