  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` is a method that removes and replaces elements in an array, whereas `slice` is a method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` is a method that concatenates two or more arrays, whereas `slice` is a method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` is a method that creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, whereas `slice` is a method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array.

DONE.
