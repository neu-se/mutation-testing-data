  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the `other` iterator by `length` steps, potentially skipping some operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the `other` iterator by `length * 2` steps, potentially skipping some operations and potentially including some operations twice.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the `other` iterator by `length - 1` steps, potentially skipping some operations and potentially including some operations twice.

DONE.
