  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `false`, which means that the directory should not be included in the archive. Replacing it with `true` would include the directory in the archive, which could cause unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `false`, which means that the directory should not be included in the archive. Replacing it with `1` would include the directory in the archive, which could cause unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `false`, which means that the directory should not be included in the archive. Replacing it with `'foo'` would include the directory in the archive, which could cause unexpected behavior.

DONE.
