  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b == 0
```
This would result in a different expression overall since the operators are differently defined. If b is 0, the expression evaluates to NaN, whereas if b is Inf, the expression evaluates to Inf.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b % 2 == 0
```
This would result in a different expression overall since the operators are differently defined. If b is even, the expression evaluates to 0, whereas if b is Inf, the expression evaluates to NaN. 

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a != b
```
This would result in a different expression overall since the operators are differently defined. If a equals b, the expression evaluates to 0, whereas if a equals Inf-b, the expression evaluates to Inf. DONE.
