  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
request.get(options.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make a GET request instead of a POST request, which could cause the test to fail if the API endpoint being tested only supports POST requests.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
request.post(options.url, {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would send an empty body with the POST request, which could cause the test to fail if the API endpoint being tested requires a non-empty body.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
request.post(options.url, { foo: 'bar' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would send a different body with the POST request, which could cause the test to fail if the API endpoint being tested requires a specific body.

DONE.
