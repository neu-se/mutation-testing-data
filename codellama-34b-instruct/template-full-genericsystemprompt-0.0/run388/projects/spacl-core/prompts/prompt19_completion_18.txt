  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.length > 0 && string.endsWith('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the string has a length greater than 1, while this code fragment checks if the string has a length greater than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.length > 1 && string.endsWith('\\')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the string ends with a forward slash, while this code fragment checks if the string ends with a backslash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.length > 1 && string.endsWith('/') && string.startsWith('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if the string ends with a forward slash, while this code fragment checks if the string both ends and starts with a forward slash.

DONE.
