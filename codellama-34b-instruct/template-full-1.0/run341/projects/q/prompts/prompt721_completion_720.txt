  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise instead of resolving the current one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.isPending()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate to true if the promise is still pending instead of resolving it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.try()()()()()()()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would try to resolve the promise multiple times, leading to errors and unexpected behavior.

DONE.
