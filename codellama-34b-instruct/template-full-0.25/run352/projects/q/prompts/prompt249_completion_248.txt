  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.lastIndexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastIndexOf` returns the index of the last occurrence of the specified value, whereas `indexOf` returns the index of the first occurrence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.substring(0, e.stack.indexOf("\n"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only include the first line of the stack trace, whereas the original code includes the entire stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.split("\n").length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the number of lines in the stack trace, whereas the original code returns the index of the first occurrence of a newline character.

DONE.
