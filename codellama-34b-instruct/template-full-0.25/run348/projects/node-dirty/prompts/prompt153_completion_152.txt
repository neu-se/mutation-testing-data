  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the write stream to end immediately, instead of waiting for the buffer to be flushed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the write stream to be destroyed, instead of waiting for the buffer to be flushed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the write stream to be corked, instead of waiting for the buffer to be flushed.

DONE.
