  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
createWriteStream(dest + 'apstest')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new file with the name "destapstest", instead of overwriting the existing file "dest".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
createWriteStream(dest, { flags: 'a' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append the downloaded data to the existing file "dest", instead of overwriting it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
createWriteStream(dest + 'test')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new file with the name "desttest", instead of overwriting the existing file "dest".

DONE.
