  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `this['re']`, which is the real part of the complex number, while the new code fragment uses `this['im']`, which is the imaginary part of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * places + this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only multiplies `this['re']` by `places`, while the new code fragment adds `this['im']` to the result of the multiplication.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * places - this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only multiplies `this['re']` by `places`, while the new code fragment subtracts `this['im']` from the result of the multiplication.

DONE.
