  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a function that returns a promise that is already resolved, whereas `reject` is a function that returns a promise that is rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("rejected")
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is a statement that throws an exception, whereas `reject` is a function that returns a promise that is rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that returns a promise that is rejected, whereas `reject` is a function that returns a promise that is rejected.

DONE.
