  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() > firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `<=` instead of `>`, which would cause the loop to continue even if `firstLeft` is zero or negative, potentially leading to an infinite loop.
