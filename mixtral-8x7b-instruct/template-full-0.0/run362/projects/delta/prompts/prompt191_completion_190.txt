 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates an empty object instead of copying the properties from `newOp`. This could lead to unexpected results in the rest of the `compose` method, as it relies on the structure of the `newOp` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the `newOp` to null, which would cause a runtime error in the following lines due to attempting to access properties of a null value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `newOp` with `thisOp`, which might not have the correct properties set, especially if the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function or the `compose` method relies on the specific properties of `newOp`.

DONE.
