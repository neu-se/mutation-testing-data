  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.then.bind(this)` would create a new function that is bound to `this`, whereas `this.then` would simply return the `then` method of `this`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.then.call(this)` would call the `then` method of `this` with `this` as the context, whereas `this.then` would simply return the `then` method of `this`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.apply(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.then.apply(this)` would call the `then` method of `this` with `this` as the context and an empty argument list, whereas `this.then` would simply return the `then` method of `this`.
