  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` returns the imaginary part of the complex number, while the modified code fragment `-b` returns the negative of the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` returns the imaginary part of the complex number, while the modified code fragment `b + 1` returns the imaginary part plus 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` returns the imaginary part of the complex number, while the modified code fragment `b * 2` returns the imaginary part multiplied by 2.

DONE.
