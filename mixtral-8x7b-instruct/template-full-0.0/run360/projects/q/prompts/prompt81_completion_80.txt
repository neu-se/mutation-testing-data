 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of running the `task` after all other tasks have been run, it would add an empty array to `nextTick.runAfter`'s argument list, changing the behavior of the unhandled rejection tracking.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
42
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `task` argument with the number 42, causing the function to execute that number instead of the provided function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
process.nextTick
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `task` argument with the `process.nextTick` function, causing the function to execute the `nextTick` function instead of the provided function.

DONE.
