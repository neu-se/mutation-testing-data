  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.hasNext(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasNext` method would be called with a different argument, which could cause the iterator to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasNext` method would be called with a different argument, which could cause the iterator to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekType` method would be called with a different argument, which could cause the iterator to behave differently.

DONE.
