  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('goose', 'gooses')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `plural` function to return the incorrect plural form of the word "goose."

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('goose', 'geese')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `plural` function to return the correct plural form of the word "goose."

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('goose', undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `plural` function to return undefined instead of a plural form of the word "goose."

DONE.
