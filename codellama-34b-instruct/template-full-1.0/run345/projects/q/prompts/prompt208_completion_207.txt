  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `callback.apply(undefined, arguments)` is always called with `this` set to `undefined`, while `callback(arguments)` would call `callback` with `this` set to the global object or `undefined` in strict mode.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(window, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `callback.apply(window, arguments)` would call `callback` with `this` set to the `window` object, while `callback.apply(undefined, arguments)` would call `callback` with `this` set to `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(null, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `callback.apply(null, arguments)` would call `callback` with `this` set to `null`, while `callback.apply(undefined, arguments)` would call `callback` with `this`
