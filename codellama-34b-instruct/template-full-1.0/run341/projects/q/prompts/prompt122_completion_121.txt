  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"myObject"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `in` operator checks for the existence of a property in an object, so the new code would always evaluate to `true` regardless of the value of `myObject`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `in` operator would always evaluate to `false` when the left-hand side is `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `in` operator would always evaluate to `false` when the left-hand side is `undefined`.

DONE.
