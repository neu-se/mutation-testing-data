  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.hasOwnProperty(index)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `in` operator checks the entire prototype chain, while `hasOwnProperty` only checks the object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(this, index)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would ensure that the `hasOwnProperty` method is called with the correct `this` value, avoiding the possibility of incorrect behavior if the `hasOwnProperty` method is overridden.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index >= 0 && index < this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check that the index is within the bounds of the array, while the original code fragment would only check that the index is a valid property name.

DONE.
