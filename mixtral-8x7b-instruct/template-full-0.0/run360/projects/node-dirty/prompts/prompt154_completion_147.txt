 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork(true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `uncork` method is called with a boolean argument instead of a callback function, which might cause the write stream to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork(this);
