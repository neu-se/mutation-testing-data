  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the bearing calculation to use the longitude value instead of the latitude value, which would result in an incorrect bearing value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude + 10
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the bearing calculation to use a modified latitude value, which would result in an incorrect bearing value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the bearing calculation to use a constant value of 0, which would result in an incorrect bearing value.

DONE.
