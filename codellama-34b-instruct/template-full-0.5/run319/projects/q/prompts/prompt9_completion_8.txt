  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define !== "function" && define.amd
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator is used instead of `===`, which would cause the code to enter the `if` block if `define` is not a function and `define.amd` is defined, rather than if `define` is a function and `define.amd` is defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define !== "function" || !define.amd
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator is used instead of `===`, which would cause the code to enter the `if` block if `define` is not a function or `define.amd` is not defined, rather than if `define` is a function and `define.amd` is defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === "function" && !define.amd
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is used instead
