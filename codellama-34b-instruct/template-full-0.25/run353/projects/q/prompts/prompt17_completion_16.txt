  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, but replacing it with `null` would cause the code to throw a `TypeError` instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, but replacing it with `undefined` would cause the code to throw a `TypeError` instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, but replacing it with `0` would cause the code to throw a `TypeError` instead.

DONE.
