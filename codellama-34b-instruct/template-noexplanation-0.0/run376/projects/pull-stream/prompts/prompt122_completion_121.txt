  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
source(null, function (end, data) {
  //if ended immediately, and no initial...
  if(end) return cb(end === true ? null : end)
  acc = data; sink(source)
})
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the `source` function as the argument to `sink`, which may cause the `sink` function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
source(null, function (end, data) {
  //if ended immediately, and no initial...

This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the `acc` variable as the argument to `sink`, which may cause the `sink` function to behave differently.
