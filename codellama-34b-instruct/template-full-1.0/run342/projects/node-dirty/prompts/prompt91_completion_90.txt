  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'warn'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'warn' is a different event name than 'error', which means that the code would not catch errors generated by the database.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'info'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'info' is a different event name than 'error', which means that the code would not catch errors generated by the database.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'debug'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'debug' is a different event name than 'error', which means that the code would not catch errors generated by the database.

DONE.
