  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(aborted)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function is not defined in the original code, so it would throw a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (abortCb) {
  abortCb(aborted)
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the conditional statement checks if `abortCb` is defined, but it would still call the function even if it's not defined, which would throw a reference error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb = () => cb(aborted)
```
This would result in different behavior because it defines `abortCb` as an arrow function that calls `cb` with the `aborted` argument, but the original code defines `abortCb` as a function that takes no arguments.

DONE.
