  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `call` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided individually. Using `array_slice.call(arguments, 1)` would result in a different value being returned than `array_slice(arguments, 1)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.apply(arguments, [1])
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided as an array. Using `array_slice.apply(arguments, [1])` would result in a different value being returned than `array_slice(arguments, 1)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in
