 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basename.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `decodeURIComponent` function would not be able to correctly decode the URI if the filename contains uppercase characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'constant_string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path.basename(pathname)` would not be used, and the `options.dest` would be set to a constant string, regardless of the original `basename`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
request(options)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `request` function would be called before checking if the `options.dest` is an absolute path, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
