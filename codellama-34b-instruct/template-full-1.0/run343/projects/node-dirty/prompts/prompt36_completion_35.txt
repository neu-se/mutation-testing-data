  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, val] = [1, 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the constant values `[1, 2]` are being assigned to key/val instead of the actual values from `this._data.entries()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, val] = this._data.entries().next().value
```
This would result in different behavior because only the first entry from `this._data.entries()` is being assigned to key/val instead of all entries.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, val] = [1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `[1]` is an invalid key/value pair in `this._data`.

DONE.
