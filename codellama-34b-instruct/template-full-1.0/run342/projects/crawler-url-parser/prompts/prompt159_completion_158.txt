  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"/"
```
This would result in different behavior because the URL format will be invalid, causing the parser to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because the URL format will be invalid, causing the parser to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"http://invalid.example.com"
```
This would result in different behavior because the URL will be different from the original URL, causing the parser to return an invalid result.

DONE.
