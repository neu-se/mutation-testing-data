  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the entire `ref` array, while this code fragment returns the first element of the `ref` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the entire `ref` array, while this code fragment returns the second element of the `ref` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the entire `ref` array, while this code fragment returns the third element of the `ref` array.

DONE.
