  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'Warning'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is now different, and any code that depends on the event name may not work correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'info'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is now different, and any code that depends on the event name may not work correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in no change in behavior, because the event name remains the same.

DONE.
