  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return test(data) }
```
This code fragment is a buggy version of the original code, as it always returns the opposite of what the original code would return. This can be used to test the test suite's ability to detect and handle unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return !test(data) && data.length > 0 }
```
This code fragment is a more complex version of the original code, as it checks the length of the data before returning the opposite of the test result. This can be used to test the test suite's ability to handle more complex code and edge cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return test(data) ? data.length : 0 }
```
This code fragment is a different version of the original code, as it returns the length of the data if the test passes, and 0 otherwise. This can be used to test the
