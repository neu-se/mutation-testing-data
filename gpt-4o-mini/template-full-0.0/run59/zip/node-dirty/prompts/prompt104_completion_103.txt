Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete(row.key);
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of setting a value for the key, it removes the key from the data store, leading to loss of data instead of updating it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(row.key, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the value of the key to `null`, which may not be the intended behavior if the original value was meant to be preserved or updated with a valid value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(row.key, 'default');
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the value of the key to a constant string `'default'`, regardless of the actual value intended to be stored, which could lead to incorrect data being saved.

DONE.
