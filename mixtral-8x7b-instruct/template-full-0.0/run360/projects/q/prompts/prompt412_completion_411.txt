 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider the promise as "nearer" if it is in a rejected state, while the original code fragment considers it "nearer" if it is in a fulfilled state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.value === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider the promise as "nearer" if its value is null, while the original code fragment does not have this condition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.hasOwnProperty("value")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider the promise as "nearer" if it has a "value" property, while the original code fragment does not have this condition.

DONE.
