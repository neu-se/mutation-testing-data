  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator would return "object" instead of "undefined" for a null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator would return "undefined" instead of "object" for an undefined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator would return "boolean" instead of "object" for a false value.

DONE.
