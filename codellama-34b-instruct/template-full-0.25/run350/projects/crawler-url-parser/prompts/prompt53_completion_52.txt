  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl, parsedUrl.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pathname` property is not included in the original code fragment, which would cause the `URL.resolve()` method to use the full URL instead of just the path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl.pathname, parsedUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pathname` property is not included in the original code fragment, which would cause the `URL.resolve()` method to use the full URL instead of just the path.

DONE.
