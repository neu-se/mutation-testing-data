  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1[1] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, even if the `attempt1` array has a value at index `1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1[1] === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, even if the `attempt1` array has a value at index `1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1[1] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, even if the `attempt1` array has a value at index `1`.

DONE.
