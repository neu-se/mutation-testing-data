  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `null`, rather than the actual result of the generator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("PLACEHOLDER");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to throw an error, rather than returning the actual result of the generator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spawn(Q.resolve(makeGenerator));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a resolved promise with the result of the generator, rather than returning the result of the generator directly.

DONE.
