  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.of
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.of` creates a new array with a variable number of arguments, whereas `Array.from` creates a new array from an existing array-like or iterable object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.map
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype.map` creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array, whereas `Array.from` creates a new array from an existing array-like or iterable object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype.filter` creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, whereas `Array.from` creates a new array from an existing array-like or iterable object.

DONE.
