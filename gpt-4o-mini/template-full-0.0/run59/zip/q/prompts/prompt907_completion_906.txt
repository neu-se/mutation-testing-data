Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the starting index for slicing the arguments array from 1 to 0, which would include the callback itself in the base arguments instead of excluding it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the starting index for slicing the arguments array from 1 to 2, which would skip the first two arguments and potentially lead to missing required parameters when the function is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it limits the slice to only one element (the second argument), which would not include all the necessary arguments that should be passed to the callback, potentially causing errors or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
