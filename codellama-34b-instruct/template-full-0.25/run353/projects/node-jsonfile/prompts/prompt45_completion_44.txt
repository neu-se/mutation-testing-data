  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, options, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as the third argument to `stringify`, which would cause the function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, options, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be passed as the third argument to `stringify`, which would cause the function to return the string representation of `obj` without any additional formatting.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, options, {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty object would be passed as the third argument to `stringify`, which would cause the function to return the string representation of `obj` with no additional formatting.

DONE.
