  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `elem` variable, which is an object, and the `insert` property of that object. However, if we replace `elem` with `elem.insert`, we are now referring to the `insert` property of the `insert` property of the `elem` object, which is likely not what the developer intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `
