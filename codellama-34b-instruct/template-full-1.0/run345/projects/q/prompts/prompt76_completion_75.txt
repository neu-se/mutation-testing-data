  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestPortTick(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment expects a value to be passed to the `requestPortTick` function, but the modified code does not pass any value, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestPortTick(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment expects a value to be passed to the `requestPortTick` function, but the modified code passes `null` instead, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestPortTick(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment expects a value to be passed to the `requestPortTick` function, but the modified code passes `0` instead, which could cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
