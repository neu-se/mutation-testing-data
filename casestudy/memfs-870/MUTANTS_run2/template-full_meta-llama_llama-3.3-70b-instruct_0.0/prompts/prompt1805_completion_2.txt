Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'w'
```
This would result in different behavior because the file would be opened in write mode instead of read mode, potentially causing data loss or corruption if the file is not intended to be written to.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'wx'
```
This would result in different behavior because the file would be opened in exclusive write mode, which would fail if the file already exists, whereas the original code would open the file in read mode regardless of its existence.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the file would be opened in append mode, which would allow writing to the end of the file, whereas the original code only allows reading from the file.

DONE.
