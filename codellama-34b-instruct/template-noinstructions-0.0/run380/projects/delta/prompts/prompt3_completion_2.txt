  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.assign({}, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.assign` creates a shallow copy of the object, whereas `cloneDeep` creates a deep copy. This means that if `b` contains nested objects or arrays, they will not be cloned properly with `Object.assign`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(b))
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.parse` and `JSON.stringify` are not equivalent to `cloneDeep`. They will not preserve the prototype chain or functions, and they will not handle circular references properly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` creates a shallow copy of the array, whereas `cloneDeep` creates a deep copy. This means that if `b` contains nested arrays or objects, they will not be cloned properly with `slice`.
