  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter` and `otherIter` are different iterators, and `thisIter.next()` would advance the wrong iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next()` without an argument would only advance the iterator by one step, while `otherIter.next(length)` would advance it by `length` steps.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const nextOp = otherIter.next();
ops.push(nextOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not push `nextOp` onto `ops` array, so the resulting array would be different.

DONE.
