  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise", null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `definition` function would not be called, and the promise would not be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise", function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `definition` function would be called with an empty function as its argument, and the promise would not be resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise", function() { throw new Error("Test error"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `definition` function would be called with a function that throws an error, and the promise would be rejected.

DONE.
