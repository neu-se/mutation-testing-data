  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
illness
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "illness" is singular, and the plural form of the word is "illnesses".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
illnesseses
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "illnesses" is already plural, and the plural form of "illnesses" is "illnesseses".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
diseases
```
This would result in different behavior because "diseases" is a different word with a different meaning than "illnesses".

DONE.
