  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
returnsComplex(rand(), rand())
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a random complex number each time the function is called, which would produce a different result than the original code fragment, which always returns the same complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
returnsComplex(this['im'], this['re'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, which would produce a different result than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
returnsComplex(this['im'] + this['re'], this['im'] - this['re'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the real and imaginary parts of the complex number and then subtracts them, which would produce a different result than the original code fragment.

DONE.
