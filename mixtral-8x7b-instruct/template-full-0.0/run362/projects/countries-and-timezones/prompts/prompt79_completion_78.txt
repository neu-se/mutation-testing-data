 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because it directly accesses the `timezones` object using the `tzName` instead of using the `getTimezone` function. This could lead to unexpected results if the `tzName` does not exist in the `timezones` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
timezones['non-existent-tz']
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly accesses the `timezones` object using a hardcoded string 'non-ex
