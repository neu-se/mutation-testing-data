  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"0"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the timeout to be zero, meaning the promise would never be rejected due to a timeout.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"-1"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the timeout to be negative, meaning the promise would be rejected immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"NaN"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the timeout to be Not a Number, meaning the promise would never be rejected due to a timeout.

DONE.
