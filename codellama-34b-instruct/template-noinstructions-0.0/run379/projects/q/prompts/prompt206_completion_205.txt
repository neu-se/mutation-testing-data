  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `fileNameAndLineNumber` is an array, and `undefined` is not an array, so the `if` statement would evaluate to `false` in the original code, but `true` in the mutated code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `fileNameAndLineNumber` is an array, and `length` is a property of arrays, so the `if` statement would evaluate to `false` in the original code, but `true` in the mutated code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber[0] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `fileNameAndLineNumber` is an array, and `undefined` is not an element of the array, so the `if` statement would evaluate to `false` in the original code, but `true` in
