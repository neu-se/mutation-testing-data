  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^\ufeff/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stripBom` function is not being called, and the `content` variable is being modified directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stripBom` function is not being called, and the `content` variable is being sliced to remove the first character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stripBom` function is not being called, and the `content` variable is being substringed to remove the first character.

DONE.
