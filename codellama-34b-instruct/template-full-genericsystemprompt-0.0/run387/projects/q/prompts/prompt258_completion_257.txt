  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(function() { return value; });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method returns a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the callback function, which in this case is `value`. This means that the new promise will be resolved with `value`, even if the original promise was rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(function() { throw new Error(); });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method returns a new promise that is rejected with the error thrown by the callback function. This means that the new promise will be rejected, even if the original promise was resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(function() { return Q.reject(value); });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method returns a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the callback function, which in this case is `
