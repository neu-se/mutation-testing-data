 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer()` creates a new deferred object and returns its promise, while `Promise.resolve` immediately returns a resolved promise. This change would bypass the actual execution of the asynchronous operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { throw new Error('Bypassing the deferred object'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it throws an error instead of creating a deferred object. This would cause the promise to be rejected immediately, rather than waiting for the asynchronous operation to complete.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` is a Q-specific method for creating a resolved promise, while `defer()` creates a new deferred object and returns its promise. This change would bypass the actual execution of the asynchronous operation and create a resolved promise immediately.
