Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basename
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the original basename of the URL instead of the decoded version, which may lead to incorrect file names if the URL contains encoded characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodedBasename.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the decoded basename to uppercase, which could lead to file naming issues on case-sensitive file systems.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodedBasename + '.jpg'
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends a fixed file extension (".jpg") to the decoded basename, potentially overwriting the original file extension and causing issues with file types.

DONE.
