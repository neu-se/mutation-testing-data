 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data => data[field]
```
This would result in different behavior because it assumes `field` is a string and tries to access it as a property of the `data` object, whereas the original `prop` function correctly handles both string and function inputs for `field`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => field
