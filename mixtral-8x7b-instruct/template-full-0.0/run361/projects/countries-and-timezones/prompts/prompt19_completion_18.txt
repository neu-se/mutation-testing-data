 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'0'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` property of the returned object would be an array containing strings instead of arrays of timezone IDs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` property of the returned object would be `null` for countries with timezones, instead of an array of timezone IDs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezonesMap[country].all
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the global `timezonesMap` variable instead of the `tzMap` variable, potentially causing issues if `timezonesMap` is not properly initialized.

DONE.
