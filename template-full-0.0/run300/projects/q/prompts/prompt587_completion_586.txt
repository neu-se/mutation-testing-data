  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator).then(function () { throw new Error("Test error"); });

This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the promise returned by `Q.async`, which would cause the error to be thrown in the next tick of the event loop, rather than immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator).catch(function () { throw new Error("Test error"); });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch` method is called on the promise returned by `Q.async`, which would cause the error to be thrown in the next tick of the event loop, rather than immediately.
