  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `args === undefined` is a different condition than `args == null`. In the original code, `args == null` checks whether `args` is `null` or `undefined`, but `args === undefined` specifically checks whether `args` is `undefined`. If `args` is an empty array, for example, this condition would return `false`, whereas the original condition would return `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.length === 0` checks whether the length of `args` is 0, whereas `args == null` checks whether `args` is `null` or `undefined`. If `args` is an empty array, for example, this condition would return `true`, whereas the original condition would return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray(args)
```
This would
