  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method would be called with a different argument, which could cause the method to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method would be called without any arguments, which could cause the method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method would be called with a different argument, which could cause the method to return a different result.

DONE.
