  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns an array of promises, while the replaced code fragment returns an empty array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns an array of promises, while the replaced code fragment returns null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns an array of promises, while the replaced code fragment returns undefined.

DONE.
