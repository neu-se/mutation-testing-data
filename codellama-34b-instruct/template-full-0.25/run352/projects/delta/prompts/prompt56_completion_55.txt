  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a shallow copy of the array, whereas `ops` is a reference to the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.concat([])
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat()` returns a new array that is the result of concatenating the original array with the given array, whereas `ops` is a reference to the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.filter(() => true)
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter()` returns a new array that contains only the elements that pass the given test function, whereas `ops` is a reference to the original array.

DONE.
