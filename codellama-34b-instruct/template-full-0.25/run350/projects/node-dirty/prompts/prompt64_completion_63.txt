  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy();
```
This would result in different behavior because `destroy()` is a method that immediately destroys the stream, whereas `end()` is a method that gracefully closes the stream after all data has been written.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because `end()` takes an optional argument that specifies the data to be written to the stream before it is closed. Passing `null` as the argument would cause the stream to be closed without writing any data, which could result in unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write('');
```
This would result in different behavior because `write()` is a method that writes data to the stream, whereas `end()` is a method that gracefully closes the stream after all data has been written. Writing an empty string to the stream would not cause the stream to be closed, which could
