  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
createWriteStream(dest + 'temp')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dest` variable is modified, which could cause the file to be written to a different location than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
createWriteStream(dest, { flags: 'a' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flags` option is changed to append to the file instead of overwriting it, which could cause unexpected behavior if the file already exists.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
createWriteStream(dest, { encoding: 'utf8' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `encoding` option is changed to use UTF-8 encoding instead of the default encoding, which could cause issues if the file contains non-ASCII characters.

DONE.
