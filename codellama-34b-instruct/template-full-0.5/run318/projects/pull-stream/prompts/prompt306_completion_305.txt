  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set `ended` to `end`, regardless of whether `end` is truthy or not. In the original code, `ended` is only set to `end` if `end` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = !end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set `ended` to the opposite of `end`, regardless of whether `end` is truthy or not. In the original code, `ended` is only set to `end` if `end` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = end && !last
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only set `ended` to `end` if `end` is truthy and `last` is falsy. In the original code, `ended` is set to `end` if `end` is truthy, regardless of the value
