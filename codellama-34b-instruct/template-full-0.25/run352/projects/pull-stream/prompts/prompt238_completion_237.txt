  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, data
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be called with the wrong arguments, potentially causing the program to crash or produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be called with a null value instead of the expected data, potentially causing the program to crash or produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be called with a null value instead of the expected end value, potentially causing the program to crash or produce incorrect results.

DONE.
