  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello world"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is replaced with a string, which would not have the same properties and methods as the `arguments` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is replaced with an empty array, which would not have the same properties and methods as the `arguments` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is replaced with `null`, which would not have the same properties and methods as the `arguments` object.

DONE.
