  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toLowerCase()
```
This change will cause the `matches` method to always return `false`, as the `path` variable is not modified by the `toLowerCase()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.substring(1)
```
This change will cause the `matches` method to always return `false`, as the `path` variable is not modified by the `substring()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This change will cause the `matches` method to always return `false`, as the `path` variable is not modified by the `split()`, `reverse()`, and `join()` methods.

DONE.
