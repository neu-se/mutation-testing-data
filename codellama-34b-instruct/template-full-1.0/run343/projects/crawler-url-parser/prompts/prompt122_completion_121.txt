  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.entries()
```
This would result in different behavior because entries() returns an iterator of [key, value] pairs, while values() returns an iterator of the values contained in the map. In the context of the code, if the PLACEHOLDER is replaced with entries(), the callback function passed to map() would receive two arguments: the key-value pair, and the index of the iteration. The current implementation relies on the callback function receiving a single argument, the value of the map, which would be lost if the PLACEHOLDER is replaced with entries().

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because keys() returns an iterator of the keys of the map, while values() returns an iterator of the values contained in the map. In the context of the code, if the PLACEHOLDER is replaced with keys(), the callback function passed to map() would receive the key of the map as its argument, rather than the value. The current implementation relies on
