  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at index 1 instead of 0, which would skip the first element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at index -1 instead of 0, which would cause an error because -1 is not a valid index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = this.regex.props.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at the last index of the array instead of the first, which would cause the loop to iterate in reverse order.

DONE.
