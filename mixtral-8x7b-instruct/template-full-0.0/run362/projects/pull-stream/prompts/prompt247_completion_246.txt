 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err && abort, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nextChunk()` function would only be called when there is an error and the `abort` condition is true. In contrast, the original code calls `nextChunk()` when there is no error or the `abort` condition is true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, abort)
