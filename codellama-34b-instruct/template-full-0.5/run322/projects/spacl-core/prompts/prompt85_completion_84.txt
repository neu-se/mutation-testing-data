  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(rule) => rule.clone(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method would be called with a `null` argument, which would cause the method to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(rule) => rule.clone(rule)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method would be called with the same rule as the argument, which would cause the method to return a clone of the rule, rather than a clone of the policy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(rule) => rule.clone(this.name)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method would be called with the name of the policy as the argument, which would cause the method to return a clone of the policy, rather than a clone of the rule.

DONE.
