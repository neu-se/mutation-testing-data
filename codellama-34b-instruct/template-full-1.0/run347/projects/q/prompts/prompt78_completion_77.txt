  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be calling the `flush` function with an incorrect argument, which is likely to cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush()
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be calling the `flush` function immediately, rather than passing it as an argument to `setTimeout`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setTimeout` function would be called with a different delay argument, which could cause the `flush` function to be executed at a different time.

DONE.
