  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` is a function that resolves a promise with a value, whereas `Q.reject` is a function that rejects a promise with a reason. In the original code, `Q.reject` is used to reject the promise with an error, but if we replace it with `Q.resolve`, the promise will be resolved with the error instead of rejected, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that rejects a promise with a reason, but if we replace it with `Q.reject(null)`, the promise will be rejected with a null value instead of an error, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("Custom
