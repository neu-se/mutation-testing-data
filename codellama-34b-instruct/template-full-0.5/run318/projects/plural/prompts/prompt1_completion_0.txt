  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.toString().slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString` is a function that returns a string representation of the object, while `obj.toString()` is a method that returns the string representation of the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `obj.slice` is a method that returns a shallow copy of the object, while `Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).slice` is a method that returns a string representation of the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.toString().split(' ').slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `obj.toString().split(' ')` returns an array of strings, while `Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).slice` returns a string representation of the object.

DONE.
