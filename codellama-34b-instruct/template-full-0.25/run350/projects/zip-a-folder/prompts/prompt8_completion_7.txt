  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath !== src
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the code to proceed even if the target base path and source path are the same, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.length === src.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the code to proceed even if the target base path and source path have the same length, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.startsWith(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the code to proceed even if the target base path starts with the source path, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

DONE.
