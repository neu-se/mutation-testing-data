  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets the value of the map entry to the `policy` object, while the new code fragment sets the value to `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets the value of the map entry to the `policy` object, while the new code fragment sets the value to `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Policy()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets the value of the map entry to the `policy` object, while the new code fragment sets the value to a new `Policy` object.

DONE.
