 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
for (let verb of verbs) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it iterates over the verbs using `let` instead of `const`, allowing the `verb` variable to be reassigned in each iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
for (const [index, verb] of verbs.entries()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses destructuring and the `entries()` method to iterate over the verbs, which would provide the index along with the verb.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
for (const verb of Array.from(verbs)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the `verbs` array-like object into a real array using `Array.from()`, which might have unintended side effects depending on the context.

DONE.
