  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all()` returns a promise that resolves when all of the promises in the input array have resolved, whereas `Q` returns a promise that resolves when the input promise has resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when()` returns a promise that resolves when the input promise has resolved, whereas `Q` returns a promise that resolves when the input promise has resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.spread()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.spread()` returns a promise that resolves when the input promise has resolved, whereas `Q` returns a promise that resolves when the input promise has resolved.

DONE.
