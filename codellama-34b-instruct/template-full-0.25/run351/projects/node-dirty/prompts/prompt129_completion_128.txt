  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `this._writeStream.cork(<PLACEHOLDER>);`, which means that the `cork` method is being called with a placeholder argument, which is intended to be replaced with a real argument later. However, if we replace the placeholder with `null`, it would cause the `cork` method to be called with a null argument, which would likely result in an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork(this._queue.size);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `this._writeStream.cork(<PLACEHOLDER>);`, which means that the `cork` method is being called with a placeholder argument, which is intended to be replaced with a real argument later. However, if we replace the placeholder with `this._queue.size`, it would cause the `cork` method
