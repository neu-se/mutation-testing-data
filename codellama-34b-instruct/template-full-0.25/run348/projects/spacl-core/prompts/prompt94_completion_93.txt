  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the policy name to lowercase, which could potentially cause the `get()` method to return a different policy than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property would return the number of characters in the policy name, which could potentially cause the `get()` method to return a different policy than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name.split(' ')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method would split the policy name into an array of substrings, and the `[0]` index would return the first substring, which could potentially cause the `get()` method to return a different policy than expected.

DONE.
