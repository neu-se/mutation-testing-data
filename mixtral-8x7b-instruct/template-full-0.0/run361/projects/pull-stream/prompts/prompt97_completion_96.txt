 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ended
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.ended` might refer to a different `ended` variable in the outer scope, or a property of the current object, instead of the local `ended` variable in the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.ended
```
This would result in different behavior because `data.ended` would check for a property `ended` in the `data` object, instead of the local `ended` variable in the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
drain.ended
```
This would result in different behavior because `drain.ended` would check for a property `ended` in the `drain` function, instead of the local `ended` variable in the function.

DONE.
