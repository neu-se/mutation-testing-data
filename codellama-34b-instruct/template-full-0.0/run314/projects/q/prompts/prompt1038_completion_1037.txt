  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a new deferred object and returns it, while this replacement creates a new deferred object, resolves it immediately, and returns the resolved value. This could cause the `put` method to behave differently, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a new deferred object and returns it, while this replacement creates a new deferred object, rejects it immediately, and returns the rejected value. This could cause the `put` method to behave differently, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a new deferred object and returns it, while this replacement creates a new deferred object and returns its promise. This could cause the `
