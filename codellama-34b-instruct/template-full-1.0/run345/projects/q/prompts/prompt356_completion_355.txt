  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a function that returns a promise that is resolved with the given value, whereas `reject` is a function that returns a promise that is rejected with the given value. Using `resolve` instead of `reject` would result in the promise being resolved with the rejected value, which could potentially mask the error and cause unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject("error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with a different reason than the original code fragment. This could potentially cause changes in the behavior of the program, depending on how the rejection is handled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(new Error("error message"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with a different error than the original code fragment. This could potentially cause changes in the behavior of the program, depending on how the rejection is handled.
