  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.npost
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `Q` object, while the new code fragment is a reference to the `Q.npost` method. This could cause the code to behave differently if the `Q` object is not defined or if the `Q.npost` method is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.ninvoke
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `Q` object, while the new code fragment is a reference to the `Q.ninvoke` method. This could cause the code to behave differently if the `Q` object is not defined or if the `Q.ninvoke` method is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nbind
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `Q` object, while the new code fragment is a reference to
