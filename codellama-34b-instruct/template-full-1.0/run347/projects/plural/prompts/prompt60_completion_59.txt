  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterion'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment correctly handled the plural form of "criteria" by adding an "s" to the end of the word, while this new code fragment would only add an "s" to the end of "criterion".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterions'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment correctly handled the plural form of "criteria" by adding an "s" to the end of the word, while this new code fragment would add an extra "s" to the end of "criterion".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterionz'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment correctly handled the plural form of "criteria" by adding an "s" to the end of the word, while this new code fragment would add a different suffix to the end of "criterion".
