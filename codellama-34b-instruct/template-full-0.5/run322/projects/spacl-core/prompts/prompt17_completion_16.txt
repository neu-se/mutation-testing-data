  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
compile.replace(/^/g, '');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method will replace the first character of the `spec` string with an empty string, which would cause the `match` method to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
compile.replace(/^\//g, '');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method will replace the first character of the `spec` string with an empty string, which would cause the `match` method to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
compile.replace(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]/g, '');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method will replace any character that matches the regular expression with an empty string, which would cause the `match` method to fail.

DONE.
