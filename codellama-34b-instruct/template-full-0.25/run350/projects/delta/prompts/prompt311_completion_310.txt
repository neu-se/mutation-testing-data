  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at index 1 instead of 0, potentially skipping the first element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at index -1, potentially causing an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at index 0, but the increment would be double the original value, potentially skipping over some elements in the array.

DONE.
