  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a valid expression that evaluates to `undefined`, while `null` is a distinct value that can be used as a placeholder.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a valid expression that evaluates to `undefined`, while `undefined` is a distinct value that can be used as a placeholder.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a valid expression that evaluates to `undefined`, while `NaN` is a distinct value that can be used as a placeholder.

DONE.
