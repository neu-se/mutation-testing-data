 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the imaginary part will always be positive, regardless of the sign of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
minus
```
This would result in different behavior because the number of minuses will be added to the imaginary part, instead of just the sign.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because a random number will be added to the imaginary part, instead of the intended value.

DONE.
