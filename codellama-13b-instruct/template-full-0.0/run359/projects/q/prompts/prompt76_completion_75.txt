  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port2.postMessage(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `postMessage` method is called with a non-empty message, which would cause the `onmessage` event handler to be triggered.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port2.postMessage(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `postMessage` method is called with a `null` message, which would cause the `onmessage` event handler to not be triggered.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port2.postMessage(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `postMessage` method is called with an `undefined` message, which would cause the `onmessage` event handler to not be triggered.

DONE.
