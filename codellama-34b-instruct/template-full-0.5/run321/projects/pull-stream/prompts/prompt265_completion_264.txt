  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the `data` variable, which may be a non-null value, while the new code fragment always returns `null`, which may cause the function to behave differently in certain situations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the `data` variable, which may be a defined value, while the new code fragment always returns `undefined`, which may cause the function to behave differently in certain situations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the `data` variable, which may be an array with elements, while the new code fragment always returns an empty array, which may cause the function to behave differently in certain situations.

DONE.
