  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the program to exit with a non-zero status code, indicating an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the program to exit with a zero status code, indicating success.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(Math.random());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the program to exit with a random status code, which could be either zero or non-zero.

DONE.
