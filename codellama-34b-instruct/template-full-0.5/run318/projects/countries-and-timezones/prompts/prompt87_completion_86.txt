  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry(tzName, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a country object instead of an array of country objects, which is what the original code expects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezonesForCountry(tzName, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of timezone objects instead of a country object, which is what the original code expects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountriesForTimezone(tzName, options).length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the array of country objects instead of the array of country objects itself, which is what the original code expects.

DONE.
