 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.exit(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the script would terminate immediately, not waiting for the async operation to complete.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the callback with a null error, indicating successful completion, even if the mapper function encounters an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map(data, function (err, data) {
  busy = false;
  throw new Error('Something went wrong');
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force an error to be thrown, bypassing the error handling and propagating the error to the caller.

DONE.
