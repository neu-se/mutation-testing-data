 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice.call(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array from the arguments object, whereas the original code uses the `array_slice` function which might have some custom behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.keys(arguments)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the first property name from the arguments object, which is not equivalent to slicing the arguments object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Reflect.apply(Function.prototype.call, arguments, [].slice.call(arguments, 1))
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Reflect.apply` method to call the `Function.prototype.call` method with the `arguments` object, which is not equivalent to slicing the arguments object.

DONE.
