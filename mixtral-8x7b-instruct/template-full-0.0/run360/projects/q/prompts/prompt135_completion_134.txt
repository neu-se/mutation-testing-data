 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'[object Object]'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isStopIteration` function would always return true, since the string comparison would always be true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the type comparison would always be false, causing the `isStopIteration` function to always return false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the return value would be random, causing the `isStopIteration` function to have inconsistent results.

DONE.
