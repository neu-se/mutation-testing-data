  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value in JavaScript, and it would be passed as an argument to the `progressed` function, which could potentially cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a valid value in JavaScript, and it would be passed as an argument to the `progressed` function, which could potentially cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because `true` is a valid value in JavaScript, and it would be passed as an argument to the `progressed` function, which could potentially cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
