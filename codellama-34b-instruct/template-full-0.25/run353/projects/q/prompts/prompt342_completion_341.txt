  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(_fulfilled(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_fulfilled` function is not defined in the provided code snippet, so the code would throw a `ReferenceError` and fail to execute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_fulfilled` function is not defined in the provided code snippet, so the code would throw a `ReferenceError` and fail to execute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` method is not defined in the provided code snippet, so the code would throw a `ReferenceError` and fail to execute.

DONE.
