  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment is a constant value, while the original code fragment is a reference to a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment is an empty array, while the original code fragment is a reference to a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment is a null value, while the original code fragment is a reference to a function.

DONE.
