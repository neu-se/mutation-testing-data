  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self
```
This would result in different behavior because `self` refers to the `self` variable, which is not defined in this scope. This change would result in a `ReferenceError` being thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments[0]` would refer to the first argument passed to the `makeGenerator` function, which is not the same as `this` and `arguments` in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an object and does not have properties that can be accessed like `this` and `arguments`. This change would result in a `TypeError` being thrown when the `continuer.bind` method is called.

DONE.
