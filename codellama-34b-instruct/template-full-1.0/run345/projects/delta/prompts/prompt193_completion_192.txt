  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the while loop to continue iterating even if the next operation in `otherIter` is a delete operation, which is not the case with the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the while loop to continue iterating even if the length of the next operation in `otherIter` is zero, which is not the case with the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the while loop to continue iterating even if the length of the next operation in `thisIter` is zero, which is not the case with the original code fragment.

DONE.
