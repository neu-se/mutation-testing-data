  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, null, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `undefined`, and it would cause the `set` method to treat the key as if it were being deleted, rather than updated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, 'undefined', cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the string `'undefined'` is not the same as the `undefined` value, and it would cause the `set` method to treat the key as if it were being updated with a string value, rather than being deleted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, NaN, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a different value than `undefined`, and it would cause the `set` method to treat the key as if it were being updated with a non-numeric value, rather than being deleted.

DONE.
