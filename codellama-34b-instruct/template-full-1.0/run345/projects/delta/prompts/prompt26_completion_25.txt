  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of the values of an object, rather than an array of its keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys.map(key => key * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys.map(key => key * 2)` would map each key to a new value, rather than returning an array of keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values.map(value => value * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values.map(value => value * 2)` would map each value to a new value, rather than returning an array of values.

DONE.
