  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^\uFEFF/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stripBom` function is not being called, which could cause issues with parsing JSON files that have a UTF-8 BOM (Byte Order Mark) at the beginning.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^\uFEFF/, '').trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trim` function is being called on the content before it is parsed, which could cause issues with parsing JSON files that have whitespace at the beginning or end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^\uFEFF/, '').toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase` function is being called on the content before it is parsed, which could cause issues with parsing JSON files that have uppercase characters.

DONE.
