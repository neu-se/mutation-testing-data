  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(reject(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is called instead of `resolve`, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(fulfill(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill` is called instead of `resolve`, which would cause the promise to be fulfilled instead of resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(Q(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q` is called instead of `resolve`, which would cause the promise to be resolved with a new promise instead of the original value.

DONE.
