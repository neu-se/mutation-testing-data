Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_lastIndexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_lastIndexOf` may not be defined or may return the last index of the element instead of the first, leading to incorrect handling of the reported unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_indexOf(reportedUnhandledRejections, promise) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because adding 1 to the index would cause the code to incorrectly reference the next element in the array, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds error or incorrect reporting of the rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_indexOf(unhandledRejections, promise) === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because checking for equality with 0 would only trigger the emission of the "rejectionHandled" event if the promise is the first in the list, ignoring other promises that may also need to be reported.

DONE.
