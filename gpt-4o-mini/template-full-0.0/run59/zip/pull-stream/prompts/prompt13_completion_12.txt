Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it increments `i` by 2 instead of 1, causing the loop to skip every other argument, which may lead to missing some arguments when constructing the `args` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because it decrements `i` instead of incrementing it, which would create an infinite loop since `i` would never reach the length of the arguments, preventing the loop from terminating.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = length
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets `i` to the value of `length`, causing the loop to terminate immediately without executing any iterations, resulting in an empty `args` array.

DONE.
