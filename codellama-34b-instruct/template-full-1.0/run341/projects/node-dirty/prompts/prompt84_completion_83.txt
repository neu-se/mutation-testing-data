  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\r\n
```
This would result in different behavior because a different line terminator would be used, causing issues with parsing the data stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\n\n'
```
This would result in different behavior because two line terminators would be used, causing an extra empty line to be written to the data stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\n' + key
```
This would result in different behavior because the key would be added to the end of each line, causing data to be written in an unexpected format and potentially causing parsing issues.

DONE.
