  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fail
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fail` is a method that rejects a promise with a reason, whereas `Q.done` is a method that resolves a promise with a value. Using `Q.fail` instead of `Q.done` would cause the promise to be rejected, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the surrounding code.

DONE.
