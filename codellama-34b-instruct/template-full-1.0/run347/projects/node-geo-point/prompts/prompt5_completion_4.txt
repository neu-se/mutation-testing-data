  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(typeof point !== "object" || point === null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used the `isObject` function, which checks if a variable is an object or not, while this replacement code uses the `typeof` operator, which returns the type of a variable as a string. This means that the replacement code would not produce the same results as the original code, and could potentially introduce a bug into the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(point.hasOwnProperty('type') && point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checked if the `point` object has both the `type` and `coordinates` properties, while this replacement code checks if the `point` object has only one of the two properties. This means that the replacement code would not produce the same results as the original code, and could potentially introduce a bug into the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
