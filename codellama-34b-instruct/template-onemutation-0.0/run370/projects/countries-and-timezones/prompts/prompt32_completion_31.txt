  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getNumStr(min)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `getNumStr(min)` is called with the argument `min`, which is a number, while the new code fragment `getNumStr(min)` is called with the argument `min`, which is a string. This would cause the function `getNumStr` to behave differently when it is called with a string argument, which could potentially cause the test suite to fail.

DONE.
