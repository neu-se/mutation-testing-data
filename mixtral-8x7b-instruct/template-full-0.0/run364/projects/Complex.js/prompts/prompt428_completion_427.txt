 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
places > 0 ? places : 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `places` argument would always be at least 1, which could lead to unexpected rounding or truncation in the `ceil`, `floor`, and `round` methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
places < 0 ? places : -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `places` argument would be set to -1 if it's a negative number, which could lead to incorrect results or errors in the `ceil`, `floor`, and `round` methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
places * Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `places` argument would be multiplied by a random number, causing unpredictable and inconsistent results in the `ceil`, `floor`, and `round` methods.

DONE.
