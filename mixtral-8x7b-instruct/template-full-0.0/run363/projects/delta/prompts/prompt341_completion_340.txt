 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
new OpIterator(slice.ops).next.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it will not have the correct `this` context when called, causing potential issues in the code that relies on the correct context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
(<any>new OpIterator(slice.ops)).next
```
This would result in different behavior because it casts the `OpIterator(slice.ops)` to `any`, bypassing the TypeScript type checking, which might cause runtime errors if the `next` method is not present or has different behavior in the actual object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
new OpIterator(slice.ops).next.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly sets the `this` context to `null`, which might cause issues if the `next` method relies on the `this` context being the `
