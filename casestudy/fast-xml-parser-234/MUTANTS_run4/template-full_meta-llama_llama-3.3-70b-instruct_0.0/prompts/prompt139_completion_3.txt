Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/[a-zA-Z]+/, ""
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove any alphabetic characters from the string instead of removing leading zeros after a decimal point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/\d+/, "0"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace all digits in the string with the character "0", instead of removing leading zeros after a decimal point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/\./, ","
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the decimal point in the string with a comma, instead of removing leading zeros after a decimal point.

DONE.
