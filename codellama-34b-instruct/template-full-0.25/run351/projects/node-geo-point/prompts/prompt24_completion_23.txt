  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty.call(object, 'longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasOwnProperty` is a method of the `Object.prototype` and is not a property of the `object` itself. Using `call` to invoke the method with `object` as the `this` value ensures that the method is called on the correct object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(object, 'longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty` is a method of the `Object.prototype` and is not a property of the `object` itself. Using `call` to invoke the method with `object` as the `this` value ensures that the method is called on the correct object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty('longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior
