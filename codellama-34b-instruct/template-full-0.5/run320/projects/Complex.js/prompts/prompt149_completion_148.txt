  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if either `this` or `z` is infinite, while this new code fragment checks if both `this` and `z` are infinite. This change could cause the `mul` method to return `Complex['INFINITY']` when it should return `Complex['NAN']`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']() || a === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if either `this` or `z` is infinite, while this new code fragment checks if either `this`, `z`, or `a` is infinite. This change could cause the `mul` method to return `Complex['INFINITY']` when it should return `Complex['NAN']`.
