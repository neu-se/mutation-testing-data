  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb
```
This would result in different behavior because `!cb` is the logical NOT operator in JavaScript, which negates the value of `cb`. If `cb` is truthy, `!cb` is falsey and vice versa. In the original code, `cb` is passed as a parameter to `read`, which is assumed to be a function that takes a callback as an argument. By negating `cb`, we are effectively passing a falsey value to `read`, which may cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value in JavaScript that represents the absence of any object value. If `cb` is expected to be a function, passing `null` instead may cause the code to throw an error when it tries to call the `null` value as a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `
