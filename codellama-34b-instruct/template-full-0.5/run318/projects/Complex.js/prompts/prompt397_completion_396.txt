  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['asin']();
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['asin']` is a method call, while `this['asin']()` is a function call, and the function call may return a different value than the method call.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['asin'] + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['asin'] + 1` is a different expression than `this['asin']`, and may produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['asin'] * 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['asin'] * 2` is a different expression than `this['asin']`, and may produce a different result.

DONE.
