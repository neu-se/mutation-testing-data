  Option 1:

The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object['defineProperty']
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.defineProperty` is a
built-in function in JavaScript that defines a new property directly on an
object, whereas `Object['defineProperty']` is a string literal that evaluates
to the same value, but could potentially be overwritten or shadowed by another
variable with the same name.

Option 2:

The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.defineProperty()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.defineProperty()` is a
function call that creates a new object property with the specified name and
value, whereas `Object.defineProperty` is a function that defines a new
property directly on an object.

Option 3:

The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.defineProperty()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.defineProperty()`
is a function call that creates a new property on the `Object.prototype` object,
