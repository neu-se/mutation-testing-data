  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isRelative
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.isRelative` checks if the path is relative, while `path.isAbsolute` checks if the path is absolute. If the path is relative, the code would not work as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isFile
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.isFile` checks if the path is a file, while `path.isAbsolute` checks if the path is absolute. If the path is a file, the code would not work as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isDirectory
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.isDirectory` checks if the path is a directory, while `path.isAbsolute` checks if the path is absolute. If the path is a directory, the code would not work as intended.

DONE.
