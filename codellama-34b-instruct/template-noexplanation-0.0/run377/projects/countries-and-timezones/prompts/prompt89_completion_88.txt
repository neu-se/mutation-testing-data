  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated
```
This change will cause the `getCountryForTimezone` function to always return `null`, as the `options` object will never have a `deprecated` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = true
```
This change will cause the `getCountryForTimezone` function to always return the first country in the `countries` object, as the `options` object will always have a `deprecated` property set to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = !options.deprecated
```
This change will cause the `getCountryForTimezone` function to toggle the `deprecated` property of the `options` object every time it is called, which will result in unpredictable behavior.

DONE.
