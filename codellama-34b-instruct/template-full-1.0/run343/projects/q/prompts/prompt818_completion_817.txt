  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, so it would throw a `TypeError` if `fulfilled` is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, so it would throw a `TypeError` if `fulfilled` is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty function would not throw an error if `fulfilled` is called, but it would also not have any effect.

DONE.
