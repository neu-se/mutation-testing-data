  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.delete === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator would now be comparing the `delete` property to a string, rather than a number. This could potentially cause the `length` function to return a different value, depending on the value of the `delete` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` property would now be compared to `undefined`, rather than a number. This could potentially cause the `length` function to return a different value, depending on whether the `delete` property is defined or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` property would now be compared to a number greater than 0, rather than a number. This could potentially cause the `length` function to return a different value, depending on the value of the `delete` property
