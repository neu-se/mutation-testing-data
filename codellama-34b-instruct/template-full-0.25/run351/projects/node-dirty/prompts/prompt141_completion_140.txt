  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'write'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `write` event is emitted when data is written to the stream, whereas the `error` event is emitted when an error occurs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` event is emitted when the stream is closed, whereas the `error` event is emitted when an error occurs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` event is emitted when the stream is drained, whereas the `error` event is emitted when an error occurs.

DONE.
