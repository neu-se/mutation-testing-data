  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the imaginary part is equal to 0, while the new code fragment checks if it is not equal to 0. This change would cause the `valueOf` method to return `null` when the imaginary part is not 0, which is different from the original behavior.

DONE.
