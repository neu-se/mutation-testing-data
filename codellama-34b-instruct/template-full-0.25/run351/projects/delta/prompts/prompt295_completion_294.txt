  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance to the next element, potentially skipping over important operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.prev()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to move backward, potentially revisiting operations that have already been processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to return the next element without advancing the iterator, potentially leading to an infinite loop.

DONE.
