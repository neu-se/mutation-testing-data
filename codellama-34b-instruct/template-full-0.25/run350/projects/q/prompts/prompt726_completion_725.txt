  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
snapshot.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the "fulfilled" state, while this replacement checks for the "rejected" state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect(<PLACEHOLDER>).state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the "fulfilled" state, while this replacement checks for the "pending" state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect(<PLACEHOLDER>).state === "settled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the "fulfilled" state, while this replacement checks for the "settled" state, which includes both "fulfilled" and "rejected" states.

DONE.
