  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['abs'] < 0 && a['arg'] > 0
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the less-than operator instead of the not operator. This change will cause the function to return a different result for certain inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['abs'] > 0 && a['arg'] < 0
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the greater-than operator instead of the not operator. This change will cause the function to return a different result for certain inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['abs'] === 0 && a['arg'] === 0
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the equality operator instead of the not operator. This change will cause the function to return a different result for certain inputs.

DONE.
