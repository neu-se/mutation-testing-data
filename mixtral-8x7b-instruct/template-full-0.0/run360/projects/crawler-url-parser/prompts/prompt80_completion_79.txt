 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'attr'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the attribute named "attr" instead of the actual attribute specified by the "href" variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
($(this).attr('data-href') || $(this).attr('href'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prioritize the "data-href" attribute over the "href" attribute, potentially causing incorrect URL extraction.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$(this).prop('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the actual value of the "href" property instead of the attribute value, which might not be normalized or might not include the base URL in some cases.

DONE.
