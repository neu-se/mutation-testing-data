  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length !== 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `point` object has the `type` and `coordinates` properties, while the modified code checks the length of the `coordinates` array. If the `coordinates` array has a different length than 2, the modified code would throw an error, while the original code would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length < 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `point` object has the `type` and `coordinates` properties, while the modified code checks if the length of the `coordinates` array is less than 2. If the `coordinates` array has a length less than 2, the modified code would throw an error, while the original code would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!point.coordinates
```
This would result in different
