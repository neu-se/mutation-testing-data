  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.sqrt` function computes the square root of a number, whereas `Math.pow` computes the value of a number raised to a power. This change would cause the calculation of the tile coordinates to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 ** zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow` function computes the value of a number raised to a power, whereas the `**` operator raises a number to a power. This change would cause the calculation of the tile coordinates to produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.random` function returns a random number between 0 and 1, whereas the `Math.pow` function computes the value of a number raised to a power. This change would cause the calculation of the tile coordinates to produce incorrect and nons
