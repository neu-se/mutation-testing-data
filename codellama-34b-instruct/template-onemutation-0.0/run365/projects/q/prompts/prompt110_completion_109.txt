  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[i] !== value
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for inequality, whereas the `===` operator checks for equality. This change would cause the `array_indexOf` function to return a different index value, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the surrounding code.
