  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromCallback` is a different function than `universalify.fromPromise`, and it may not handle errors or non-promise-returning functions in the same way.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function and would cause an error to be thrown when `_writeFile` is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('test')
```
This would result in different behavior because an error would be thrown when `_writeFile` is called, potentially causing the program to crash.

DONE.
