  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, data
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a pass-through stream that doesn't change the value, while this code fragment would pass the `end` and `data` arguments to the `read` function, which could potentially change the behavior of the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a pass-through stream that doesn't change the value, while this code fragment would pass the `end` and `null` arguments to the `read` function, which could potentially change the behavior of the stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a pass-through stream that doesn't change the value, while this code fragment would pass the `end` and `undefined` arguments to the `read` function, which could potentially change the behavior of the stream.
