  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.message
```
This would result in different behavior because the `message` property of the `exception` object is not necessarily the same as the `exception` object itself, and could potentially lead to different error handling or debugging behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(exception.message)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Error` constructor creates a new error object with the specified message, which could potentially lead to different error handling or debugging behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stack` property of the `exception` object contains the stack trace of the error, which could potentially lead to different error handling or debugging behavior.

DONE.
