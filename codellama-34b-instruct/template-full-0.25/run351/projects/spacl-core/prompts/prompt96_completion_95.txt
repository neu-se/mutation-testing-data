  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name, this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the current instance of the `PolicyMap` class, whereas `policy` refers to the `Policy` object being added to the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name, null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `policy`, and would cause the `set` method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value than `policy`, and would cause the `set` method to behave differently.

DONE.
