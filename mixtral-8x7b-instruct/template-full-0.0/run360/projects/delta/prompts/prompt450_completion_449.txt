 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
typeof op.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `op.retain` is a string, while the original code checks if it's an object or a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
op.retain !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `op.retain` is not undefined, while the original code checks if it's an object, a number, or a specific string format.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
typeof op.retain === 'object' && op.retain !== null && op.retain.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `op.retain` is an object with a length greater than 0, while the original code checks if it's an object, a number, or a specific string format.

DONE.
