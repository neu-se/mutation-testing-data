  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `undefined`, even if the promise is resolved with a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("foo")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always throw an error, even if the promise is resolved with a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different value each time the function is called, even if the promise is resolved with a value.

DONE.
