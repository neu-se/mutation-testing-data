  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value, so it will not be coerced to a string, unlike `key`, which is a string primitive. As a result, the `JSON.stringify()` method will produce a different output when called with `undefined` as its argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that represents the absence of any object value, whereas `key` is a string primitive that has a specific value. As a result, the `JSON.stringify()` method will produce a different output when called with `null` as its argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because `''` is the empty string, which is a falsy value in JavaScript. As a result, the `JSON.stringify()` method will not include the key-value pair in the output object when called with `''
