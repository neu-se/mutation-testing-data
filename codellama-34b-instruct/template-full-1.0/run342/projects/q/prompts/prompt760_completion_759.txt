  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_reduce
```
This would result in different behavior because array_map and array_reduce have different return values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.map
```
This would result in different behavior because Q.map and array_map have different return values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect
```
This would result in different behavior because promise.inspect and Q.inspect have different return values.

DONE.
