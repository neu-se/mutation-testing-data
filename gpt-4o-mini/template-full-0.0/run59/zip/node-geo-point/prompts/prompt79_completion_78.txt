Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the longitude value instead of the latitude value, which would lead to incorrect calculations for the destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude + 10
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 10 to the latitude value, which would incorrectly shift the calculated destination point northward by approximately 1.11 degrees (10/111.32 km).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the latitude with a constant value of 0, which would lead to all destination calculations being based on the equator, regardless of the original latitude of the coordinate.

DONE.
