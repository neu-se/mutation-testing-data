  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Map` constructor would throw a `TypeError` when `null` is passed as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Map` constructor would throw a `TypeError` when `undefined` is passed as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Map` constructor would create an empty map when `{}` is passed as an argument, which is different from the original code where `key` is passed as an argument.

DONE.
