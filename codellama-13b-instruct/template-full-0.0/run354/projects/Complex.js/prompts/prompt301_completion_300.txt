  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cosh(b)` returns the hyperbolic cosine of `b`, while `Math.cos(b)` returns the regular cosine of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cosh(b)` returns the hyperbolic cosine of `b`, while `Math.sin(b)` returns the regular sine of `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cosh(b)` returns the hyperbolic cosine of `b`, while `Math.tan(b)` returns the regular tangent of `b`.

DONE.
