  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_filter` returns a new array with only the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, while `array_map` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_reduce
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_reduce` applies a function against an accumulator and each value of the array (from left-to-right) to reduce it to a single value, while `array_map` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_find
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_find` returns the value of the first element in the provided array that satisfies the provided testing function, while `array_map` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every
