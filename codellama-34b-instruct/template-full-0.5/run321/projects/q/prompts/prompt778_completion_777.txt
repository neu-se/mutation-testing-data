  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect(rejection);
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejection` is an object, and `promise.inspect` expects a function as its argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect(rejection.message);
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejection.message` is a string, and `promise.inspect` expects a function as its argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect(function () { return rejection; });
```
This would result in different behavior because the function passed to `promise.inspect` returns `rejection`, which is an object, and `promise.inspect` expects a function as its argument.

DONE.
