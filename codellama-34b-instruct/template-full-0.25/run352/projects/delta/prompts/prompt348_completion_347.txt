  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData, baseOpData[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first element of `baseOpData`, whereas the original code fragment considers the entire `baseOpData` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData[0], baseOpData
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first element of `opData`, whereas the original code fragment considers the entire `opData` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData[0], baseOpData[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first element of both `opData` and `baseOpData`, whereas the original code fragment considers the entire arrays.

DONE.
