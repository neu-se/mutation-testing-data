  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define !== "function" && define.amd
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation operator `!` would cause the code to execute the `define.amd` branch even if `define` is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === "undefined" && define.amd
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator would return `undefined` if `define` is not defined, and the code would attempt to access the `amd` property of `define` even if it is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
define.amd && typeof define !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would attempt to access the `amd` property of `define` even if `define` is not a function.

DONE.
