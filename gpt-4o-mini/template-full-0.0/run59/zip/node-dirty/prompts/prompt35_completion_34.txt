Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, null, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because using `null` instead of `undefined` would cause the `set` method to store `null` as a value for the key instead of deleting it from the `_data` map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, 'deleted', cb
```
This would result in different behavior because setting the value to the string `'deleted'` would store that string in the `_data` map instead of removing the key, which could lead to incorrect data being retained.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, undefined, null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` as the callback would mean that no callback function is executed after the deletion, potentially leading to unhandled cases where the caller expects a callback to be invoked.

DONE.
