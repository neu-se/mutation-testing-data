 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(accum, curr, index) => accum + curr
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the reduce function to add the current Op to the accumulator instead of using the provided predicate function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(accum, curr, index) => accum - curr
