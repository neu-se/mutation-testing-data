Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
indices[r - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the index used in the `quantileSelect` function call, potentially affecting the sorting and selection of quantiles.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
arr.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the length of the array instead of the index from the `indices` array, which could lead to incorrect sorting and quantile selection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.floor(indices[l] + (indices[r] - indices[l]) / 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates a new index based on the average of the `l` and `r` indices, instead of using the `r` index directly, which could affect the sorting and selection of quantiles.

DONE.
