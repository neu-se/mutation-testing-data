  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.delete === 'string' &&
        typeof lastOp.delete === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if both `newOp.delete` and `lastOp.delete` are numbers, while the new code fragment checks if both are strings. This change would cause the code to behave differently when the `delete` properties are not numbers.

DONE.
