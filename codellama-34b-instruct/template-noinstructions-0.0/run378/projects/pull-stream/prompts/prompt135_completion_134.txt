  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` function would be called instead of the `cb` function, which could cause the stream to error out in a different way.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed to the `cb` function instead of the expected `err` object, which could cause the stream to error out in a different way.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be passed to the `cb` function instead of the expected `err` object, which could cause the stream to error out in a different way.

DONE.
