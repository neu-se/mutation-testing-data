Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criteriae'
```
This would result in different behavior because the plural form of "criterion" is "criteria," but this change incorrectly adds an "e" at the end, resulting in "criteriae," which is not a valid plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterions'
```
This would result in different behavior because "criterions" is not a recognized plural form of "criterion," whereas the correct plural is "criteria." This change would lead to incorrect pluralization.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criteriaz'
```
This would result in different behavior because "criteriaz" is a nonsensical alteration of the correct plural "criteria," introducing an invalid suffix that does not conform to standard English pluralization rules.

DONE.
