  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.warn !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` if `console` is defined, regardless of whether `console.warn` is a function or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof console.warn !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` if `console.warn` is not a function, regardless of whether `console` is defined or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof console !== "undefined" && console.warn !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `true` if `console` is defined and `console.warn` is not a function.

DONE.
