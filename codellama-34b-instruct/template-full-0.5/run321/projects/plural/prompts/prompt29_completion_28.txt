  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/thesis|crisis/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 's' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `substr` to remove the last two characters of the word, while this code fragment removes only the last character. This would cause the plural form of words ending in "thesis" or "crisis" to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/thesis|crisis/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ies' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `substr` to remove the last two characters of the word, while this code fragment removes the last three characters and adds "ies" to the end. This would cause the plural form of words ending in "thesis" or "crisis" to be incorrect.
