  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href + 'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the letter 'a' to the end of the href attribute, which could potentially cause the link to break or behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the href attribute to uppercase, which could potentially cause the link to break or behave differently if the target URL is case-sensitive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.split('/')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the href attribute on the '/' character and return the first part of the URL, which could potentially cause the link to break or behave differently if the target URL is not the first part of the href attribute.

DONE.
