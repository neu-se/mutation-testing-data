  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `arguments` is a special keyword in JavaScript that refers to the arguments passed to a function, while `null` is a primitive value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `arguments` is a special keyword in JavaScript that refers to the arguments passed to a function, while `undefined` is a primitive value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `arguments` is a special keyword in JavaScript that refers to the arguments passed to a function, while `[]` is an empty array.

DONE.
