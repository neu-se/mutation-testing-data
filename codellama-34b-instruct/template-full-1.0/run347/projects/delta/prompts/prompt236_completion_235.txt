  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `next()` is a method that advances the iterator to the next position, whereas `next` is a property that returns the next item in the iterable without advancing the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.nombre_ whebander locked 
```
This would result in different behavior because `nombre_ whebander` and `locked` are not valid method or property names, and would likely cause a syntax error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength()` returns the length of the current op, whereas `next()` returns the op itself.

DONE.
