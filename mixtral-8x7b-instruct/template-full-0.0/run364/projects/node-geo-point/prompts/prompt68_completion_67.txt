 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the result of `atan2` would always be a positive value, which would affect the calculation of the `λ2` variable and result in incorrect longitude values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-x
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the `y` variable would be flipped, which would affect the calculation of the `λ2` variable and result in incorrect longitude values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan2` function would return `0`, which would affect the calculation of the `λ2` variable and result in incorrect longitude values.

DONE.
