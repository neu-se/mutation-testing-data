Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush('invalid_key');
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to flush the queue using a non-existent key, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors when trying to access data associated with 'invalid_key'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` as an argument may cause the `_flush` method to behave incorrectly, potentially leading to a failure in processing the queue or writing data, as it may not handle `null` as a valid input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` could lead to similar issues as passing `null`, where the method may not be able to process the queue correctly, resulting in data not being written or flushed as expected.

DONE.
