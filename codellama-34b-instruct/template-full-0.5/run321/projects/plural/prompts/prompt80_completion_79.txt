  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'geese'`, which is the correct plural form of the word "goose".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'gooses'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'geese'`, which is the correct plural form of the word "goose".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose' + 'es'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'geese'`, which is the correct plural form of the word "goose".

DONE.
