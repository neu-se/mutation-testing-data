  As an expert in mutation testing, I have analyzed the provided code and identified three potential code fragments that could replace the PLACEHOLDER with different behavior.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
threw && deferred.notify(newValue)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only call `deferred.notify(newValue)` if both `threw` and `deferred.notify(newValue)` are truthy. In the original code, `deferred.notify(newValue)` is called regardless of the value of `threw`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
threw || deferred.notify(newValue)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only call `deferred.notify(newValue)` if either `threw` or `deferred.notify(newValue)` are truthy. In the original code, `deferred.notify(newValue)` is called regardless of the value of `threw`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
