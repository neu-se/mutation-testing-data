  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by 1 would always result in the same value, causing the logic to always return 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition would change the value of the expression, potentially causing the logic to go into a different branch of the if statement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction would change the value of the expression, potentially causing the logic to go into a different branch of the if statement.

DONE.
