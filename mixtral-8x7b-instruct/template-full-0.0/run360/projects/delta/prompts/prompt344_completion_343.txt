 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'none' as const
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the 'none' embed type, even when other embed types are present in the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always assume the embed type is 'insert', which may not be the case, and could lead to incorrect handling of other embed types.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Math.random().toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would generate a random string each time, which is unlikely to match any actual embed type, causing the inversion process to fail or produce incorrect results.

DONE.
