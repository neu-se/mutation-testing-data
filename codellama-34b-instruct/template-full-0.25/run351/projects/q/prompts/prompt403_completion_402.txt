  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).thenResolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `thenResolve` is a method that resolves a promise with the given value, whereas `thenReject` is a method that rejects a promise with the given reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then(function() { throw reason; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method that takes a callback function that is called when the promise is resolved, whereas `thenReject` is a method that rejects a promise with the given reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then(function() { return reason; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method that takes a callback function that is called when the promise is resolved, whereas `thenReject` is a method that rejects a promise with the given reason.

DONE.
