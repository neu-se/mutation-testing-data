  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would decrement `i` instead of incrementing it, which would cause the loop to run indefinitely or until an error occurs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip over every other element in the array, which could cause the loop to miss certain elements or to access elements that do not exist.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would reset `i` to 0 every time it runs, which would cause the loop to run indefinitely or until an error occurs.

DONE.
