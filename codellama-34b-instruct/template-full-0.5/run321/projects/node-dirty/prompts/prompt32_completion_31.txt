  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 'x'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the key being set, potentially causing the data to be stored in the wrong location.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the data to be deleted from the database, rather than stored.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'key'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the data to be stored under a different key, potentially causing the data to be unretrievable.

DONE.
