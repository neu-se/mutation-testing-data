 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `exp` method would return a `Complex` object with a `sin` component of 0, regardless of the input's `im` property value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `exp` method would return a `Complex` object with a `sin` component equal to the `exp` of the input's `im` property, instead of the input's `im` property itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `exp` method would return a `Complex` object with a `sin` component equal to the product of the `exp` of the input's `re` property and the `sin` of the input's `im` property.

DONE.
