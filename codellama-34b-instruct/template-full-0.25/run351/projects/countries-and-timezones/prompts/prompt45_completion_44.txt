  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the next ID instead of the current one, which could cause errors in the code that uses the returned ID.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the previous ID instead of the current one, which could cause errors in the code that uses the returned ID.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return twice the ID instead of the current one, which could cause errors in the code that uses the returned ID.

DONE.
