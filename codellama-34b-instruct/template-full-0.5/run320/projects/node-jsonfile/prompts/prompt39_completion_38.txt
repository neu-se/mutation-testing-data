  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFileSync` is a synchronous function that writes data to a file, while `fs.writeFile` is an asynchronous function that writes data to a file asynchronously. Using `fs.writeFileSync` in the `_writeFile` function would make the function synchronous, which could cause performance issues if the function is called repeatedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync(file, str, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFileSync` is a function that takes three arguments: the file to write to, the data to write, and an options object. Using `fs.writeFileSync(file, str, options)` would cause the function to write the data to the file synchronously, which could cause performance issues if the function is called repeatedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFile(file, str,
