  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.then` is a function that returns a promise, while `this.then.bind(this)` is a bound function that returns a promise when called. In the original code, the `this` context is not preserved, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the `this` context is important for the promise chain. By using `bind(this)`, we ensure that the `this` context is preserved, which may be important for the correct execution of the promise chain.

DONE.
