  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort = true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` variable would be set to `true`, causing the `read` function to be called with `true` as the first argument, which would cause the stream to be aborted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort = false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` variable would be set to `false`, causing the `read` function to be called with `false` as the first argument, which would cause the stream to continue reading data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` variable would be set to `null`, causing the `read` function to be called with `null` as the first argument, which would cause the stream to continue reading data.

DONE.
