  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next().type
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method advances the iterator, which could lead to a mismatch between the iterators and the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek().type
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek()` method returns the next value in the sequence without advancing the iterator, which could lead to a mismatch between the iterators and the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek().type
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek()` method returns the next value in the sequence without advancing the iterator, which could lead to a mismatch between the iterators and the original code.

DONE.
