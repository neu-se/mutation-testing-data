  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer` creates a deferred object, which is a placeholder for a value that is not yet known. On the other hand, `Q.reject` rejects a promise and signals that an error has occurred.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` resolves a promise and signals that the operation has completed successfully.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer().reject` creates a deferred object and then rejects it, which indicates that the operation has failed.

DONE.
