  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mouses'
```
This would result in different behavior because the correct plural form of "mouse" is "mice", not "mouses".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mice' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator is not used correctly in this context, and would result in the string "mices" instead of "mice".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mice'.replace('ice', 'ouses')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method is not used correctly in this context, and would result in the string "mouses" instead of "mice".

DONE.
