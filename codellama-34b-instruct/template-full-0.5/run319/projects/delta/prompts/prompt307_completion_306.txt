  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.push(iter.next());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the next op into the line, rather than the current op.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.push(thisOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the current op into the line, rather than the next op.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.push(otherIter.next());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the next op from the other delta into the line, rather than the current op.

DONE.
