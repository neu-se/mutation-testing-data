Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would indicate that one record was loaded instead of zero, potentially misleading the caller about the state of the database.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `null` instead of `0` could cause type-related issues in the code that expects a number, leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.size + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly suggest that one additional record was loaded, which could lead to inconsistencies in the application's understanding of the database state.

DONE.
