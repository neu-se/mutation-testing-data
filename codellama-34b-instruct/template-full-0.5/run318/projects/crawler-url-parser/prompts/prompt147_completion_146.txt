  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.split("/")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `split` method to split the `linkurl_path` string into an array of substrings using `/` as the separator. However, if we replace the `split` method with `split("/")`, the code will attempt to call the `split` method with the string `"/"` as an argument, which is not a valid method call. This will result in a syntax error and different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.split(/\//)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `split` method to split the `linkurl_path` string into an array of substrings using `/` as the separator. However, if we replace the `split` method with `split(/\//)`, the code will attempt to call the `split` method with the regular expression `/\//` as an argument, which will not match any substrings in the `link
