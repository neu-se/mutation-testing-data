  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
min + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `min` variable is used to calculate the offset string, and adding 1 to it would change the resulting string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
min * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `min` variable is used to calculate the offset string, and multiplying it by 2 would change the resulting string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
min - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `min` variable is used to calculate the offset string, and subtracting 1 from it would change the resulting string.

DONE.
