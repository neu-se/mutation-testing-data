  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, data
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`, and it would cause the `map` function to receive a different argument than what it was designed to handle.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `map` function to receive two `null` arguments, which would likely result in an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, data
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `map` function to receive the same argument twice, which would likely result in an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
