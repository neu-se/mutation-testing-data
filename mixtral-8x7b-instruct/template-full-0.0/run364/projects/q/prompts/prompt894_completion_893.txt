 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `[].slice` is the standard way to get the slice function in modern JavaScript, while `array_slice` is an implementation-specific name that may not be present in all environments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.prototype.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype.slice` is the standard way to get the slice function in modern JavaScript, but it is a method of the Array prototype, not a global function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` is a completely different function that rounds a number down to the nearest integer. It has nothing to do with arrays or slicing arrays.

DONE.
