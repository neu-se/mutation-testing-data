  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args[0]]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass only the first element of the `args` array as an argument to the `dispatch` method, whereas the original code fragment passes the entire `args` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args.slice(1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass only the second and subsequent elements of the `args` array as arguments to the `dispatch` method, whereas the original code fragment passes the entire `args` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args.slice(0, -1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass only the first and second elements of the `args` array as arguments to the `dispatch` method, whereas the original code fragment passes the entire `args` array.

DONE.
