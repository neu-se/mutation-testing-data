  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.map((op) => op.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of numbers, representing the lengths of each operation in the delta, rather than an array of operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.map((op) => op.insert)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of strings, representing the inserted text for each operation in the delta, rather than an array of operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.map((op) => op.retain)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of numbers, representing the retained length for each operation in the delta, rather than an array of operations.

DONE.
