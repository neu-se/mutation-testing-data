  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because `linkurl.path` is a string, while `linkurl` is an object with properties such as `url`, `text`, `type`, and `baseurl`. Using `linkurl.path` would cause the `gettype` function to receive a string instead of an object, which could lead to unexpected results.

DONE.
