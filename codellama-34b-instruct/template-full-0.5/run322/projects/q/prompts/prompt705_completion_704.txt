  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args
```
This would result in different behavior because `args` is a local variable that is not defined in the context of the `Promise.prototype.fbind` method, whereas `arguments` is a built-in object that is available in all functions. Using `args` instead of `arguments` would cause a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.arguments` is a reference to the `arguments` object of the `Promise.prototype.fbind` method, which is not the same as the `arguments` object of the function that is being bound. Using `this.arguments` instead of `arguments` would cause the bound function to receive the wrong arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an array-like object, and therefore does not have a `length` property. Using `null` instead of `
