 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a division by zero error when the divisor (z.im) is zero, while the original code would return Complex['INFINITY'] in that case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return false, while the original code checks if the other operand is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
isFinite(z['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the value is finite, rather than checking if it is infinite. This would cause the multiplication to always return a valid complex number, even when one of the operands is infinite.

DONE.
