  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a syntax error due to the missing parentheses.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a runtime error due to the missing function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect(rejected)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a runtime error due to the unhandled rejection.

DONE.
