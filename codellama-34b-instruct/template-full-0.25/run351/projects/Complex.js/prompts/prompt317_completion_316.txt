  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because `cosh` is the hyperbolic cosine function, which is different from the `sinh` function that was originally used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tanh
```
This would result in different behavior because `tanh` is the hyperbolic tangent function, which is different from the `sinh` function that was originally used.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin` is the sine function, which is different from the `sinh` function that was originally used.

DONE.
