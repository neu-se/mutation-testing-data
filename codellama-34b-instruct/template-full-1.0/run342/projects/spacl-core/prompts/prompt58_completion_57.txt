  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'$0'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string would be consecutive, whereas the original string is non-consecutive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'$42'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string would have a different numerical value than the original string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement character is not a valid character in the syntax of the template language.

DONE.
