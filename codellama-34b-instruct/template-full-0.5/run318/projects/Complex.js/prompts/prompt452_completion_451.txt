  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` returns the sine of a number, while `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.max` returns the largest of two numbers, while `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random` returns a random number between 0 and 1, while `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number.

DONE.
