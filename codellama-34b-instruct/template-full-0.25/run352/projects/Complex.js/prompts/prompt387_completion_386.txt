  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinh` function is not the same as the `cosh` function, and would produce a different result for the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tanh
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tanh` function is not the same as the `cosh` function, and would produce a different result for the same input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coth
```
This would result in different behavior because the `coth` function is not the same as the `cosh` function, and would produce a different result for the same input.

DONE.
