  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, null, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, setting the value to `undefined` would delete the key from the map, but setting it to `null` would set the key to `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, false, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, setting the value to `undefined` would delete the key from the map, but setting it to `false` would set the key to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, 0, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, setting the value to `undefined` would delete the key from the map, but setting it to `0` would set the key to `0`.

DONE.
