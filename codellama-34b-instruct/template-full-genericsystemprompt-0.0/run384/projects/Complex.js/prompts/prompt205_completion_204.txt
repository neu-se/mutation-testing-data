  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the imaginary part of the complex number instead of the real part, which would cause the calculation to produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the real part of the complex number, which would cause the calculation to produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the real part of the complex number, which would cause the calculation to produce a different result.

DONE.
