  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not an object, and so `dispatch` method would not be called, and the promise would not be resolved with the expected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is an object, but it does not have a `dispatch` method, and so the promise would be rejected with a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the global object, which does not have a `dispatch` method, and so the promise would be rejected with a `TypeError`.

DONE.
