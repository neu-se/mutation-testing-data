  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick()
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` is a function that schedules a task to be executed in the next tick of the event loop, but `requestTick()` would immediately execute the task instead of scheduling it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick.bind(null)` would create a new function that is bound to the `null` context, but it would not execute the task.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick.call(null)` would execute the task immediately, but it would not schedule it to be executed in the next tick of the event loop.

DONE.
