  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[result, match]
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting array would have the elements in reverse order, which could potentially cause issues if the code assumes a specific order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[match, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting array would have a null value as the second element, which could potentially cause issues if the code assumes a specific value or type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[match, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting array would have an undefined value as the second element, which could potentially cause issues if the code assumes a specific value or type.

DONE.
