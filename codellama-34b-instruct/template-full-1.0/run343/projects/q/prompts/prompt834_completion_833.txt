  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because 'null' is a primitive value, and it will not pass the condition check in the 'then' method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty function will always return undefined, and it will not pass the condition check in the 'then' method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
async () => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the code inside the async function will not be executed synchronously, and it may not pass the condition check in the 'then' method.

DONE.
