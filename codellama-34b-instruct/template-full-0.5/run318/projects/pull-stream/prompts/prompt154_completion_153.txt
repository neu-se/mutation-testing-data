  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `onAbort` is a function reference, but `onAbort()` is a function call, which would execute the function immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `onAbort` is a function reference, but `null` is a null value, which would cause a different branch of the `if` statement to be taken.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `onAbort` is a function reference, but `undefined` is a value that is not a function, which would cause a different branch of the `if` statement to be taken.

DONE.
