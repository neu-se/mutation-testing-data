  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.delete !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `nextOp.delete` is a number, while this new code fragment checks if it is not a number. This could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when it should have evaluated to `false`, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.delete === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `nextOp.delete` is a number, while this new code fragment checks if it is a string. This could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` when it should have evaluated to `true`, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.delete === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `nextOp.delete` is a number, while this new code fragment
