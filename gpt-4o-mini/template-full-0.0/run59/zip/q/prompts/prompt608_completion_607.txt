Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of the original `args` would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to receive `null` as its argument, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or errors when trying to access properties or methods on `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` instead of `args` would mean that the `promiseDispatch` method would not receive any arguments, which could lead to it failing to execute correctly or throwing an error due to missing parameters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because passing an empty array instead of the original `args` would change the context of the method call, potentially leading to different execution paths or results, especially if the method being dispatched expects certain arguments to be present.

DONE.
