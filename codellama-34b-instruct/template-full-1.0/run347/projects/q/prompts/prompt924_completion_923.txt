  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `nodeArgs`, which is an array of arguments passed to the `Q.denodeify` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value than `nodeArgs`, which is an array of arguments passed to the `Q.denodeify` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[42]
```
This would result in different behavior because `[42]` is a different value than `nodeArgs`, which is an array of arguments passed to the `Q.denodeify` function.

DONE.
