  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb && function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a logical OR operator to provide a default value for the `cb` parameter, while the new code fragment uses a logical AND operator. This would cause the `function () {}` to be executed unconditionally, regardless of the value of `cb`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb || function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a logical OR operator to provide a default value for the `cb` parameter, while the new code fragment uses a logical NOT operator to invert the value of `cb`. This would cause the `function () {}` to be executed if `cb` is false, rather than if it is true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb ? function () {} : function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a ternary operator to provide a default value for the `cb`
