  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice method would start at the second argument instead of the first, which could cause the method to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 0)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice method would start at the first argument instead of the second, which could cause the method to return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 3)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice method would start at the third argument instead of the second, which could cause the method to return incorrect results.

DONE.
