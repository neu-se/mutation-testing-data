Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
path.join(currentPath, targetPath)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly concatenate the `currentPath` and `targetPath` using `path.join`, instead of replacing `currentPath` with `targetPath` in the `file.name` string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
source.replace(currentPath, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the `currentPath` from the `source` string, instead of replacing it with `targetPath`, potentially leading to incorrect file paths.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
file.name
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not replace `currentPath` with `targetPath` at all, causing the `target` variable to be the same as the `file.name`, potentially leading to overwriting of the original files.

DONE.
