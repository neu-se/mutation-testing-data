  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { throw new Error("test"); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected, which would trigger the `untrackRejection` function and remove the promise from the `unhandledRejections` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return Q.reject("test"); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected, which would trigger the `untrackRejection` function and remove the promise from the `unhandledRejections` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return Q.fulfill("test"); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the value "test", which would trigger the `untrackRejection` function and remove the promise from the `unhandledRejections` array.
