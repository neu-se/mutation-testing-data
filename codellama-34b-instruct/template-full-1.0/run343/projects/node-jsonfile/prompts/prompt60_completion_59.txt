  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Buffer.isEncoding(content)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Buffer.isEncoding()` checks if the provided value is a valid encoding, whereas `Buffer.isBuffer()` checks if the provided value is a buffer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Buffer.isBuffer(content) && content.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the buffer is empty in addition to checking if it's a buffer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Buffer.isBuffer(content)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the check, so it would execute the code inside the if block only if `content` is not a buffer.

DONE.
