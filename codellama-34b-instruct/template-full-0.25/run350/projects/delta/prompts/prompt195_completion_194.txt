  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `isEqual` function, causing the `if` statement to execute the opposite branch of the conditional.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNotEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNotEqual` function is not defined in the code snippet, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isEqualTo
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isEqualTo` function is not defined in the code snippet, and would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
