Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use 0 as the length for the `peekLength()` method, potentially causing the `EQUAL` case to process fewer operations than intended, leading to incorrect diffs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly increase the length by 1, causing the loop to process one extra operation than it should, which could lead to unexpected results in the diffing process.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrease the length by 1, potentially skipping the last operation in the iteration, which could lead to incomplete or incorrect diffs being generated.

DONE.
