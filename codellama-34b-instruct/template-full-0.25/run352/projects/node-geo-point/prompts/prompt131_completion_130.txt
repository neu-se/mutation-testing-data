  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile` method would be called with a different zoom level, which could affect the calculation of the tile coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile` method would be called with a zoom level that is twice the original value, which could affect the calculation of the tile coordinates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile` method would be called with a zoom level that is one level lower than the original value, which could affect the calculation of the tile coordinates.

DONE.
