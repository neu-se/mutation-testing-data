  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `ops.length` would always be truthy, even if `ops` is not an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray(ops)
```
This would result in different behavior because `!Array.isArray(ops)` would be falsy if `ops` is an array, but the original code fragment would evaluate to truthy in that case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ops === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof ops === 'object'` would be truthy if `ops` is not an array, but the original code fragment would only be truthy if `ops` is an array.

DONE.
