  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && true, done && function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` variable is now being referenced as a boolean value, rather than an erroneous value. Similarly, the `done` function is now being referred to as a boolean value, rather than a function that can be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === true, done === function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` variable is now being compared directly to the boolean value `true`, rather than being referenced as a boolean value. Similarly, the `done` function is now being compared directly to an empty function, rather than being referenced as a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort or true, done or function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` variable is now being used as the left operand of the `or` operator, rather than being referenced as a boolean value
