 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates an empty object instead of cloning the `newOp`. This could lead to unexpected results in the rest of the `push` method, as it assumes `newOp` has the correct properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the new operation to `null`. This would cause an error in the following line, `if (typeof lastOp === 'object')`, since `null` is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
lastOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it reuses the `lastOp` instead of creating a new one. This could lead to unexpected results in the rest of the `push` method, as it assumes `newOp` has the correct properties.

DONE.
