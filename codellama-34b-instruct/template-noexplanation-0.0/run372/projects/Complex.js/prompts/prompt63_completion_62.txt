  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This change will cause the `parse` function to return a different value for the `z` object, which will in turn affect the behavior of the `Complex` constructor.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This change will cause the `parse` function to return a different value for the `z` object, which will in turn affect the behavior of the `Complex` constructor.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos
```
This change will cause the `parse` function to return a different value for the `z` object, which will in turn affect the behavior of the `Complex` constructor.

DONE.
