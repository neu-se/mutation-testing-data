  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeStackTraceLong
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeStackTraceLong` function is not defined in the original code, and therefore would cause an error when called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("Hello, world!")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `console.log` function is not defined in the original code, and therefore would cause an error when called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nextTick(function () {
    throw new Error("Test error");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.nextTick` function is not defined in the original code, and therefore would cause an error when called.

DONE.
