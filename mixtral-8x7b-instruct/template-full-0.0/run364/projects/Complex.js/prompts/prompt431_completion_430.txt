 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / this['re'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the sign of the real part when the original number is negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(this['re']) * places
```
This would result in different behavior because it always makes the real part positive, even when the original number is negative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re'] * (places - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it reduces the value of the real part by a factor of 10 for each place.

DONE.
