  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method returns a new string, while the original code fragment returns the original string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method returns an array of substrings, while the original code fragment returns a single string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.replace(/^/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method returns a new string with the first character removed, while the original code fragment returns the original string.

DONE.
