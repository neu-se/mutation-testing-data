  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, onUnhandledError
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not the same as `void 0`, and would cause the `onUnhandledError` function to be called with `null` as an argument instead of `void 0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, onUnhandledError
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `void 0`, and would cause the `onUnhandledError` function to be called with `undefined` as an argument instead of `void 0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function would be called without any arguments instead of being called with `void 0` as an argument.

DONE.
