  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(c) => getCountry(c, { deprecated: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different set of countries, as the `deprecated` option would return only deprecated countries.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(c) => getCountry(c, { allTimezones: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different set of countries, as the `allTimezones` option would return all timezones for each country, regardless of whether they are deprecated or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(c) => getTimezone(c)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different set of timezones, as it would return all timezones for each country, regardless of whether they are deprecated or not.

DONE.
