  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb === null
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if `cb` is `null`, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc === null
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if `acc` is `null`, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink === null
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if `sink` is `null`, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

DONE.
