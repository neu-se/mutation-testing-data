  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `sin` to calculate the bearing, while replacing it with `cos` would produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acos
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `acos` to calculate the distance, while replacing it with `cos` would produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `rad2deg` to convert the bearing from radians to degrees, while replacing it with `deg2rad` would produce a different result.

DONE.
