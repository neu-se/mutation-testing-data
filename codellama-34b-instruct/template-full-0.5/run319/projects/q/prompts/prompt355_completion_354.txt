  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, while `newException` is an instance of an Error object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw exception
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is a statement that raises an exception, while `reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a function that returns a resolved promise, while `reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise.

DONE.
