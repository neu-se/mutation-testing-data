  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(dispatch)
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method that takes a callback function as an argument, and the callback function is called with the resolved value of the promise. In this case, the callback function is `dispatch`, which is a method that dispatches a message to a value in a future turn.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).catch(dispatch)
```
This would result in different behavior because `catch` is a method that takes a callback function as an argument, and the callback function is called with the rejected value of the promise. In this case, the callback function is `dispatch`, which is a method that dispatches a message to a value in a future turn.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).finally(dispatch)
```
This would result in different behavior because `finally` is a method that takes a callback function as an argument, and the callback function is called
