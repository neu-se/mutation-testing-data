  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the expression `this['isInfinite']`, so it will return `true` when the number is not infinite, and `false` when it is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the number is zero, which is the opposite of checking if it is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(this['re'] && this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if both the real and imaginary parts are zero, which is the opposite of checking if the number is infinite.

DONE.
