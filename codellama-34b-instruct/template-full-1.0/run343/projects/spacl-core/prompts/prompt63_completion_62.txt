  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 1, which is not a valid regular expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[/]/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any character, including slashes, instead of matching only non-slash characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/.+/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any character, including slashes, instead of matching only non-slash characters. It also adds a `+` operator, which would change the number of matches returned.

DONE.
