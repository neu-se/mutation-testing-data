  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the `targetBasePath` string to uppercase, which could cause the `access()` method to fail if the path is case-sensitive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property would return the length of the `targetBasePath` string, which could cause the `access()` method to fail if the path is not the correct length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.split('/')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method would split the `targetBasePath` string into an array of substrings using the `/` character as a delimiter, and then return the first element of the array. This could cause the `access()` method to fail if the path is not in the correct format.
