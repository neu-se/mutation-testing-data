  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result, { [country]: { current: [], all: [] } }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Object.assign` method is used to merge the `current` and `all` arrays, whereas the original code uses the spread operator (`...`) to concatenate the arrays. This could result in different behavior if the `current` and `all` arrays contain duplicate values.
