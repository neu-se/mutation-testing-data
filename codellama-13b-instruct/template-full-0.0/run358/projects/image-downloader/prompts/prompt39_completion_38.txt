  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function would be called with a `null` value, which would cause the promise to be resolved with a `null` value instead of the expected `filename` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve({ filename: 'wrong_dest' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function would be called with a different `filename` object than the expected one, which would cause the promise to be resolved with a different value than the expected one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve({ filename: dest })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function would be called with the same `filename` object as the expected one, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the same value as the expected one. However, this would not be a useful mutation as it would not cause any errors or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
