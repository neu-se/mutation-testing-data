  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments` is a special function object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function, and `arguments.callee.length` is the number of arguments passed to the function. By using `arguments, 2`, we are referencing the second argument passed to the function, which may not be the same as the number of arguments passed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments[1]` refers to the second argument passed to the function, while `arguments.callee.length` refers to the number of arguments passed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.length` refers to the number of elements in the `args` array, while `arguments.callee.length` refers to the number of arguments passed to the function.

DONE.
