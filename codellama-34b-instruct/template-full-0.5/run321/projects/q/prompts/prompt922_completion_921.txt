  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method is used to reject the promise with a reason, while the `resolve` method is used to resolve the promise with a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method is used to reject the promise with a reason, while `null` is a valid value that can be resolved with.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method is used to reject the promise with a reason, while the `notify` method is used to notify the promise with a progress update.

DONE.
