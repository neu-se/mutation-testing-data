  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` method would return `null` instead of a `Delta` object, which would cause the `transformPosition` method to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` method would return a `Delta` object with a length of 0, which would cause the `transformPosition` method to return 0 instead of the correct position.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.attributes.size
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` method would return a `Delta` object with a size that is different from the original size, which would cause the `transformPosition` method to return a different position.

DONE.
