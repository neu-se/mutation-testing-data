  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
illnesses.concat(["new illness"])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only includes the `illnesses` array, while this new code fragment includes an additional element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
illnesses.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment includes all elements of the `illnesses` array, while this new code fragment only includes all but the last element of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
illnesses.filter(function(illness) { return illness !== "rabie" })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment includes the "rabie" illness, while this new code fragment excludes it.

DONE.
