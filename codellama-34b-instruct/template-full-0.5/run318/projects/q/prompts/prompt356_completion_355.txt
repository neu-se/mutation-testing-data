  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw exception
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a rejected promise, while this replacement throws an exception, which would cause the promise to be rejected with an unhandled rejection error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(new Error("Rejected"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a rejected promise with a specific reason, while this replacement returns a rejected promise with a generic reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return resolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a rejected promise, while this replacement returns a resolved promise with the same value.

DONE.
