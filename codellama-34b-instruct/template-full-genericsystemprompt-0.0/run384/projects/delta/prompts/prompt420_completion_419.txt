  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.max` returns the largest of two numbers, while `Math.min` returns the smallest.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the length of the current operation from the index, rather than adding it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset - length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the length of the current operation from the offset, rather than adding it.

DONE.
