  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].exec(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test()` method is used to test for a match, while the `exec()` method is used to extract the matched substring.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].match(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match()` method is used to test for a match, while the `test()` method is used to test for a match and extract the matched substring.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].search(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `search()` method is used to search for a match, while the `test()` method is used to test for a match and extract the matched substring.

DONE.
