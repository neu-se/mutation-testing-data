 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the AttributeMap.invert() method would receive null as the second argument instead of an object, which could cause an error or unexpected behavior in the invert() method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the AttributeMap.invert() method would receive an empty object as the second argument instead of the actual attributes of the baseOp, which could cause the inverted attributes to be incorrect or missing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the AttributeMap.invert() method would receive the attributes of the current operation (thisOp) instead of the attributes of the base operation (baseOp), which could cause the inverted attributes to be incorrect or inconsistent with the original attributes.

DONE.
