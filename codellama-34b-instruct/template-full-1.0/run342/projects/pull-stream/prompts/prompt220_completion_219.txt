  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`, and could cause the function to behave unexpectedly when passed as an argument to other functions that may be expecting a null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is not the same as `null`, and could cause the function to behave unexpectedly when passed as an argument to other functions that may be expecting a null value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object, and could cause the function to behave unexpectedly when passed as an argument to other functions that may be expecting a null value.

DONE.
