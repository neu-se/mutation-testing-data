 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb.toString()` returns a string representation of the `cb` function, rather than invoking the function as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / cb
```
This would result in different behavior because if `cb` is not a number, attempting to divide by it would result in a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs()` returns the absolute value of a number, so if `cb` is a function or any non-numeric value, it would result in `NaN`.

These mutations would likely cause the tests to fail, indicating that the tests are effectively catching potential issues in the code. DONE.
