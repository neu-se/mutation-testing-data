  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'r' in a && 'phi' in b
```
This change will cause the code to always return `Complex['INFINITY']`, regardless of the input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'r' in b && 'phi' in a
```
This change will cause the code to always return `Complex['INFINITY']`, regardless of the input values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'r' in a && 'phi' in a
```
This change will cause the code to always return `Complex['INFINITY']`, regardless of the input values.

DONE.
