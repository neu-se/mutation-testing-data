  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the truthiness of the `cb` variable, which would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if the `cb` function is defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator will only evaluate the second operand if the first operand is truthy. Since `cb` is a function, it will always be truthy, so the `false` value will always be returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator will only evaluate the second operand if the first operand is falsy. Since `cb` is a function, it will always be truthy, so the `true` value will never be returned.

DONE.
