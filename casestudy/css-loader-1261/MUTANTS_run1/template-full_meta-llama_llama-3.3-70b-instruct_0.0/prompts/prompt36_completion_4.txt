Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
encodeURI
```
This would result in different behavior because `encodeURI` is used to encode a URI, whereas `unescape` is used to decode a URI, so using `encodeURI` instead of `unescape` would change the direction of the URI transformation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
normalizedUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of decoding the `normalizedUrl`, it would simply return the `normalizedUrl` as is, without any decoding, which could lead to different results if the URL contains special characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
escape
```
This would result in different behavior because `escape` is a deprecated function that encodes a string, whereas `unescape` decodes a string, so using `escape` instead of `unescape` would not only change the direction of the transformation but also use a deprecated function, which could lead to compatibility issues.

DONE.
