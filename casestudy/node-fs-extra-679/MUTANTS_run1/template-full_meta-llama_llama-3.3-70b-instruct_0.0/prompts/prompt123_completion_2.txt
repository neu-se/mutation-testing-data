Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
path.parse(src).root
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the comparison to check if the destination parent is the root path of the source, rather than the destination, potentially allowing incorrect paths to pass the check.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
src
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the comparison to check if the destination parent is the same as the source, rather than the root path of the destination, potentially causing incorrect paths to be incorrectly identified as subdirectories.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
path.parse(dest).dir
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the comparison to check if the destination parent is the directory name of the destination, rather than the root path of the destination, potentially allowing incorrect paths to pass the check.

DONE.
