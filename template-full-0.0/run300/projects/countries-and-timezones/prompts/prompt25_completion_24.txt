  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(dstOffset)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getOffsetStr` function with the `dstOffset` variable, which is not the same as the `offset` variable that is passed to the function in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(utcOffset)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getOffsetStr` function with the `utcOffset` variable, which is not the same as the `offset` variable that is passed to the function in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(dstOffset + utcOffset)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getOffsetStr` function with the sum of the `dstOffset` and `utcOffset` variables, which is not the same as the `offset` variable that is passed to the function in the original code.

DONE.
