  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(index = 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute, as the condition `index > 0` would always be false when `index` is initialized to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(index = -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute once, as the condition `index > 0` would be true when `index` is initialized to -1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(index = Math.floor(Math.random() * line.length))
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute at most once, as the condition `index > 0` would be true when `index` is initialized to a random integer between 0 and the length of the line.

DONE.
