Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbed
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to terminate when `cbed` is true, which means that the callback has been executed, potentially leading to premature termination of the reading process.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue as long as `abort` is false, which could lead to an infinite loop if `abort` is never set to true, preventing the reading process from completing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would terminate the loop when the `data` received is `null`, which may not be the intended condition for stopping the reading process, potentially skipping valid data.

DONE.
