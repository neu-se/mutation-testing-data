  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' && otherIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if both iterators are on an insert operation, regardless of the priority flag.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' && otherIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if the first iterator is on an insert operation and the second iterator is on a delete operation, regardless of the priority flag.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'delete' && otherIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if the first iterator is on a delete operation and the second iterator is on an insert operation, regardless of the priority flag.

DONE.
