  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(promise).tap` is a method that returns a promise that is resolved with the original promise, while `Q(promise).then` is a method that returns a promise that is resolved with the result of the callback function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then(function() { return promise; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(promise).tap` is a method that returns a promise that is resolved with the original promise, while `Q(promise).then(function() { return promise; })` is a method that returns a promise that is resolved with the result of the callback function, which is the original promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then(function() { return Q(promise); })
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(promise).tap
