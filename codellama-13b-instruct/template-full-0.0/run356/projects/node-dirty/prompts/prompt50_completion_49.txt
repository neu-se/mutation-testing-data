  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment retrieves the value stored at a key in the database, while the buggy code fragment would retrieve the value stored at a key in the database and then return the value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(key).val
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment retrieves the value stored at a key in the database, while the buggy code fragment would retrieve the value stored at a key in the database and then return the value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(key).val.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment retrieves the value stored at a key in the database, while the buggy code fragment would retrieve the value stored at a key in the database and then return the value as a string.

DONE.
