  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` and `push` are two different methods of the `Delta` class, and they have different effects on the delta's internal state. While `push` adds an operation to the end of the delta, `insert` inserts an operation at a specific position in the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` and `push` are two different methods of the `Delta` class, and they have different effects on the delta's internal state. While `push` adds an operation to the end of the delta, `retain` adds an operation that retains the current position in the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` and `push` are two different methods of the `Delta` class, and they have different effects on the
