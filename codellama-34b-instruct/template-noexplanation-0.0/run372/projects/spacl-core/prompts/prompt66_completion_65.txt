  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule = this.rules[0];
```
This change will cause the loop to only iterate over the first rule in the `rules` array, rather than all of them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule = this.rules[this.rules.length - 1];
```
This change will cause the loop to only iterate over the last rule in the `rules` array, rather than all of them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule = this.rules[Math.floor(Math.random() * this.rules.length)];
```
This change will cause the loop to iterate over a random rule in the `rules` array, rather than all of them.

DONE.
