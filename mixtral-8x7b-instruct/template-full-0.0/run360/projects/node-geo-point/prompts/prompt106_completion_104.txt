 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(Math.log(2) * zoom)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates 2 to the power of zoom using a different formula, which may not provide the correct tile coordinates for the given longitude and latitude.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
2 ** zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates 2 to the power of zoom using a different operator, which may not provide the correct tile coordinates for the given longitude and latitude.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 << zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates 2 to the power of zoom using a bitwise operator, which may not provide the correct tile coordinates for the given longitude and latitude.

DONE.
