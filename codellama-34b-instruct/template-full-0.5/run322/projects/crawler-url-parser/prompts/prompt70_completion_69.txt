  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cheerio.parse
```
This would result in different behavior because `cheerio.parse` is a function that parses HTML, while `cheerio.load` is a function that loads HTML into a Cheerio object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cheerio.root()
```
This would result in different behavior because `cheerio.root()` returns the root element of a Cheerio object, while `cheerio.load` loads HTML into a Cheerio object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cheerio.text()
```
This would result in different behavior because `cheerio.text()` returns the text content of a Cheerio object, while `cheerio.load` loads HTML into a Cheerio object.

DONE.
