  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(i++)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the value of `i` and then call the `cb` function with the new value of `i`, whereas the original code would call the `cb` function with the original value of `i` and then increment it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(i + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with the value of `i` plus one, whereas the original code would call the `cb` function with the original value of `i`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i++)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with the value of `null` and then increment the value of `i`, whereas the original code would call the `cb` function with the original value of `i` and then increment it.

DONE.
