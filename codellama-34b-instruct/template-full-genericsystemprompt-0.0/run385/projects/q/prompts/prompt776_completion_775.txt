  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(result) {
    return result + 1;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is not called on the original promise, but on the result of the original promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(result) {
    return result * 2;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is not called on the original promise, but on the result of the original promise, and the callback function returns a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(result) {
    return result + Math.random();
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is not called on the original promise, but on the result of the original promise, and the callback function returns a different value that is not deterministic.

DONE.
