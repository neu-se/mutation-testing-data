  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `diff()` function would be called with `null` as the first argument, which would likely throw an error or produce unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `diff()` function would be called with the second string in the `strings` array as the first argument, which would likely produce a different result from the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0].length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `diff()` function would be called with the length of the first string in the `strings` array as the first argument, which would likely produce a different result from the original code fragment.

DONE.
