This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would produce plural nouns by removing the last two characters of the word and adding "es," whereas this new code fragment would produce plural nouns by simply adding "es" to the end of the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'es' }

This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would produce plural nouns by removing the last two characters of the word and adding "es," whereas this new code fragment would produce plural nouns by removing the last character of the word and adding "es."

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace(/s$/, 'es') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would produce plural
