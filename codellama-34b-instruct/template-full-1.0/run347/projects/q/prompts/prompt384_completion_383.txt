  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```w
callback.fcall(value).thenResolve(5)
```
This would result in different behavior because it hardcodes the value `5` instead of using the `value` passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```csharp
callback.fcall(value).thenResolve(value + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds `1` to the `value` passed to the function instead of using the `value` directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```csharp
callback.fcall(value).thenResolve(callback(value))
```
This would result in different behavior because it applies the `callback` function to the `value` before passing it to `thenResolve`, which could result in a different resolved value depending on the implementation of `callback`.

DONE.
