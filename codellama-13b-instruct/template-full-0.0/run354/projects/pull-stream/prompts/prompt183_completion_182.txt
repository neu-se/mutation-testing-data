  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would always be true, causing the callback to be called with the next value in the array, rather than checking if the index is greater than or equal to the length of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would always be false, causing the callback to be called with the next value in the array, rather than checking if the index is greater than or equal to the length of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i === array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would always be false, causing the callback to be called with the next value in the array, rather than checking if the index is greater than or equal to the length of the array.

DONE.
