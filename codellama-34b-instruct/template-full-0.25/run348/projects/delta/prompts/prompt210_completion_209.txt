  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first operation in the `ops` array, which could cause the `concat` method to produce an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last operation in the `ops` array, which could cause the `concat` method to produce an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only include the first operation in the `ops` array, which could cause the `concat` method to produce an incorrect result.

DONE.
