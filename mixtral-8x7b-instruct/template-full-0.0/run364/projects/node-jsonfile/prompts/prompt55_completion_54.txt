 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the JSON.stringify() function would throw an error when trying to process the undefined value, while the original code fragment would correctly handle it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the JSON.stringify() function would output "null" for the value, while the original code fragment would output an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{a: 1}
```
This would result in different behavior because the JSON.stringify() function would include the object in the output, while the original code fragment would ignore it.

DONE.
