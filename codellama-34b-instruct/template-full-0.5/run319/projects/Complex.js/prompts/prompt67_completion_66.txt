  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.length > 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow for arrays with more than two elements to be parsed as complex numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.length < 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow for arrays with fewer than two elements to be parsed as complex numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.length === 3
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow for arrays with three elements to be parsed as complex numbers.

DONE.
