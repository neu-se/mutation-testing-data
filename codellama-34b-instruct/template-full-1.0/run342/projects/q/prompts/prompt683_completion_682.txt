  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment, `object`, would evaluate to the object itself, whereas `undefined` would evaluate to the value `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment, `object`, would evaluate to the object itself, whereas `null` would evaluate to the value `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment, `object`, would evaluate to the object itself, whereas `{}` would evaluate to an empty object.

Here are three possible buggy code fragments that could be used to replace the PLACEHOLDER:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment, `object`, would evaluate to the object itself, whereas `42` would evaluate to
