  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
\r\n
```
This would result in different behavior because \r is the carriage return character and \n is the line feed character. 

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
\r
```
This would result in different behavior because \r stands for "return" which causes the cursor to return to the start of the current line, instead of "newline" which causes the cursor to move to the next line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
\n\r
```
This would result in different behavior because \n\r stays in the same line instead of moving to the next line.

DONE.
