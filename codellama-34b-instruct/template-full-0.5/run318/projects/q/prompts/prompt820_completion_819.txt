  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, fulfilled, progress
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments has been reversed, causing the fulfillment and rejection handlers to be swapped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the rejection and progress handlers are not provided, so any rejection or progress notifications will be ignored.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, progress
```
This would result in different behavior because the fulfillment handler is not provided, so any fulfillment notifications will be ignored.

DONE.
