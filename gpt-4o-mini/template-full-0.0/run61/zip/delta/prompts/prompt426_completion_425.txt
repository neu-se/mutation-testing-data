Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `op.delete` is `null`, which would incorrectly allow the function to return `null` instead of the expected number, potentially leading to unexpected results when `op.delete` is actually a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.delete === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `op.delete` is a string, which would cause the function to skip the `delete` case entirely, leading to incorrect length calculations when `op.delete` is a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `op.retain` is `undefined`, which would bypass the check for `op.delete` and potentially lead to incorrect length calculations when `op.delete` is a valid number.

DONE.
