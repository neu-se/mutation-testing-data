  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons[at + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the next element in the `unhandledReasons` array instead of the current element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons[at - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the previous element in the `unhandledReasons` array instead of the current element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons[at + 10]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access an element 10 positions after the current element in the `unhandledReasons` array.

DONE.
