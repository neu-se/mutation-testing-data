  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestPortTick()
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestPortTick()` is not the same as `requestPortTick`. By adding the parentheses, we are actually calling the function instead of just referring to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + requestPortTick
```
This would result in different behavior because `1 + requestPortTick` is a mathematical expression that will be evaluated to a different value than `requestPortTick`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestPortTick + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestPortTick + 1` is a mathematical expression that will be evaluated to a different value than `requestPortTick`.

DONE.
