  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process.emit` function would not be called, skipping the unhandled rejection tracking.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array would not be searched, leading to the possibility of duplicate `unhandledRejection` events.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array would be searched from the end, potentially causing the wrong rejection to be emitted.

DONE.
