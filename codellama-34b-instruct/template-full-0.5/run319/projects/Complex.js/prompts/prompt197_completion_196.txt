  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the real part of the complex number, but the replacement code fragment uses the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the real part of the complex number, but the replacement code fragment uses the real part plus one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the imaginary part of the complex number, but the replacement code fragment uses the imaginary part multiplied by two.

DONE.
