  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the empty string to remove part of the linkurl_path, while the replacement code would not remove any part of the linkurl_path, resulting in different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"./../"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the "/index.html" part to remove the index part of the linkurl_path.The replacement code uses the relative path starting from the current folder to remove the previous folder and index file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"/../"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the "/index.html" part to remove the index part of the linkurl_path, while the replacement code uses the relative path removing the folder from where it was called, resulting in different results.

DONE.
