Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.has(name)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the existence of the policy by returning a boolean value instead of retrieving the policy object, which would lead to incorrect query results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(name + '1')
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to retrieve a policy using a modified name (appending '1'), which will likely not match any existing policy, resulting in a null return when a valid policy should have been found.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(name) || null
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly returns `null` if the policy is not found, which is redundant since the original code already returns `null` when the policy is undefined, potentially masking the actual absence of the policy.

DONE.
