  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule of this.rules.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice(1)` method returns a new array with the first element removed, which would cause the `for...of` loop to skip the first rule in the policy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule of this.rules.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method returns a new array with the elements in reverse order, which would cause the `for...of` loop to iterate over the rules in reverse order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule of this.rules.filter(r => r.name === 'admin')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter()` method returns a new array with only the rules that have a name of 'admin', which would cause the `for...of` loop to only iterate over the admin rules in the policy.

DONE.
