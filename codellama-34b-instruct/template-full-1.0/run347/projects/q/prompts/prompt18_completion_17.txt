  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Test mutation");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `flush` function to throw an error when it is called, instead of running the task.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
while (true) {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `flush` function to enter an infinite loop, preventing the task from being run.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0; // no-op
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `flush` function to do nothing, allowing the task to be run without any changes to the behavior of the program.

DONE.
