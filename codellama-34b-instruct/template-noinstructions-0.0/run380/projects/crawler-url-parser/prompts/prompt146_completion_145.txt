  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the index file extension, while the new code fragment removes the entire index file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '/default'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the index file extension, while the new code fragment replaces the index file with a default file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '/default\.[a-z]+$'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the index file extension, while the new code fragment replaces the index file with a default file with a different extension.

DONE.
