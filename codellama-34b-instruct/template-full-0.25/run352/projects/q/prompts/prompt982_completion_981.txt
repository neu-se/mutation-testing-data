  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(null));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes a function as an argument to `makeNodeResolver`, while this replacement passes `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(function() {}));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes a function as an argument to `makeNodeResolver`, while this replacement passes an empty function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(console.log));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes a function as an argument to `makeNodeResolver`, while this replacement passes `console.log`.

DONE.
