Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.reject("head");
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the method from `get` to `reject`, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the string "head" instead of retrieving the value associated with the "head" property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get("head");
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly attempts to get the "head" property from the promise instead of the "tail", which could lead to unexpected results or errors if "head" is not a valid property of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get("tail").then(function() { return "unexpected"; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a transformation of the result by returning a fixed string "unexpected" instead of the actual value from the "tail", which alters the expected output of the `get` function.

DONE.
