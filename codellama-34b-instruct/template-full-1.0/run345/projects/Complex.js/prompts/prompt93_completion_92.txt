  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not include the `isNaN(c)` check, which would cause the code to produce a different result for certain inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNaN(c)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not include the `plus + minus === 0` check, which would cause the code to produce a different result for certain inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the condition check, which would cause the code to produce a different result for certain inputs.

DONE.
