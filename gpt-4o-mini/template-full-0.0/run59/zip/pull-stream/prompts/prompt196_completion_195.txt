Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code block to always execute the first branch, effectively ignoring the abort condition and leading to potential incorrect handling of the read operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the code to proceed with the read operation even if the operation has been aborted, potentially leading to unexpected results or errors being processed incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only allow the read operation to proceed if the abort signal is explicitly null, which may not accurately reflect the intended logic of handling abort signals, potentially leading to missed abort conditions.

DONE.
