  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'http://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only replaces the protocol if it is not already present, while this modified code fragment always adds the `http://` protocol, which could result in incorrect URLs being generated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/#.*$/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only removes the fragment identifier (the part of the URL after the `#`) if it is present, while this modified code fragment always removes the fragment identifier, which could result in incorrect URLs being generated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^\/\//, 'http://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only replaces the protocol if it is not already present, while this modified code fragment always adds the `http://` protocol,
