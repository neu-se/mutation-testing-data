  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attr[key] !== base[key] || base[key] === undefined
```
This change will cause the `invert` function to always return `null` for any key that is present in both `attr` and `base`, regardless of whether the values are equal or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attr[key] !== base[key] && base[key] !== undefined
```
This change will cause the `invert` function to always return `null` for any key that is present in both `attr` and `base`, regardless of whether the values are equal or not.
