  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink.abort(abort, cb || function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `sink.abort` is called with the `abort` argument set to `true` instead of the original code which passed `null` as the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if(op && false === op(data)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` function is now called with the `data` argument instead of the original code which called `op` with a hard-coded `null` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink.abort(true, cb || function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `sink.abort` is called with the `true` value instead of the original code which passed the `abort` argument.

DONE.
