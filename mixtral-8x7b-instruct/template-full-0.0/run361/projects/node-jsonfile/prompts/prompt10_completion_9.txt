 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
eval
```
This would result in different behavior because `eval` can execute any JavaScript code and may introduce security vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Function
```
This would result in different behavior because `new Function` can also execute any JavaScript code and may introduce security vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior, similar to `eval`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
<any_global_variable>
```
This would result in different behavior because using a global variable instead of the `JSON.parse` function would not correctly parse JSON strings and may lead to unexpected results or errors.

By introducing these changes, the test suite should fail, indicating that the tests are effectively catching potential issues. DONE.
