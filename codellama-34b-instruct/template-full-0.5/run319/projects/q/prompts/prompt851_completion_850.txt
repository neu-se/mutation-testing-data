  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise, while `deferred.reject` would reject it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` would notify the promise of progress, while `deferred.reject` would reject it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` would not reject the promise, while `deferred.reject` would.

DONE.
