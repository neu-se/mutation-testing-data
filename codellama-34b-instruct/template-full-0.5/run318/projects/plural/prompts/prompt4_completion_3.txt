  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
8, -2
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the slice method would be -2 instead of -1, which would result in a different substring being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
8, -3
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the slice method would be -3 instead of -1, which would result in a different substring being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
8, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the slice method would be 1 instead of -1, which would result in a different substring being returned.

DONE.
