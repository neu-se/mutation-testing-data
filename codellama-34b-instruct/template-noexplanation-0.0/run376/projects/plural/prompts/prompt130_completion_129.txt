  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = rules.length - 1; i >= 0; i--
```
This code fragment will iterate over the `rules` array in reverse order, starting from the last element and ending at the first element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = rules.length; i > 0; i--
```
This code fragment will iterate over the `rules` array in reverse order, starting from the last element and ending at the first element, but it will skip the first element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = rules.length - 1; i >= 0; i -= 2
```
This code fragment will iterate over the `rules` array in reverse order, starting from the last element and ending at the first element, but it will skip every other element.

DONE.
