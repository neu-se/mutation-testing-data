  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(prev, { [id]: getCountry(id, options) });
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys` returns an array of keys, whereas `Object.assign` returns a new object with the assigned properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(prev, { [id]: getCountry(id, options) });
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of values, whereas `Object.assign` returns a new object with the assigned properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries(prev, { [id]: getCountry(id, options) });
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries` returns an array of key-value pairs, whereas `Object.assign` returns a new object with the assigned properties.

DONE.
