 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.inspect().state === "fulfilled" ? "rejected" : "fulfilled";
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFulfilled` function would incorrectly report rejected promises as fulfilled, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.inspect().then(function(state) { return state === "fulfilled"; }).value;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFulfilled` function would introduce an unnecessary Promise, making it less efficient and potentially causing issues with synchronous values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.inspect().state === "pending";
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFulfilled` function would incorrectly report all promises, whether fulfilled or not, as pending.

DONE.
