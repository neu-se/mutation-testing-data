  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [this, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` would refer to the global object instead of the `Q` object, which would cause the `dispatch` method to be called on the wrong object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 2)` would return an array with one fewer element than `array_slice(arguments, 1)`, which would cause the `dispatch` method to be called with the wrong number of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 0)]
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 0)` would return an array with all the arguments, which would cause the `dispatch` method to be called with the
