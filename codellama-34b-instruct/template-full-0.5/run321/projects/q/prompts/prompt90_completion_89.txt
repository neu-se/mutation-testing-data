  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis(Array.prototype.slice)
```
This would result in different behavior because `uncurryThis` is a function that takes a function as an argument and returns a new function that has the same behavior as the original function, but with the `this` keyword bound to the first argument. In this case, `uncurryThis(Array.prototype.slice)` would return a new function that slices the array, but with the `this` keyword bound to the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.slice.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` is a function that creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the provided value. In this case, `Array.prototype.slice.bind(this)` would return a new function that slices the array, but with the `this` keyword set to the current value of `this`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with
