  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'div'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment selects all anchor tags, while this new code fragment selects all div tags.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'a[href]'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment selects all anchor tags, while this new code fragment selects all anchor tags that have an href attribute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'a:not([href])'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment selects all anchor tags, while this new code fragment selects all anchor tags that do not have an href attribute.

DONE.
