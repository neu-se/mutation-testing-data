  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because it would pluralize words like "Nucleus" to "nuclei", whereas the original code would produce "Nucleuses".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pluralize words like "Nucleus" to "Nucleuses", whereas the
