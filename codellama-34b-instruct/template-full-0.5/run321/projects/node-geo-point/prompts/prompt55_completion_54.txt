  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude of the first point would be used in the calculation of the bearing, instead of the latitude of the second point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude of the second point would be increased by 1 degree, which would change the bearing calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the sine of the latitude of the second point would be used in the calculation of the bearing, instead of the latitude itself.

DONE.
