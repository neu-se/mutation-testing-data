Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the current complex number is zero instead of checking if it is infinite, which would change the outcome of the division operation when both numbers are zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the check for infinity, meaning that the condition would pass when the number is not infinite, potentially leading to incorrect results when dividing by an infinite number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the real part of the complex number is zero instead of checking for infinity, which could lead to incorrect handling of division when the real part is zero but the number itself is not infinite.

DONE.
