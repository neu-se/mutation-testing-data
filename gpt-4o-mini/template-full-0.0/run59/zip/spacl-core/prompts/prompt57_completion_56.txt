Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([*])/g
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the character class to match an asterisk (`*`) instead of a dollar sign (`$`), which alters the regex's ability to match certain path specifications.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([a-z])/g
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the character class to match any lowercase letter instead of the original characters (`.` or `$`), which could lead to incorrect path matching.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([0-9])/g
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the character class to match any digit (`0-9`), which would not match the intended characters and could cause the regex to fail in matching valid paths.

DONE.
