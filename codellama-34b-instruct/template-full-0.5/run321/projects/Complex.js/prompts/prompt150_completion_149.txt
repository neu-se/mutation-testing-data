  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'] && this['im'] > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `Complex['INFINITY']` if the complex number is infinite and has a positive imaginary part, whereas the original code would return `Complex['INFINITY']` for any infinite complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'] || this['im'] > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `Complex['INFINITY']` if the complex number is either infinite or has a positive imaginary part, whereas the original code would only return `Complex['INFINITY']` for infinite complex numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'] && this['re'] > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `Complex['INFINITY']` if the complex number is infinite and has a positive
