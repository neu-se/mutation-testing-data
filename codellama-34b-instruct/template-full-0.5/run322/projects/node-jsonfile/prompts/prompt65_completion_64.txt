  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^\uFEFF/, ' ')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the BOM character with a space, instead of removing it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^\uFEFF/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the BOM character with an empty string, instead of removing it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^\uFEFF/, 'undefined')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the BOM character with the string 'undefined', instead of removing it.

DONE.
