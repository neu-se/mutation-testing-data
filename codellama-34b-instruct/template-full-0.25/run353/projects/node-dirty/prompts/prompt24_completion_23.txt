  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the expression, so the callback function would be called even if the `if` statement is false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator short-circuits the expression, so the callback function would never be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator short-circuits the expression, so the callback function would always be called.

DONE.
