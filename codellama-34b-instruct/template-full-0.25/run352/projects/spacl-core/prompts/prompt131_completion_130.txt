  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop === undefined || match[index + 1] === prop
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator is replaced with `===` operator, which would cause the code to always return `false` if `prop` is `undefined`, regardless of the value of `match[index + 1]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop === undefined || match[index + 1] !== prop
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator is replaced with `===` operator, which would cause the code to always return `true` if `prop` is `undefined`, regardless of the value of `match[index + 1]`.
