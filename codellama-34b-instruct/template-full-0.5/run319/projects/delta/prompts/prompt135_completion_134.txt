  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasNext` returns a boolean value indicating whether the iterator has more elements, whereas `peek` returns the value of the next element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `next` advances the iterator and returns the next value, whereas `peek` returns the value of the next element without advancing the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek().next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek().next()` would return the value of the next element after advancing the iterator, whereas `peek` returns the value of the next element without advancing the iterator.

DONE.
