  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.async` returns a promise for the return value of the generator or the first rejected promise among those yielded, while `Q.reject` returns a promise that is rejected with the given reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.async` returns a promise for the return value of the generator or the first rejected promise among those yielded, while `Q.resolve` returns a promise that is resolved with the given value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.async` returns a promise for the return value of the generator or the first rejected promise among those yielded, while `Q.all` returns a promise that is resolved with an array of values if all of the promises in the input array are resolved, or rejected if any of the promises in the input array are
