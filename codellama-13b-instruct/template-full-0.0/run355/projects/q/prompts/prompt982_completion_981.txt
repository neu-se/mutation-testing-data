  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed to the `makeNodeResolver` function, which would cause the promise to be resolved with a `null` value instead of the expected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be passed to the `makeNodeResolver` function, which would cause the promise to be resolved with an `undefined` value instead of the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `1` value would be passed to the `makeNodeResolver` function, which would cause the promise to be resolved with a `1` value instead of the expected value.

DONE.
