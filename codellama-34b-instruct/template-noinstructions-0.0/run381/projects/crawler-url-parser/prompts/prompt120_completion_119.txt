  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.baseurl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `baseurl` property of `currentUrl` to `gettype()`, which is not the same as passing `baseUrl` as a separate argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `url` property of `baseUrl` to `gettype()`, which is not the same as passing `baseUrl` as a separate argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` to `gettype()`, which is not the same as passing `baseUrl` as a separate argument.

DONE.
