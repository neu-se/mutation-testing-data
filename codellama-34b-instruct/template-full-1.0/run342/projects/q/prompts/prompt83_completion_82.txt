  Option 1: The <PLACEHOLDER> can be replaced with:
```
flushing
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation operator would be omitted, always resulting in `true` for the `flushing` variable, leading to the scheduling of additional ticks even when the queue is already being flushed.

Option 2: The <PLACEHOLDER> can be replaced with:
```
!isNodeJS
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would always be `true` in a browser environment, leading to the scheduling of additional ticks even when the queue is already being flushed.

Option 3: The <PLACEHOLDER> can be replaced with:
```
!!flushing
```
This would result in different behavior because the double negation operator would always result in `true` for the `flushing` variable, leading to the scheduling of additional ticks even when the queue is already being flushed.

DONE.
