  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodeURI
```
This would result in different behavior because `decodeURI` only decodes the URI component, whereas `decodeURIComponent` decodes the entire URI.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
encodeURIComponent
```
This would result in different behavior because `encodeURIComponent` encodes the entire URI, whereas `decodeURIComponent` decodes the entire URI.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodeURIComponent(basename).toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decode the basename and convert it to lowercase, whereas the original code only decodes the basename.

DONE.
