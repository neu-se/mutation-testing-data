  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keys.push(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push a null value onto the `keys` array, which would cause the `object_keys` function to return a different result than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keys.push(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push an undefined value onto the `keys` array, which would cause the `object_keys` function to return a different result than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keys.push(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the current key onto the `keys` array, which would cause the `object_keys` function to return a different result than the original code.

DONE.
