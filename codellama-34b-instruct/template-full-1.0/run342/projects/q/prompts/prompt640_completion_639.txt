  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object)["dispatch"]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the "dispatch" property of the object rather than calling the method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(function () {
    return object.dispatch;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `then` method of the promise rather than the `dispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).get("dispatch")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `get` method of the promise rather than the `dispatch` method.

DONE.
