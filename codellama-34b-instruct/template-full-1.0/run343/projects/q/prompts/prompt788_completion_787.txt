  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(void 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would rejected the promise immediately, instead of returning the value of `object`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("Rejected"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with an error message, instead of returning the value of `object`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a null value, instead of the value of `object`.

DONE.
