  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attributes` property of the `newOp` object would be set to `null`, which would cause the `AttributeMap.compose()` method to return `null` instead of the expected object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property of the `newOp` object would be set to `0`, which would cause the `Delta.getHandler()` method to return `null` instead of the expected object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` property of the `newOp` object would be set to `null`, which would cause the `isEqual()` method to return `false` instead of the expected `true`.

DONE.
