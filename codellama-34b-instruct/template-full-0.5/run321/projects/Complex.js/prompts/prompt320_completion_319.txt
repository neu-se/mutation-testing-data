  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` term would cause the `cosh` function to return a different value, potentially leading to incorrect calculations in the `tan` and `cot` functions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` term would cause the `cosh` function to return a different value, potentially leading to incorrect calculations in the `tan` and `cot` functions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` term would cause the `cosh` function to return a different value, potentially leading to incorrect calculations in the `tan` and `cot` functions.

DONE.
