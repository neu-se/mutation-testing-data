  Sure, I can provide you with three options for the PLACEHOLDER in the code snippet you provided, along with brief explanations of the differences in behavior.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(null));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is called with an additional argument `null`, which would cause the resolver function to return `null` instead of a promise. This would mean that the promise chained from the `post` method would be resolved with `null` instead of a promise, which could potentially break the code that depends on the returned promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(Q.reject(new Error("Rejected"))));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is called with a different argument `Q.reject(new Error("Rejected"))`, which would cause the resolver function to return a rejected promise instead of a resolved one
