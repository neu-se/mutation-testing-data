  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first argument to `dispatch`, instead of passing all the arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first argument and pass the rest of the arguments to `dispatch`, instead of passing all the arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first argument to `dispatch`, instead of passing all the arguments.

DONE.
