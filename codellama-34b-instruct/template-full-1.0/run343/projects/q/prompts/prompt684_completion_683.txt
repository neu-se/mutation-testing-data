  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[arguments, 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the way the function handles its arguments, potentially causing errors or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, arguments]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the way the function handles its arguments and `void 0` constant, potentially causing errors or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[arguments, void 0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the way the function handles its arguments and `void 0` constant, potentially causing errors or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
