  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0 && b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality with 0, while this new fragment checks for greater than 0. This could cause the function to return a different value or not return a value at all, leading to incorrect calculations or errors in the project.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 || b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality with 0 for both variables, while this new fragment checks for equality with 0 for any one of the variables. This could cause the function to return a different value or not return a value at all, leading to incorrect calculations or errors in the project.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < 0 && b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality with 0, while this new fragment checks for less than 0. This could cause
