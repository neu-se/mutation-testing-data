  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would mean that the code would not track rejections anymore, as the `untrackRejection` function would be called only when the rejection is at a specific index, which is not the case when `at === -1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at = -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would mean that the code would track rejections indefinitely, as the `trackRejection` function would be called whenever `at` is set to -1, and it would never be set back to a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would mean that the code would track only the first rejection, and not any other rejections that might occur.

DONE.
