  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `dispatch` method to be called on the number 1, which would return an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `dispatch` method to be called on null, which would return an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `dispatch` method to be called on undefined, which would return undefined.

DONE.
