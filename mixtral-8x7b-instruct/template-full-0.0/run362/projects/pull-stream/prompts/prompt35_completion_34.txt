 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1] - 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the second argument to a number by performing arithmetic operations, while the original code fragment simply accesses the value at the second index of the `ref` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref['1']
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the property named "1" of the `ref` array, while the original code fragment accesses the second element of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.slice(1)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array containing all but the first element of the `ref` array and then accesses the first element of the new array, while the original code fragment simply accesses the second element of the `ref` array.

DONE.
