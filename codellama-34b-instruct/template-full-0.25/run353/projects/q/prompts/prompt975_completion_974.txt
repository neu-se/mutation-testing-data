  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(args || [])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would cause the function to always return an empty array, even if `args` is not undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(args && [])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would cause the function to always return an empty array, even if `args` is not an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(args + [])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would cause the function to always return a new array, even if `args` is not an array.

DONE.
