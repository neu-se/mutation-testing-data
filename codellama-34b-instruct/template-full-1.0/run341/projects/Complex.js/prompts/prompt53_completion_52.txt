  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.acos()` returns the arccosine of a number, whereas `Math.cos()` returns the cosine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / Math.cos(Math.atan2(b, a))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would divide `a` by the cosine of the arctangent of `b` and `a`, whereas the original code divides `a` by the cosine of the arctangent of `a` and `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(Math.atan2(b, a))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the sine of the arctangent of `b` and `a`, whereas the original code returns the cosine of the arctangent of `a` and `b`.

DONE.
