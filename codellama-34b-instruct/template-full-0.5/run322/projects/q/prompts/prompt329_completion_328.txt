  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is a keyword that can be used to throw an exception, while `reject` is not a keyword and is not defined in the code snippet provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a function that is defined in the code snippet provided, while `reject` is not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is a function that is defined in the code snippet provided, while `reject` is not.

DONE.
