  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (error instanceof Error)
```
This would result in different behavior because `instanceof` checks if an object is an instance of a class, while `===` checks if two values are the same. In this case, `error` is an instance of the `Error` class, but it may not be the same as the `Error` class itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (error.constructor === Error)
```
This would result in different behavior because `constructor` is a property of an object that refers to the function that created the object, while `Error` is a function that creates error objects. In this case, `error.constructor` may be the `Error` function, but it may not be the same as the `Error` class itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (error.name === 'Error')
```
This would result in different behavior because `name` is a property of an object that refers to the name of the
