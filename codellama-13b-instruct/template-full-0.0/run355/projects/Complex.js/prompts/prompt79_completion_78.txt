  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === ' ' || c === '\t' || c === '\n' || c === '\r'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow for the parsing of carriage return characters ('\r') in the input string, which were not previously allowed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === ' ' || c === '\t' || c === '\n' || c === '\r' || c === '\f'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow for the parsing of form feed characters ('\f') in the input string, which were not previously allowed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === ' ' || c === '\t' || c === '\n' || c === '\r' || c === '\f' || c === '\v'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow for the parsing of vertical tab characters ('\v') in the input string, which were not previously allowed.
