  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    this.dispatch.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch` is a function, and `this.dispatch.call()` is a function call, which would execute the `dispatch` function immediately, rather than returning a reference to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    <error>
```
This would result in different behavior because `<error>` is a syntax error, and the code would not run at all.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    this.dispatch. polynomial()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch` is a function, and `this.dispatch.polynomial()` is a function call with a misspelled method name, which would throw an error.
