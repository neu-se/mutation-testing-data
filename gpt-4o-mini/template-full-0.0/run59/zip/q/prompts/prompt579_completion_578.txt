Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` invokes the function with a specified `this` value and arguments, which may lead to incorrect context for `continuer`, potentially causing unexpected results when accessing `this` within the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.apply(null, ["throw"])
```
This would result in different behavior because using `apply` with `null` as the context means that `this` inside `continuer` will be `null`, which could lead to errors if `continuer` relies on `this` to access properties or methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with `this` set to `null`, which may not be the intended context for `continuer`, potentially leading to incorrect behavior when the function is executed.

DONE.
