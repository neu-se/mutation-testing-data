  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain - firstLeft < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be false, even if there are still ops to be processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain - firstLeft === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be true, even if there are still ops to be processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain - firstLeft !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be true, even if there are still ops to be processed.

DONE.
