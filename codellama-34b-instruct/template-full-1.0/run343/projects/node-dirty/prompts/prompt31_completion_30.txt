  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rm(key, () => {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function is now an empty function, so the code inside the callback (e.g., `this.emit('drain');`) would not be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(key, undefined, cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `val` parameter is now `undefined`, which would delete the key from the database instead of updating it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rm(key, undefined, cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `val` parameter is now `undefined`, which would delete the key from the database instead of updating it. Additionally, the callback function is now `undefined`, which would prevent the code from executing the callback.

DONE.
