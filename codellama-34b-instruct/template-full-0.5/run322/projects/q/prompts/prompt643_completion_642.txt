  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would omit the first two arguments of the `post` method, which could potentially cause the method to fail or produce unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, args.slice(2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would omit the first two elements of the `args` array, which could potentially cause the method to fail or produce unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, args.slice(1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would omit the first element of the `args` array, which could potentially cause the method to fail or produce unexpected results.

DONE.
