  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved, which could cause the program to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be notified instead of resolved or rejected, which could cause the program to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with a different value than the original code, which could cause the program to behave differently.

DONE.
