  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would set the value of the map to `null` instead of the `policy` object, which could cause issues when querying the map later.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would set the value of the map to `undefined` instead of the `policy` object, which could cause issues when querying the map later.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Policy()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would set the value of the map to a new `Policy` object instead of the original `policy` object, which could cause issues when querying the map later.

DONE.
