Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `null` instead of `end` would cause the callback to be invoked with `null`, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the end of the stream, as it would not signal the end of data correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `true` instead of `end` would indicate that the operation was successful, which could mislead the caller into thinking that data was processed correctly, even when it may not have been.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `data` instead of `end` would pass the actual data to the callback, which could lead to unexpected results, as the callback is expected to handle an end signal rather than data at that point in the flow.

DONE.
