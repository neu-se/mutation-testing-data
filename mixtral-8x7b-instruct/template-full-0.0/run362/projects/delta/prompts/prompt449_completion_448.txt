 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
op.hasOwnProperty('delete')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the 'delete' property exists in the op object instead of checking if it's a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
typeof (op as any).delete === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a type assertion to treat the op object as another type, changing the behavior of the type check.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.prototype.toString.call(op.delete) === '[object Number]'
