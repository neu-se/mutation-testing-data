  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `end` is truthy, while this replacement checks if `end` is strictly equal to `true`. This could cause the code to behave differently in certain edge cases where `end` is a truthy value other than `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `end` is truthy, while this replacement checks if `end` is not strictly equal to `true`. This could cause the code to behave differently in certain edge cases where `end` is a falsy value other than `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `end` is truthy, while this replacement checks if `end` is falsy. This could cause the code to behave differently in certain edge cases where `end` is
