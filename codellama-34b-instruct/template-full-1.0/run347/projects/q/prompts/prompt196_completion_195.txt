  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `getFileNameAndLineNumber` returns an array, replacing it with `undefined` would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `getFileNameAndLineNumber` returns an array, replacing it with `null` would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `getFileNameAndLineNumber` returns an array, replacing it with an empty object `{}` would cause an error.

DONE.
