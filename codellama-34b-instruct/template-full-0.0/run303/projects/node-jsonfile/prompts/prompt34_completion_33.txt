  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file + '.json'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `file` variable, which is a string, and the new code fragment is using the `file` variable with the `.json` extension, which is a string concatenation. This would cause the `readFile` and `writeFile` functions to read and write to a different file than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `file` variable, which is a string, and the new code fragment is using the `file.toUpperCase()` method, which returns a new string with all characters in uppercase. This would cause the `readFile` and `writeFile` functions to read and write to a different file than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.split('.')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because
