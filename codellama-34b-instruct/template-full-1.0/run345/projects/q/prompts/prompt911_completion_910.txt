  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.join(nodeArgs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `join` is a string method that will concatenate the elements of `baseArgs` with the elements of `nodeArgs`, resulting in a different final array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `reverse` is a method that will mutate the order of the elements in `baseArgs`, potentially causing the final array to have a different order of elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` is a method that will extract a subset of the elements in `baseArgs`, potentially causing the final array to have a different size or shape.

DONE.
