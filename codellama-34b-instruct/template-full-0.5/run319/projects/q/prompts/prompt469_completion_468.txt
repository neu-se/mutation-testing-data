  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons[at + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `at + 1` would refer to the next element in the `unhandledReasons` array, which may or may not be a valid index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons[at - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `at - 1` would refer to the previous element in the `unhandledReasons` array, which may or may not be a valid index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons[at * 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because `at * 2` would refer to the element at twice the index of `at` in the `unhandledReasons` array, which may or may not be a valid index.

DONE.
