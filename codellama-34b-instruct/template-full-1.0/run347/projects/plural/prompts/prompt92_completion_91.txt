  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chili'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns 'chillies' as the plural form of 'chilli', whereas 'chili' would be its singular form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chill'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns 'chillies' as the plural form of 'chilli', whereas 'chill' would be a completely different word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chillies'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns 'chillies' as the plural form of 'chilli', whereas the replacement code also uses 'chillies' as the plural form, which is the same as the original code.

DONE.
