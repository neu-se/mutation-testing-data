 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan(y / x)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original atan2 function is used to correctly handle the signs of both arguments, while the simple atan function would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan2(y, -x)
```
This would result in different behavior because the longitude calculation would be incorrect due to the incorrect sign of the x argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan2(Math.abs(y), Math.abs(x))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a positive result, which is not the case for the original function.

DONE.
