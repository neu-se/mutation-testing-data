 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Math.sqrt(distance) * Math.sin(bearing / 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates a point on a sphere using spherical law of cosines formula, which is not equivalent to the original implementation of `calculateDestination`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
GeoPoint.fromLatLngArray
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the `fromLatLngArray` method instead of the intended `calculateDestination` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
(this, distance * 2, bearing)
