  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function is called instead of the `fulfilled` function, which could cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fulfilled` function is called with a `null` value instead of the actual value, which could cause the promise to be resolved with a different value than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled(value + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fulfilled` function is called with a value that is one greater than the actual value, which could cause the promise to be resolved with a different value than expected.

DONE.
