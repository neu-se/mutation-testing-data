  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse` function would receive the `baseUrlStr` as an argument, which is a string that represents the base URL, instead of the `parsedBaseUrl` object, which was created by the `URL.parse` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parsedUrl.host` property contains the hostname of the URL, including the subdomain, whereas the `baseUrlStr` variable contains the full URL, including the protocol, domain, and path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parsedUrl.path` property contains the path of the URL, including any query parameters, whereas the `baseUrlStr` variable contains the full URL, including the protocol, domain, and path.

DONE.
