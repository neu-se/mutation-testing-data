  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-
```
This would result in different behavior because the unary minus operator will return the negative of the value of the expression, rather than deleting the property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!
```
This would result in different behavior because the logical NOT operator will return the opposite of the truthiness of the expression, rather than deleting the property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
~
```
This would result in different behavior because the bitwise NOT operator will return the inverse of the value of the expression, rather than deleting the property.

DONE.
