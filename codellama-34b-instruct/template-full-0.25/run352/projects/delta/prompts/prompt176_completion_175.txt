  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to skip over the last operation in the delta, potentially resulting in a different composition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to skip over the last operation in the other delta, potentially resulting in a different composition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to consider the maximum length of the two deltas, potentially resulting in a different composition.

DONE.
