  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.timezones[id]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the timezones object with the specified id, rather than the entire data object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.timezones
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the timezones object, rather than the entire data object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.timezones[id].c
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the country code for the timezone with the specified id, rather than the entire data object.

DONE.
