  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using the `continuer` function itself as an argument, but by replacing it with 0, the function will no longer be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a way to explicitly return `undefined` in JavaScript, but the original code is using `continuer` as an argument, which is not the same as `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is expecting `continuer` to be called with the `next` or `throw` verb, but by throwing an error, the function will not be called.

DONE.
