Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops[other.ops.length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the last operation in the `other.ops` array instead of the first, potentially altering the composition of the deltas.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops[0].insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the `insert` property of the first operation in `other.ops`, which may not be defined or may not represent a valid operation, leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the expected operation with `null`, which would likely cause the `concat` method to behave incorrectly, as it would not push a valid operation into the `delta` array.

DONE.
