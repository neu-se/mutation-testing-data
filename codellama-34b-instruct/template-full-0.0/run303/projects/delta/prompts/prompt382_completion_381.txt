  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to advance by one more step than the `thisIter`, potentially leading to a mismatch in the comparison of the two iterators.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to advance by one less step than the `thisIter`, potentially leading to a mismatch in the comparison of the two iterators.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length * 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to advance by twice the amount of the `thisIter`, potentially leading to a mismatch in the comparison of the two iterators.

DONE.
