  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the first occurrence of `#.*$` with an empty string, while this new code fragment replaces it with a space. This could potentially change the behavior of the `URL.parse` method, which may not handle spaces in the same way as it handles empty strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, 'http://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the first occurrence of `#.*$` with an empty string, while this new code fragment replaces it with the string `'http://'`. This could potentially change the behavior of the `URL.parse` method, which may not handle the string `'http://'` in the same way as it handles empty strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, 'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the first
