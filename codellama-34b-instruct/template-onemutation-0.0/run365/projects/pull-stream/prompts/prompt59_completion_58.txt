  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `abort`, which means that the loop will continue even if `abort` is set to `true`. In the original code, the loop would exit if `abort` is set to `true`.

DONE.
