  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"image"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `transform` method to always return an empty delta, as the `embedType` property would never be equal to the string "image".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `transform` method to always return the original delta, as the `embedType` property would never be equal to the null value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"text"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `transform` method to always return the original delta, as the `embedType` property would never be equal to the string "text".

DONE.
