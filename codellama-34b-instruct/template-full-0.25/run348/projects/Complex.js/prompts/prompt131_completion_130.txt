  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the result of `this['isInfinite']`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `this['isInfinite']` is `false`, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['isFinite']` checks if the value is a finite number, whereas `this['isInfinite']` checks if the value is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['isNaN']` checks if the value is not a number, whereas `this['isInfinite']` checks if the value is infinite.

DONE.
