  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function is called instead of the `fulfilled` function, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value is passed as an argument to the `fulfilled` function, which would cause an error to be thrown if the function expects a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value is passed as an argument to the `fulfilled` function, which would cause an error to be thrown if the function expects a value.

DONE.
