  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `b` variable, which is a complex number, and the new code fragment uses the negative of `b`, which is also a complex number but with a different magnitude and phase. This change would cause the `tanh` function to return a different value, which could potentially cause issues in the surrounding code.

DONE.
