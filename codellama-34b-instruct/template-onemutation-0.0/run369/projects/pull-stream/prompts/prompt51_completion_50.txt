  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!s
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT operator, which returns the opposite boolean value of its operand. In this case, if `s` is a function, `!s` would return `false` if `s` is truthy, and `true` if `s` is falsy. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently than the original code, depending on the context in which it is used.

DONE.
