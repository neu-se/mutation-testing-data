  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always use the `http` module instead of the `https` module, which could cause issues with secure connections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'httpss'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would try to use a non-existent module called `httpss`, which would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would concatenate the strings `'http'` and `'s'`, resulting in the string `'https'`, which is not the same as the original code fragment.

DONE.
