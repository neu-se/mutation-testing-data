  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = !end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the value of `end`, causing the `ended` variable to be set to the opposite of what it would be with the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would add 1 to the value of `end`, causing the `ended` variable to be set to a different value than it would be with the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = end - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would subtract 1 from the value of `end`, causing the `ended` variable to be set to a different value than it would be with the original code.

DONE.
