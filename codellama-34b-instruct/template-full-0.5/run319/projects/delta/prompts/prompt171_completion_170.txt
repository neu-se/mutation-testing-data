  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.max` returns the largest number in a list, whereas `Math.min` returns the smallest number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the length of the next other operation from the length of the current operation, potentially resulting in a negative value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the length of the next other operation to the length of the current operation, potentially resulting in a larger value than expected.

DONE.
