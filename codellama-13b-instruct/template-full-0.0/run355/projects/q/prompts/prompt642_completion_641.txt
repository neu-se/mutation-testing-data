  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args, 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the third element of the array would be a number instead of a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args, "1"]
```
This would result in different behavior because the third element of the array would be a string instead of a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args, "one"]
```
This would result in different behavior because the third element of the array would be a string instead of a number.

DONE.
