  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(aborted)
```
This would result in different behavior because `abortCb` is a variable that is defined in the scope of the function, but it is not used anywhere in the code. Therefore, replacing `cb` with `abortCb` would result in a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(aborted)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb` is a function that is passed as an argument to the `next` function, but it is not called anywhere in the code. Therefore, replacing `cb` with `abortCb` would result in a syntax error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb()
```
This would result in different behavior because `abortCb` is a function that is defined in the scope of the function, but it is not called anywhere in the code. Therefore, replacing `cb` with `abortCb` would result in
