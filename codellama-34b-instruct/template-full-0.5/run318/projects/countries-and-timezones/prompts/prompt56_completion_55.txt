  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones, options.deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the deprecated timezones, whereas the original code fragment returned all timezones.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones.deprecated, options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the deprecated timezones and not the other timezones, whereas the original code fragment returned all timezones.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones.allTimezones, options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return all timezones, including deprecated ones, whereas the original code fragment returned only the non-deprecated timezones.

DONE.
