  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/\*/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` character has a different meaning in a regular expression than the `/` character. The `*` character matches zero or more of the preceding character, while the `/` character matches a forward slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/\*/\//
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression now matches any number of forward slashes, while the original regular expression only matched a single forward slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/\*/\//
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression now matches any number of forward slashes, while the original regular expression only matched a single forward slash.

DONE.
