  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a || b).reduce
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `reduce` method on the result of `a || b`, which may not be an array or object with a `reduce` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(a && b).reduce
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `reduce` method on the result of `!(a && b)`, which may not be an array or object with a `reduce` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a || b).map
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `map` method on the result of `a || b`, which may not be an array or object with a `map` method.

DONE.
