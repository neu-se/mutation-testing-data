  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

This would result in different behavior because it would split the stack trace into separate lines, which could make it harder to read and understand.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\n\r"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the stack trace into separate lines, which could make it harder to read and understand.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\r"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the stack trace into separate lines, which could make it harder to read and understand.

DONE.
