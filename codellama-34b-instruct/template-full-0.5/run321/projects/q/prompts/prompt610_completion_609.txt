  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(object).dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected, rather than resolved, which could cause any code that is dependent on the promise to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch(null, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the dispatch method to be called with a null operation, which could cause an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch(op, [])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the dispatch method to be called with an empty array of arguments, which could cause an error to be thrown or result in unexpected behavior.

DONE.
