  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'+'
```
This would result in different behavior because it will cause the `replace` function to replace the first occurrence of the `/` character with `+`, instead of replacing all occurrences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'.'
```
This would result in different behavior because it will cause the `replace` function to replace the first occurrence of the `/` character with `.`, instead of replacing all occurrences.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it will cause the `replace` function to replace the first occurrence of the `/` character with `/`, which will effectively make the `replace` function perform no operation at all.

DONE.
