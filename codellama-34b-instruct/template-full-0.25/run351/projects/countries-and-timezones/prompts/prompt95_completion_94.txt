  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `country === null` would return `true` if `country` is `null`, while `!country` would return `true` if `country` is any falsy value (e.g., `null`, `undefined`, `0`, `NaN`, etc.).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `country.length === 0` would return `true` if `country` is an empty string or an empty array, while `!country` would return `true` if `country` is any falsy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country.hasOwnProperty('length') && country.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `country.hasOwnProperty('length')` would return `true` if `country` has a `length` property, while `!country` would
