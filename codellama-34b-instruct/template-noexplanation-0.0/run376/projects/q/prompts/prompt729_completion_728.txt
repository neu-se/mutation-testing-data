  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.slice(1)
```
This code fragment will return a new array containing all the elements of the `promises` array except the first one. This change will cause the `all` function to return a promise that is resolved with an array containing all the values of the input promises except the first one, which may cause the function to return a different result than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.concat([null])
```
This code fragment will return a new array containing all the elements of the `promises` array followed by a `null` value. This change will cause the `all` function to return a promise that is resolved with an array containing all the values of the input promises followed by a `null` value, which may cause the function to return a different result than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.filter(function(promise) { return promise.state === "fulfilled"; })
```
