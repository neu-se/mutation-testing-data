  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[i] !== value
```
This change will cause the `array_indexOf` function to return the index of the first element in the array that is not equal to the specified value, rather than the index of the first element that is equal to the specified value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[i] > value
```
This change will cause the `array_indexOf` function to return the index of the first element in the array that is greater than the specified value, rather than the index of the first element that is equal to the specified value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[i] < value
```
This change will cause the `array_indexOf` function to return the index of the first element in the array that is less than the specified value, rather than the index of the first element that is equal to the specified value.

DONE.
