 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.resolve([])
```
This would result in different behavior because it always resolves to an empty array, while the original code resolves to an array of the input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.all(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it treats the input value as an iterable and resolves to an array of resolved values, while the original code resolves to the input value itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.all(value).then(function(array) { return array[0]; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it only resolves to the first value of the input array, while the original code resolves to the entire array.

DONE.
