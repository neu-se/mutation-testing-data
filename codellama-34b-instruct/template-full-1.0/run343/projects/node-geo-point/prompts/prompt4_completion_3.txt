  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type !== 'Point'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `type` property of the `point` object is not equal to `'Point'`, whereas the original code fragment checks if `point` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!point.hasOwnProperty('type')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `type` property does not exist on the `point` object, whereas the original code fragment checks if `point` is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof point.type !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `type` property of the `point` object is not a string, whereas the original code fragment checks if `point` is not an object.

DONE.
