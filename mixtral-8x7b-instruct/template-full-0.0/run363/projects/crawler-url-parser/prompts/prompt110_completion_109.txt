 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
delete urlMap[baseUrlStr];
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the baseUrlStr entry from the urlMap, instead of removing the '#' and everything after it from the URLs in the page.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
urlMap.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes all entries from the urlMap, instead of removing the '#' and everything after it from the URLs in the page.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
baseUrlStr = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the baseUrlStr variable to null, instead of removing the '#' and everything after it from the URLs in the page.

DONE.
