Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= end && !iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to allow the loop to continue if `index` is equal to `end` and there are no more operations to iterate over, potentially leading to an infinite loop or skipping necessary operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < start || iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it allows the loop to continue if `index` is less than `start`, which could lead to processing operations that should be skipped, thus altering the intended slicing behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > end && iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it reverses the logic, allowing the loop to continue if `index` is greater than `end`, which is nonsensical in the context of slicing and would likely result in an error or unexpected results.

DONE.
