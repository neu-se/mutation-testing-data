  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process
```
This would result in different behavior because `process` is a global object in Node.js that provides information about the current process, whereas `promise` is a parameter that refers to the promise object being tracked for unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because `unhandledRejections` is a list of all the promises that have been rejected but not handled, whereas `process` is a global object in Node.js that provides information about the current process.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because `reportedUnhandledRejections` is a list of all the promises that have been rejected and handled, whereas `process` is a global object in Node.js that provides information about the current process.

DONE.
