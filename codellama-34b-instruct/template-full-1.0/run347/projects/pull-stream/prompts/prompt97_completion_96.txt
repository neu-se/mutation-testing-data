  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `ended`, so the code inside the `if` statement would be executed even if `ended` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, so if `ended` is `true`, the code inside the `if` statement would not be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, so if `ended` is `false`, the code inside the `if` statement would be executed.

DONE.
