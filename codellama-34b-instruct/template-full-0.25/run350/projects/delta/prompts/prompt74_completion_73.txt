  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = length;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property would be set to the `length` of the `arg` object, rather than the `length` property of the `arg` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = arg.length;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property would be set to the `length` property of the `arg` object, rather than the `length` of the `arg` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = arg.length + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property would be set to the `length` property of the `arg` object plus one, rather than the `length` of the `arg` object.

DONE.
