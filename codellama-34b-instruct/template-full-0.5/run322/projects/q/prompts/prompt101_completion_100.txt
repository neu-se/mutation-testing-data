  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback(basis, this[index], index)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be called with the wrong number of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call(this, basis, this[index], index)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be called with the wrong context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(this, [basis, this[index], index])
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be called with the wrong arguments.

DONE.
