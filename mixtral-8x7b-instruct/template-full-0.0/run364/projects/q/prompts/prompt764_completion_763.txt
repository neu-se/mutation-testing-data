 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment, `when`, is used to handle the promise and attach callbacks for fulfillment, rejection, and progress. By replacing it with `Promise.resolve()`, the behavior changes as it no longer waits for the promise to settle and immediately resolves the promise, bypassing the attached callbacks.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function (promise) { return promise; }
