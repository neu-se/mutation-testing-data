Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the policy to `null`, causing any subsequent queries to return `null` for the policy, regardless of whether the policy exists or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the policy to `undefined`, which is similar to `null`, but could lead to different handling in the `query` and `matches` methods, potentially causing confusion in the logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ name: policy.name }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new object with only the `name` property of the policy, losing all other properties and methods of the `Policy` class, which would lead to incorrect behavior when querying or matching policies.

DONE.
