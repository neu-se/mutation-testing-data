  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] == b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the values of `a[key]` and `b[key]` using the `==` operator, rather than the `!= null` check in the original code. This could cause the function to return a different result if `a[key]` and `b[key]` have different values, even if they are both not null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the values of `a[key]` and `b[key]` using the `!==` operator, rather than the `isEqual` method in the original code. This could cause the function to return a different result if `a[key]` and `b[key]` have different values, even if they are both not null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual(a[key], b[
