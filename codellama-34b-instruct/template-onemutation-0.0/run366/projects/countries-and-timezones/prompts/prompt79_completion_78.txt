  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(name)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was calling the `getTimezone` function with a hardcoded argument `tzName`, while the new code fragment is calling the `getTimezone` function with a variable `name` as an argument.

DONE.
