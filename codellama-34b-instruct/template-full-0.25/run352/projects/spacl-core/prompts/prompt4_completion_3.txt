  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^\//) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the path does not start with a slash, while this new code fragment checks if the path starts with a slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^\//) === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the path does not start with a slash, while this new code fragment checks if the path starts with a slash and returns `undefined` if it does not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^\//) !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the path does not start with a slash, while this new code fragment checks if the path starts with a slash and returns `undefined` if it does not.

DONE.
