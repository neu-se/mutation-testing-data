  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('a').attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the `href` attribute of the first `a` element in the document, whereas the original code fragment returns the value of the `href` attribute of all `a` elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('a').attr('href').trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the `href` attribute of all `a` elements, but with leading and trailing whitespace removed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('a').attr('href').replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'http://')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the `href` attribute of all `a` elements, but with the protocol prefix added if it is missing.

DONE.
