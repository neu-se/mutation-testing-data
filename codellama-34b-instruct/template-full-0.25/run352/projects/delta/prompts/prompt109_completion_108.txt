  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op) => !predicate(op)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `predicate` function, causing the `filter` method to return the opposite set of elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op) => predicate(op) && op.attributes != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional condition `op.attributes != null` would only return elements that have non-null `attributes` property, which may not be the same as the original `predicate` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op) => predicate(op) || op.attributes == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional condition `op.attributes == null` would only return elements that have null `attributes` property, which may not be the same as the original `predicate` function.

DONE.
