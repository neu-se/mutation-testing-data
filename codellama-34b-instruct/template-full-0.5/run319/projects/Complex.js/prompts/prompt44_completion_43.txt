  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== undefined && b !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checks if `b` is not undefined, while this alternative checks if `b` is not undefined and not null. If `b` is null, the original code would still consider it as defined, while this alternative would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== undefined || b !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `b` is not undefined and not null, while this alternative checks if `b` is not undefined or not null. If `b` is null, the original code would not consider it as defined, while this alternative would.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== undefined && b !== null && b !== ""
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checks if `b` is not undefined and not null, while this alternative also checks if `b` is not an empty string. If `
