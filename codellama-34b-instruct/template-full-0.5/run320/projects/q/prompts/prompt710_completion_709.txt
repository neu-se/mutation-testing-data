  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("keys", [])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys` method is not defined in the `Q` object, so it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("values", [])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `values` method is not defined in the `Q` object, so it would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("entries", [])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `entries` method is not defined in the `Q` object, so it would throw an error.

DONE.
