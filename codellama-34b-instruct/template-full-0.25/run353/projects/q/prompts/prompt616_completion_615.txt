  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a specific `this` context, which could cause the code to behave differently if the `this` context is important for the function's behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` changes the `this` context of the function to `null`, which could cause the code to behave differently if the `this` context is important for the function's behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.apply(this, [])
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` changes the `this` context of the function to `this`, but passes an empty array as the arguments, which could cause the code to behave differently if the function expects arguments.

DONE.
