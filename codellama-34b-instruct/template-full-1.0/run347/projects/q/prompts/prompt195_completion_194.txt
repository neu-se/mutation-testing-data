  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because `attempt3[3]` may not exist in the array, causing an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[attempt3.length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the last element of the `attempt3` array, which may not be the same as `attempt3[2]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber(attempt3[2])[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the line number of the third element of the `attempt3` array, which may not be the same as `attempt3[0]`.

DONE.
