  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op].apply(null, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is called with `null` as the context, which means that the `this` keyword inside the `apply` method will be `undefined`. This can cause issues if the `descriptor[op]` function relies on the `this` keyword to access properties or methods of the `descriptor` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

descriptor[op].apply(descriptor, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is called with the `descriptor` object as the context, which means that the `this` keyword inside the `apply` method will refer to the `descriptor` object. This can cause issues if the `descriptor[op]` function relies on the `this` keyword to access properties or methods of the `descriptor` object, but the `descriptor` object is not the correct context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOL
