 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method treats `null` and `undefined` differently. In the original code, passing `undefined` as an argument to `then` would ignore the argument, while passing `null` would treat it as a function that does nothing. This could potentially cause issues if the code relies on the argument being `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because a no-op function would be passed to `then` instead of `undefined`. This could cause issues if the code relies on the argument being `undefined` and behaves differently when it is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
