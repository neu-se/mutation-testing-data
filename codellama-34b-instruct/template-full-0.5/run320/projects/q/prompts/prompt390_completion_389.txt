  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolved
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolved` is a different function than `rejected`, and it would change the behavior of the `then` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error instead of returning a rejected promise, and it would change the behavior of the `then` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value instead of returning a rejected promise, and it would change the behavior of the `then` method.

DONE.
