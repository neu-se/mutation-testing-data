  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(accum, curr, index) => accum + curr.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would sum the `insert` property of each `Op` object, rather than the `retain` property as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(accum, curr, index) => accum + curr.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would sum the `delete` property of each `Op` object, rather than the `retain` property as in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(accum, curr, index) => accum + curr.attributes.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would sum the length of the `attributes` property of each `Op` object, rather than the `retain` property as in the original code.

DONE.
