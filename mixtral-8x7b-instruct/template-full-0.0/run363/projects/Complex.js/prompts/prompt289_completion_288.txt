 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.sinh` function expects a single numeric argument, while the original code fragment `sinh` is a reference to the `sinh` method of the Complex object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing the function reference with a constant value would cause the result of the `cos` method to always be 0, regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.sinh` would attempt to call the `sinh` method on the current object, which may not have a `sinh` method defined.

DONE.
