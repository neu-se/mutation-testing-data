 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because Math.cosh is the hyperbolic cosine function, which is different from the original Math.cos (cosine function).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin
