  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `text` method to get the text content of the current element, while the replaced code fragment uses the `attr` method to get the `href` attribute of the current element.

DONE.
