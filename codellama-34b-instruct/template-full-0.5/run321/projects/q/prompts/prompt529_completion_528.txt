  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return "fulfilled"; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the string "fulfilled", regardless of the state of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { throw new Error("rejected"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always throw an error, regardless of the state of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return Q(object).inspect(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the result of calling the `inspect` method on the `Q` object, regardless of the state of the promise.

DONE.
