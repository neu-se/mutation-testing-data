  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w, regex) {
  if (w === 'dwarf' || w === 'roof') {
    return w + 's'
  }
  return w.replace(regex, 'ves')
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a regular expression to replace the matched substring with "ves", while this new code fragment uses a simple string concatenation to add "s" to the end of the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) {
  return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies'
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a regular expression to match the last character of the word and replace it with "ies", while this new code fragment uses a substring operation to remove the last character of the word and add "ies" to the end of the word.
