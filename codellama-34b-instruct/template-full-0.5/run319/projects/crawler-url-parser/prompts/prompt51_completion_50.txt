  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because `parsedUrl` is the parsed URL object, while `parsedBaseUrl` is the parsed base URL object. Using `parsedUrl` would cause the code to use the wrong URL object, leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl.href
```
This would result in different behavior because `parsedBaseUrl.href` is the full URL of the base URL, while `parsedUrl` is the parsed URL object. Using `parsedBaseUrl.href` would cause the code to use the wrong URL object, leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(parsedUrl.href)
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.parse(parsedUrl.href)` is the parsed URL object for the URL, while `parsedBaseUrl` is the parsed base URL object. Using `URL.parse(par
