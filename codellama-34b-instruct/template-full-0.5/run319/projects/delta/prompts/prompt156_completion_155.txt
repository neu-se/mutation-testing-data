  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength()` returns the length of the next op in the iterator, which may not be the same as the length of the current op.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength()` returns the length of the next op in the iterator, which may not be the same as the length of the current op.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekType()` returns the type of the next op in the iterator, which may not be the same as the type of the current op.

DONE.
