  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because null is a falsy value, and would cause the `reject()` function to be called with a null value instead of the exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because undefined is a falsy value, and would cause the `reject()` function to be called with an undefined value instead of the exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because 0 is a falsy value, and would cause the `reject()` function to be called with a 0 value instead of the exception.

DONE.
