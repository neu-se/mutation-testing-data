  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNumber
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNumber` would check if the value is a number, while `isObject` checks if the value is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isString
```
This would result in different behavior because `isString` would check if the value is a string, while `isObject` checks if the value is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFunction
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFunction` would check if the value is a function, while `isObject` checks if the value is an object.

DONE.
