Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the callback with a `null` value instead of the `aborted` error, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the abort condition in the calling code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb('error')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a string 'error' to the callback instead of the actual `aborted` error, which could mislead the caller about the nature of the error that occurred.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(aborted + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to perform an arithmetic operation on the `aborted` value, which is likely an error object, leading to unexpected results and potentially crashing the application if the error handling does not account for this.

DONE.
