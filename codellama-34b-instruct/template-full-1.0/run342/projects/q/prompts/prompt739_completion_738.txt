  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve("");
```
This would result in different behavior because a resolved promise with an empty string value would be returned, instead of a rejected promise with a TypeError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject("");
```
This would result in different behavior because a rejected promise with an empty string value would be returned, instead of a resolved promise with an empty object value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(new Error());
```
This would result in different behavior because a resolved promise with an Error object value would be returned, instead of a rejected promise with a TypeError.

DONE.
