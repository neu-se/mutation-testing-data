  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was intended to resolve the deferred promise with the value passed as an argument, while this modified code fragment would resolve the promise with a different value (i.e., the original value plus 1).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was intended to resolve the deferred promise with a specific value, while this modified code fragment would not provide any value to the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(reason + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was intended to reject the deferred promise with a specific reason, while this modified code fragment would reject the promise with a different reason (i.e., the original reason plus 1).

DONE.
