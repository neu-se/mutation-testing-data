  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `end` variable, causing the `while` loop to run indefinitely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end + 1` expression would cause the `while` loop to run one extra iteration, potentially leading to an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end - 1` expression would cause the `while` loop to run one less iteration, potentially leading to a different outcome.

DONE.
