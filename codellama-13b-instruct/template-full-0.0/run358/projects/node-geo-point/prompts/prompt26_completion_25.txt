  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `deg2rad` is a function that converts degrees to radians, while `Math.PI` is a constant that represents the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. Replacing `deg2rad` with `Math.PI` would cause the code to calculate the latitude and longitude in radians instead of degrees, which could result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.E
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `deg2rad` is a function that converts degrees to radians, while `Math.E` is a constant that represents the base of the natural logarithm. Replacing `deg2rad` with `Math.E` would cause the code to calculate the latitude and longitude in a different way, which could result in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(2)
```
