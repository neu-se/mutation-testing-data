  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [key]: tzs[key].deprecated }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the timezone is deprecated, but this change would always return the deprecated property of the timezone, regardless of whether it is deprecated or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [key]: tzs[key].name }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the timezone name as the key in the object, but this change would use the timezone's deprecated property as the key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [key]: tzs[key].timezones }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the timezone's timezones property as the value in the object, but this change would use the timezone's deprecated property as the value.

DONE.
