  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred` is a pending promise that may be resolved or rejected later, whereas `object` is a promise that is already resolved with the value of the `object` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 2)])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 2)])` would return a promise for the result of the operation, whereas `deferred` is a pending promise that may be resolved or rejected later.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(deferred).dispatch("post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 2)])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(deferred).dispatch("post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 2)])` would return a promise
