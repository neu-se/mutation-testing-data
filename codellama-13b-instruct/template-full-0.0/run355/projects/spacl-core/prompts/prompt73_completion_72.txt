  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, ctx.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method is being called on the `ctx` object, which would cause the `query()` method to return `null` instead of `true` or `false`. This would indicate that the test suite is not effective in detecting this type of bug.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, ctx.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method is being called on the `ctx` object, which would cause the `query()` method to return `null` instead of `true` or `false`. This would indicate that the test suite is not effective in detecting this type of bug.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, ctx.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method is being called on the `ctx` object, which would cause the
