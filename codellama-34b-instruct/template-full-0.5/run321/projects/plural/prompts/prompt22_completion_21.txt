  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus|randomword/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the new word "randomword" would be matched by the regular expression, even though it is not a valid word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus|[a-zA-Z]+/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the new regular expression would match any sequence of one or more letters, regardless of whether it is a valid word or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus|[^a-zA-Z]/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the new regular expression would match any character that is not a letter, regardless of whether it is a valid word or not.
