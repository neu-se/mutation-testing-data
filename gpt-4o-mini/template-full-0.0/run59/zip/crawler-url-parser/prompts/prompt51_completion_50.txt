Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the base URL string instead of the parsed base URL object, potentially leading to incorrect URL resolution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the parsed current URL instead of the parsed base URL, which could cause the resolution of the URL to be based on the wrong context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` to the `URL.resolve` function, which would not resolve the URL correctly and could lead to unexpected results or errors.

DONE.
