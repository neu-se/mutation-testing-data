  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(object).inspect();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `spread` function to return the result of `Q(object).inspect()` instead of the result of `fulfilled.apply(void 0, array)`. This could cause the `spread` function to return a different value than the original code, which could affect the behavior of the code that uses the `spread` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return fulfilled.apply(void 0, array);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `spread` function to return the result of `fulfilled.apply(void 0, array)` instead of the result of `Q(object).inspect()`. This could cause the `spread` function to return a different value than the original code, which could affect the behavior of the code that uses the `spread` function.
