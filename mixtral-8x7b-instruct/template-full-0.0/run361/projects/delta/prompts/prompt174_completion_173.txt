 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the sum of the lengths instead of the minimum.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the maximum of the lengths instead of the minimum.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns 0, regardless of the lengths.

DONE.
