  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates[0]
```
This code fragment will return the first element of the `coordinates` array, which is the latitude value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates[1]
```
This code fragment will return the second element of the `coordinates` array, which is the longitude value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates[0] + point.coordinates[1]
```
This code fragment will return the sum of the latitude and longitude values, which is a different behavior than the original code fragment.

DONE.
