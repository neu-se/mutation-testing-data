  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.join("")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the stack traces with an empty string, rather than with the separator string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.join(" ")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the stack traces with a space, rather than with the separator string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.join("\n")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the stack traces with a newline character, rather than with the separator string.

DONE.
