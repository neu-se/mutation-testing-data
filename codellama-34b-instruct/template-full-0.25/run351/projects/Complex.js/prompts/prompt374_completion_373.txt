  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `2 * b`, which is the double of the imaginary part of the complex number, while the replaced code fragment uses `2 * a`, which is the double of the real part of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `2 * b`, which is the double of the imaginary part of the complex number, while the replaced code fragment uses `a + b`, which is the sum of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `2 * b`, which is the double of the imaginary part of the complex number, while the replaced code fragment uses `a - b`, which is the difference of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number.
