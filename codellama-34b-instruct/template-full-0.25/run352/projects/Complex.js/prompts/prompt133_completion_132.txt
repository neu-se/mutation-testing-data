  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is not defined on the `z` object, so it would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite'] = true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` property is not defined on the `z` object, so it would create a new property on the object with the value `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite'] = function() { return true; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is not defined on the `z` object, so it would create a new method on the object that always returns `true`.

DONE.
