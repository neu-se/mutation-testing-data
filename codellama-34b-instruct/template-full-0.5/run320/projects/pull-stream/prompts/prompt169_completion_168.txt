  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, onAbort, abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments has been changed, which could cause issues if the function is called with the wrong arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, null, onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because a `null` value has been added as the second argument, which could cause issues if the function is not designed to handle null values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort, abort, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments has been reversed, which could cause issues if the function is called with the wrong arguments.

DONE.
