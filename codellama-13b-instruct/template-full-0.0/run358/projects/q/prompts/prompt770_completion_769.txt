  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.all()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.all()` is a method that returns a promise for an array of promises, whereas `this` is a promise for an array of values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.allSettled()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.allSettled()` is a method that returns a promise for an array of states (as returned by `inspect`) when all the promises have settled, whereas `this` is a promise for an array of values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.allResolved()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.allResolved()` is a method that returns a promise for an array of promises when all the promises have settled, whereas `this` is a promise for an array of values.

DONE.
