Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.unshift(reason.stack);
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the stack trace to the beginning of the `unhandledReasons` array instead of the end, which changes the order of the reasons stored.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.push(reason.message);
```
This would result in different behavior because it stores only the error message instead of the full stack trace, potentially losing important debugging information.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.push(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a `null` value to the `unhandledReasons` array, which could lead to confusion or errors when trying to process the reasons later.

DONE.
