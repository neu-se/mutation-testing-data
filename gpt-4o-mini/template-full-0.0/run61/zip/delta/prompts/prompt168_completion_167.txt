Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek()` returns the next operation without advancing the iterator, potentially causing the same operation to be processed multiple times instead of moving forward in the sequence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `otherIter` iterator instead of `thisIter`, which would lead to operations from the other delta being processed instead of the current delta's operations, resulting in incorrect composition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it advances the iterator by a fixed length of 1, which may not correspond to the actual length of the operation being processed, potentially skipping or incorrectly processing operations.

DONE.
