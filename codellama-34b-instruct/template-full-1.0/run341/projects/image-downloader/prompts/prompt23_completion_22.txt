  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
__dirname + ".."
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the path to the parent directory of `__dirname`, rather than the current directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
__dirname + "./"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the path to the current directory, rather than the parent directory.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
__dirname + "/"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the path to the root of the current drive, rather than the current directory.

DONE.
