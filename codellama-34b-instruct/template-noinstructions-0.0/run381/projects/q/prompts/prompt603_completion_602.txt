  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred` is not a function and would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer()` is a function call and would cause the function to be executed immediately, rather than being passed as a reference to `Q.nextTick`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` is a function call and would cause the function to be executed immediately, rather than being passed as a reference to `Q.nextTick`.

DONE.
