  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{value: p.stackCounter + 1, configurable: true}
```
This would result in different behavior because the stack counter would be incremented by 1, which would cause the `isStopIteration` function to return `false` when it should return `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{value: p.stackCounter - 1, configurable: true}
```
This would result in different behavior because the stack counter would be decremented by 1, which would cause the `isStopIteration` function to return `true` when it should return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{value: p.stackCounter * 2, configurable: true}
```
This would result in different behavior because the stack counter would be multiplied by 2, which would cause the `isStopIteration` function to return `false` when it should return `true`.

DONE.
