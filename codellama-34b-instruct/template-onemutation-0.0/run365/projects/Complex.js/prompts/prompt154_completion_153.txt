  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] === 0 && this['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the imaginary part of the complex number is zero, but it would also check if the real part of the complex number is zero, which is not the case in the original code fragment.

DONE.
