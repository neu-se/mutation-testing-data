  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, iter.next().attributes || {}, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `predicate` function with the wrong arguments. The `predicate` function expects a `line` argument, which is a `Delta` object, but `iter.next().attributes || {}` would return an `AttributeMap` object, which is not a `Delta` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, iter.next().attributes || {}, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `predicate` function with the wrong arguments. The `predicate` function expects a `line` argument, which is a `Delta` object, but `iter.next().attributes || {}` would return an `AttributeMap` object, which is not a `Delta` object.
