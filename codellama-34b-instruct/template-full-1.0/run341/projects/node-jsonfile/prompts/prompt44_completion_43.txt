  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the `options` object, which would cause an error if the object is not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'foo' + options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the string `'foo'` with the `options` object, which would produce a result that is different from the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.bar
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the `bar` property of the `options` object, which may not exist or have a different value.

DONE.
