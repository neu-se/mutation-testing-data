  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 Math.PI / 2 - a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the angle of the complex number, while this code fragment calculates the negative of the angle.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the angle of the complex number, while this code fragment calculates the double of the angle.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1- a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the angle of the complex number, while this code fragment calculates the complement of the angle.

DONE.
