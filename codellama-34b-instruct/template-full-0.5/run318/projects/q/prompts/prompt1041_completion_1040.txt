  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve({
    head: value,
    tail: next.promise
});
ends.resolve = next.resolve;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the `ends.promise` with the `next.promise` instead of the `next.resolve`, which could cause the `get` method to return a rejected promise instead of a resolved one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve({
    head: value,
    tail: next.promise
});
ends.resolve = next.reject;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the `ends.promise` with the `next.promise` instead of the `next.resolve`, and then reject the `ends.promise` with the `next.reject` function, which could cause the `get` method to return a rejected promise instead of a resolved one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.
