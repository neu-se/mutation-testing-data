  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 4
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the fourth argument of the function instead of the first, which could potentially cause issues with the function's functionality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a null value as the first argument instead of the actual argument, which could cause the function to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the arguments array as the first argument instead of the actual argument, which could cause the function to fail or behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
