  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method would return a new delta with the first op of `other` prepended to the `this` delta, rather than concatenating the two deltas.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method would return a new delta with the first op of `other` appended to the `this` delta, rather than concatenating the two deltas.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method would return a new delta with the first op of `other` inserted at the specified index in the `this` delta, rather than concatenating the two deltas.

DONE.
