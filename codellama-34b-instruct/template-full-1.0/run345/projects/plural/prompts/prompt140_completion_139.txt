  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code `rule[0]` would be replace with the number 1, which would cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the code `rule[0]` would be replace with null, which would cause the function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the code `rule[0]` would be replace with undefined, which would cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
