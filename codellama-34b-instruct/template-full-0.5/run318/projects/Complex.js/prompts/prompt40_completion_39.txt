  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the sum of `a` and `b`, regardless of their values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the difference between `a` and `b`, regardless of their values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the difference between `b` and `a`, regardless of their values.

DONE.
