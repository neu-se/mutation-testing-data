  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb || done
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb || function () {}` checks if `cb` is a truthy value and if not, it executes an anonymous function. However, replacing it with `cb || done` would result in a different behavior because it would execute the `done` callback function instead of an anonymous function when `cb` is not truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || done
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb || function () {}` checks if `cb` is a truthy value and if not, it executes an anonymous function. However, replacing it with `abort || done` would result in a different behavior because it would execute the `done` callback function instead of the `abort` callback function when `abort` is not truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op(data) || done
```
This would result in different behavior because
