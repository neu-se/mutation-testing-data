  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
- Math.cos 
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the value of `b` is added to `a` before determining the result of the function call, while in the buggy code fragment, `b` is subtracted from `a`. As a result, the resulting angle would be different, leading to incorrect calculations in dependent tests.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
- Math.random () 
```
This would result in different behavior because the function call would return a random number, which would cause the tests to fail because the function's return value would not match the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
- Math.sqrt(1 - a*a) - b * b 
```
This would result in different behavior because the function call would return a different value, which would cause the tests to fail.

DONE.
