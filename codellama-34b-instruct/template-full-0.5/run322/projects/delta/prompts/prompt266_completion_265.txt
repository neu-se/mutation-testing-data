  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to skip over one iteration, potentially leading to an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to execute one extra iteration, potentially leading to an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate twice as many times as it should, potentially leading to an incorrect result.

DONE.
