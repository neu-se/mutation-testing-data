 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
otherIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the type being 'insert' and returns a boolean, while the original code fragment checks if the type is 'insert' and returns the type itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
otherIter.peek()?.type
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly accesses the 'type' property of the peeked operation, while the original code fragment checks if the type is 'insert'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'insert' === otherIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the strict equality operator (`===`) instead of the loose equality operator (`==`), which is used in the original code fragment.

DONE.
