  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'e' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds 's' to the end of the word, while this new fragment adds 'e'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds 's' to the end of the word, while this new fragment adds 'ies'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'oes' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds 's' to the end of the word, while this new fragment adds 'oes'.

DONE.
