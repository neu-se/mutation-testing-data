  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments to `spread` is reversed, which would cause the `fulfilled` callback to be called with the rejected value instead of the `rejected` callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, null
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra `null` argument is added to the call to `spread`, which would cause the `fulfilled` callback to be called with an extra argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, fulfilled, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra `undefined` argument is added to the call to `spread`, which would cause the `rejected` callback to be called with an extra argument.

DONE.
