  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `this` refers to the current object, while `null` would refer to the null object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `this` refers to the current object, while `undefined` would refer to the undefined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `this` refers to the current object, while `0` would refer to the number 0.

DONE.
