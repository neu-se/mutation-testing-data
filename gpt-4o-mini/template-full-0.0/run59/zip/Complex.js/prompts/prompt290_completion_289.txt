Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it alters the value of `b` by adding 1, which would change the calculation of the sine function, potentially leading to incorrect results for the complex cosine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it doubles the value of `b`, which would affect the calculation of the sine function and yield incorrect results for the complex cosine.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces `b` with the real part of the complex number (`this['re']`), which would completely change the intended calculation of the complex cosine function.

DONE.
