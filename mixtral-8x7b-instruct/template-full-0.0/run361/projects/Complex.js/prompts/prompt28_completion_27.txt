 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 *
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the absolute value of `a` by 1, which doesn't change the value but introduces an unnecessary operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the square root of the absolute value of `a`, which is not the same as the original absolute value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns 0, regardless of the value of `a`.

DONE.
