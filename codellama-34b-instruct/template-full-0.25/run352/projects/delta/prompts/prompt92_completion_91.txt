  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `>` operator would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if `index` is equal to `this.ops.length`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<` operator would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if `index` is greater than `this.ops.length`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index !== this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if `index` is equal to `this.ops.length`.

DONE.
