  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a variable, while the new code fragment is a constant.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a variable, while the new code fragment is a special value that represents the absence of any value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file + '.json'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a variable, while the new code fragment is a string that is the result of concatenating the variable `file` with the string `.json`.

DONE.
