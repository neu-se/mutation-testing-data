  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'abs' in a && 'arg' in b
```
This would result in different behavior because the second operand is now `b` instead of `a`, which would cause the condition to always be false if `b` does not have the `arg` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'abs' in a && 'arg' in a && a !== b
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional condition `a !== b` would cause the condition to be false if `a` and `b` are the same object, even if they both have the `abs` and `arg` properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'abs' in a && 'arg' in a && a !== b && b !== a
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional condition `b !== a` would cause the condition to be false if `a` and `b` are the same object, even if they both have the `abs`
