  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { throw new Error("Testing mutation"); }
```
This code fragment will cause the `definition` function to throw an error when it is called, which will cause the test suite to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return "Testing mutation"; }
```
This code fragment will cause the `definition` function to return a string instead of a function, which will cause the test suite to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return function () { throw new Error("Testing mutation"); }; }
```
This code fragment will cause the `definition` function to return a function that throws an error when it is called, which will cause the test suite to fail.

DONE.
