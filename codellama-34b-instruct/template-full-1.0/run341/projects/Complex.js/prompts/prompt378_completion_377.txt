  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the function is expected to return the result of the `asin` function applied to `a`, but with `b` it would return the result of the `asin` function applied to `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the function is expected to return the result of the `asin` function applied to `a`, but with `a + b` it would return the result of the `asin` function applied to `a + b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the function is expected to return the result of the `asin` function applied to `a`, but with `a - b` it would return the result of the `asin` function applied to `a - b`.

DONE.
