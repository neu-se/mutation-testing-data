  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, fulfilled, progress
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments has been reversed, causing the `rejected` callback to be called instead of the `fulfilled` callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progress, "extra argument"
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument has been added to the end of the argument list, which would cause the `rejected` callback to be called with an unexpected argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progress, null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` has been added as an extra argument to the end of the argument list, which would cause the `rejected` callback to be called with a `null` argument instead of the expected `reason` argument.

DONE.
