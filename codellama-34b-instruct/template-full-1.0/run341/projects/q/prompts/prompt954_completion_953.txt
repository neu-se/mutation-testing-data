  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with an `undefined` value, which is different from the original behavior where the promise is rejected with the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with a `null` value, which is different from the original behavior where the promise is rejected with the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with an `undefined` value, which is different from the original behavior where the promise is rejected with the error.

DONE.
