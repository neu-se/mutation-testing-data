  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.then(function(value) { return value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of the promise, while the new code fragment returns a new promise that resolves to the value of the original promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.then(function(value) { return value + 1; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of the promise, while the new code fragment returns a new promise that resolves to the value of the original promise plus 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.then(function(value) { return value * 2; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of the promise, while the new code fragment returns a new promise that resolves to the value of the original promise multiplied by 2.

DONE.
