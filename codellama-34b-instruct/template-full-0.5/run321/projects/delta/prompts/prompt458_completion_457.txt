  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset = 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `offset` property would be initialized to 1 instead of 0, which could affect the behavior of the `next()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index = this.ops.length - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` property would be initialized to the length of the `ops` array minus 1, which could affect the behavior of the `hasNext()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops = [];
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ops` property would be set to an empty array, which could affect the behavior of the `next()` method.

DONE.
