  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, fulfilled, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, which could cause the promise to be resolved with the wrong value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, progressed, fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` callback is now being passed as the second argument instead of the third, which could cause it to be called at the wrong time.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressed, fulfilled, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` callback is now being passed as the first argument instead of the third, which could cause it to be called at the wrong time.

DONE.
