  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.reduce((a, b) => a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the sum of all operations in the `ops` array, rather than the reduced value of the `ops` array using the `predicate` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.reduce((a, b) => a * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the product of all operations in the `ops` array, rather than the reduced value of the `ops` array using the `predicate` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.reduce((a, b) => a + b - c)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the sum of all operations in the `ops` array, minus the result of the `c` operation, rather than the reduced value of the `ops` array using the `predicate` function.
