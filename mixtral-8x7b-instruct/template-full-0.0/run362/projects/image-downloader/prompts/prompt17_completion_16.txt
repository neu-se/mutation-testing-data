 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'dummy'
```
This would result in different behavior because the destination path would be appended with the string 'dummy' instead of the decoded basename from the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the destination path would be appended with a random number instead of the decoded basename from the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url
```
This would result in different behavior because the destination path would be appended with the URL string instead of the decoded basename from the URL.

DONE.
