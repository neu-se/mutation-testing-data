  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (var key in object) {
    if (object_hasOwnProperty(object, key)) {
        keys.push(key);
    }
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over all properties of the object, not just the own properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (var key in object) {
    if (object_hasOwnProperty(object, key) && typeof object[key] === "function") {
        keys.push(key);
    }
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only push keys that refer to functions, not all own properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (var key in object) {
    if (object_hasOwnProperty(object, key) && key.indexOf("_") === 0) {
        keys.push(key);
    }
}
```
This would result in different
