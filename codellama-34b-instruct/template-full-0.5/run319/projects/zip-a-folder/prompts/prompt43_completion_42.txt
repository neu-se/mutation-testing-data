  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
globPart + "/*"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include all the files in the directory and its subdirectories, whereas the original code fragment only includes the files in the directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
globPart + "/*.txt"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only include files with the ".txt" extension, whereas the original code fragment includes all files regardless of their extension.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
globPart + "/*.{txt,html,css}"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only include files with the ".txt", ".html", or ".css" extension, whereas the original code fragment includes all files regardless of their extension.

DONE.
