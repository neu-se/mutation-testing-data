  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
utcOffset + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `utcOffset` value would be incremented by 1, which would affect the calculation of the `utcOffsetStr` and potentially the `dstOffsetStr` as well.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
utcOffset * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `utcOffset` value would be multiplied by 2, which would affect the calculation of the `utcOffsetStr` and potentially the `dstOffsetStr` as well.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
utcOffset - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `utcOffset` value would be decremented by 1, which would affect the calculation of the `utcOffsetStr` and potentially the `dstOffsetStr` as well.

DONE.
