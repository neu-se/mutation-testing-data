  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the latitude of the destination point using the latitude of the origin point, rather than the latitude of the origin point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the longitude of the destination point using the longitude of the origin point, rather than the longitude of the origin point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the latitude of the destination point using a random angle, rather than the angle between the origin and destination points.

DONE.
