  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!hasStacks &&
        promise.stack &&
        typeof error === "object" &&
        error !== null &&
        error.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the logic of the original code fragment, causing the `makeStackTraceLong` function to be called only if `hasStacks` is false, `promise.stack` is truthy, `error` is an object that is not null, and `error.stack` exists.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
hasStacks ||
        !promise.stack ||
        typeof error !== "object" ||
        error === null ||
        !error.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the logic of the original code fragment, causing the `makeStackTraceLong` function to be called only if `hasStacks` is true, `promise.stack` is falsy, `error` is not an object or is null, or `error.stack` does not exist.
