  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `any` function to return a rejected promise if the input array is empty, whereas the original code would return a resolved promise with the value `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `any` function to return a rejected promise if the input array is empty, whereas the original code would return a resolved promise with the value `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `any` function to return a rejected promise if the input array is empty, whereas the original code would return a resolved promise with the value `undefined`.

DONE.
