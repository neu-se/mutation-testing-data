  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would reject the promise instead of resolving it, which would cause the promise to be in a rejected state instead of a fulfilled state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` would send a notification to the promise's progress callback instead of resolving the promise, which would cause the promise to be in a pending state instead of a fulfilled state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve(null)` would resolve the promise with a null value instead of the original value, which would cause the promise to be fulfilled with a different value than the original code.

DONE.
