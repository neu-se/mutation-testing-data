  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the prototype of the `object` rather than the object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an empty object rather than the object with keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a function rather than the object with keys.

DONE.
