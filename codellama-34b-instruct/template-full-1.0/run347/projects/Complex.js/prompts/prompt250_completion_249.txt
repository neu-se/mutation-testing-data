  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the unary ! operator would invert the value of the expression, causing the `<PLACEHOLDER>` to evaluate to a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos+1
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression would be changed from a simple function call to a more complex expression, and the outcome would likely be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(cos)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function would be applied to the value returned by `cos`, which would likely lead to a different result.

DONE.
