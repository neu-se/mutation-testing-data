  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(abort, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `read` function with the `abort` and `cb` arguments, which is not the intended behavior of the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(null, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `read` function with `null` as the first argument, which is not the intended behavior of the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(abort, function(err) {
  cb(err)
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `read` function with the `abort` argument and a callback function that calls the `cb` function with the `err` argument, which is not the intended behavior of the original code fragment.

DONE.
