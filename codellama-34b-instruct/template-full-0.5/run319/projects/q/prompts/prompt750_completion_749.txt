  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `onRejected` function to only be called if there are still pending promises, whereas the original code would call it regardless of the number of pending promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount === promises.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `onRejected` function to only be called if all promises have been rejected, whereas the original code would call it for any rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `onRejected` function to only be called if the current promise has been rejected, whereas the original code would call it for any rejected promise.

DONE.
