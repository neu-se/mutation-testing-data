 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
(op: any, index: number) => predicate(index, op)
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments of the predicate function are swapped, which could lead to incorrect filtering or mapping results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
(op: Op, index: unknown) => predicate(op, index)
```
This would result in different behavior because the type of the `index` argument is changed from `number` to `unknown`. This could lead to type-checking errors or unexpected behavior when using type-narrowing techniques in the predicate function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
(op: Op, index: number) => predicate(op)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` argument is removed from the predicate function. This could lead to incorrect filtering or mapping results, as the predicate function may not have access to the
