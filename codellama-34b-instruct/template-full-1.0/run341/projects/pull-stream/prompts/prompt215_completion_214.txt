  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(err, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because `abortCb` is a callback function that takes two arguments, but the original code only passed `abortCb` one argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(abort, err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passed `err` as the first argument to `cb`, but the mutated code passes `abort` first.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb.cb(err, abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because `abortCb.cb` is a function that takes two arguments, but the original code passed `abortCb` as the first argument to `cb`, which is not a function and does not take any arguments.

DONE.
