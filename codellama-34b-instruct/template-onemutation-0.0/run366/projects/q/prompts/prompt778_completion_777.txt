  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect(promise.isFulfilled())
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.isFulfilled()` returns a boolean value indicating whether the promise is fulfilled, whereas `promise.inspect()` returns an object with information about the promise's state. Using `promise.isFulfilled()` in this context would cause the `allSettled` method to always return a promise that is fulfilled with a value of `true`, regardless of the state of the original promise.
