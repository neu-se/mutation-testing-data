  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the data from the map instead of retrieving it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.has
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the key exists in the map instead of retrieving the value associated with the key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.keys
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of the keys in the map instead of retrieving the value associated with the key.

DONE.
