  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `_rejected` is a function that returns a rejected promise with the specified exception, whereas `_fulfilled` is a function that returns the resolved value of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because `_progressed` is a function that returns a promise that notifies the progress of the original promise, whereas `_fulfilled` and `_rejected` are functions that return a resolved or rejected promise, respectively.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise with the specified exception, whereas `_fulfilled` is a function that returns the resolved value of the promise.

DONE.
