  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
source(null, function (end, data) {
  //if ended immediately, and no initial...
  if(end) return cb(end === true ? null : end)
  acc = data; sink(<PLACEHOLDER>)
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `source` function is called with a different callback function, which would cause the `sink` function to be called with a different set of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
source(null, function (end, data) {
  //if ended immediately, and no initial...
  if(end) return cb(end === true ? null : end)
  acc = data; sink(<PLACEHOLDER>)
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `source` function is called with a different callback function, which would cause the `sink` function to be called with a different set of arguments.
