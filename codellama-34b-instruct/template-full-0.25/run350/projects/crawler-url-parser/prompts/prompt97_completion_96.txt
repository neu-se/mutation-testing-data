  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl || currentUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true`, even if `currentUrl` is `null` or `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl && currentUrl.url != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only evaluate to `true` if `currentUrl` is not `null` or `undefined` and `currentUrl.url` is not `null` or `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl && currentUrl.url !== ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only evaluate to `true` if `currentUrl` is not `null` or `undefined` and `currentUrl.url` is not an empty string.

DONE.
