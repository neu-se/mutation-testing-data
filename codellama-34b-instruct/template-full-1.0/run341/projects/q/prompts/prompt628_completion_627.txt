  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q["return"] = function () {};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `return` function would always return immediately, rather than waiting for the promise to be settled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q["return"] = function (value) {
    throw value;
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `return` function would throw the given value, rather than returning it as a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q["return"] = function (value) {
    return Q(value)
        .then(function (value) {
            return value;
        });
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `return` function would return a promise that resolves to the given value, rather than returning the value directly.

DONE.
