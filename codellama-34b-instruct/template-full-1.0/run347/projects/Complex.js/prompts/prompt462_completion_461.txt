  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` was replaced with `a * b`, which would change the result of the computation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` was replaced with `a + b`, which would change the result of the computation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` was replaced with `a * Math.random()`, which would multiply `a` by a random number and produce a different result.

DONE.
