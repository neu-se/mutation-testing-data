  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function expects an array as its second argument, but `1` is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function expects an array as its second argument, but `"foo"` is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function expects an array as its second argument, but `null` is not an array.

DONE.
