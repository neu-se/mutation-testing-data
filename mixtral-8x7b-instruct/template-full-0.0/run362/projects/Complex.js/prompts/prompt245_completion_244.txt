 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `exp` method would return a `Complex` object with `0` as the imaginary part, regardless of the original value of `this['im']`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `exp` method would return a `Complex` object with the real part duplicated, instead of using the original value of `this['im']` for the imaginary part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `exp` method would return a `Complex` object with a random value as the imaginary part, instead of using the original value of `this['im']`.

DONE.
