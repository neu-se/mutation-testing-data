 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Promise(resolve => resolve(promise))
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new promise that resolves immediately with the `promise` argument, instead of using `when` to handle the promise's state. This could cause issues if the original `when` function was responsible for handling promise rejections or progress notifications.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
promise, function(){}, function(){}, function(){};
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses empty functions for the `onRejected` and `onProgress` callbacks, instead of the original `onRejected` and `onProgress` functions. This could cause issues if the original functions were responsible for handling promise rejections or progress notifications.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
promise, null, null;
