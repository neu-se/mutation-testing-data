  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setTimeout` function is called with a delay of 1 millisecond instead of 0, which means that the `flush` function will be called after a delay of 1 millisecond instead of immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setTimeout` function is called with a negative delay of -1 millisecond, which means that the `flush` function will be called immediately instead of after a delay.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setTimeout` function is called with a null delay, which means that the `flush` function will be called immediately instead of after a delay.

DONE.
