  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise; !!p; p = p.source.then
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the `then` method of the `source` object instead of the `source` property. This could potentially cause a different behavior in the program, depending on how the `then` method is implemented.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise; !!p; p = p.source.catch
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the `catch` method of the `source` object instead of the `source` property. This could potentially cause a different behavior in the program, depending on how the `catch` method is implemented.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise; !!p; p = p.source.finally
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the `finally` method of the `source` object instead of the `source`
