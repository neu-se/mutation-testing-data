  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream()
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextStream` is a function that returns a stream, but `nextStream()` would call the function and return the result of the function, which is not a stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(true, function(abortErr) {
  // TODO: what do we do with the abortErr?
  cb(err)
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `read` function with the `abortErr` argument, which is not the same as the `err` argument that is passed to the `nextChunk` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read(null, function (err, data) {
  if (err) {
    if (err === true) read(true, function(abortErr) {
      // TODO: what do we do with the abortErr?
      cb(err)
