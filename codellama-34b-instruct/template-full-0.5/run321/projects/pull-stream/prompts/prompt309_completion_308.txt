  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `test(data)` would always return `true`, even if `data` is not a valid input, whereas `!test(data)` would return `false` if `data` is not a valid input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test(data) && data
```
This would result in different behavior because `!test(data) && data` would return `false` if `data` is not a valid input, whereas `!test(data)` would return `true` if `data` is not a valid input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data) || data
```
This would result in different behavior because `test(data) || data` would return `true` if `data` is not a valid input, whereas `!test(data)` would return `false` if `data` is not a valid input.

DONE.
