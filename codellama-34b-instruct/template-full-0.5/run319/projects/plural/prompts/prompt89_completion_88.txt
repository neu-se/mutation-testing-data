  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'person', 'peoples'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pluralizes "person" to "people", while the new code fragment pluralizes "person" to "peoples".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'person', 'persons'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pluralizes "person" to "people", while the new code fragment pluralizes "person" to "persons".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'person', 'individuals'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pluralizes "person" to "people", while the new code fragment pluralizes "person" to "individuals".

DONE.
