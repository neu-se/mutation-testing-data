 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
onFulfilled.bind(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the context of the `onFulfilled` function, potentially causing issues if the function relies on the `this` keyword.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { onFulfilled(this); }
