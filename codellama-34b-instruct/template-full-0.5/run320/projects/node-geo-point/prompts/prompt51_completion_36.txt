  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.latitude - point1.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the distance between the two points in the latitude direction, rather than the longitude direction.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude - point1.longitude + 360
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 360 degrees to the result of the subtraction, effectively wrapping the result around the globe.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude - point1.longitude - 360
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 360 degrees from the result of the subtraction, effectively wrapping the result around the globe in the opposite direction.

DONE.
