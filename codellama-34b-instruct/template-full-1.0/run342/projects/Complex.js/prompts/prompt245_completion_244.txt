  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['foo']
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['foo']` is undefined, while `this['im']` is a valid property of the `Complex` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10 * this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because `10 * this['im']` would be evaluated as 10 times the value of the `im` property of the `Complex` object, while `this['im']` is the actual value of the `im` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im/2']
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['im/2']` would be evaluated as the value of the `im/2` property of the `Complex` object, which is undefined, while `this['im']` is a valid property.

DONE.
