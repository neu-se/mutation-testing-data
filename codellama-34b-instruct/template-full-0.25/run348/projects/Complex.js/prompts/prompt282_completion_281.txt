  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `b` directly, while the new code fragment uses the negative of `b`. This could cause the calculation of the complex number's magnitude to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `b` directly, while the new code fragment uses `b + 1`. This could cause the calculation of the complex number's magnitude to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `b` directly, while the new code fragment uses `b * 2`. This could cause the calculation of the complex number's magnitude to be incorrect.

DONE.
