  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` instead of `resolve` would change the outcome of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `notify` instead of `resolve` would call the notification callbacks instead of fulfilling the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.not_a_function
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a runtime error as `not_a_function` is not a defined function on `deferred`.

DONE.
