  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had `this._writeStream.uncork()` without any arguments, which means it would uncork the write stream without any specific buffer. However, by passing `null` as an argument, it would uncork the write stream with a null buffer, which could cause the write stream to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork(this._queue.size);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had `this._writeStream.uncork()` without any arguments, which means it would uncork the write stream without any specific buffer. However, by passing `this._queue.size` as an argument, it would uncork the write stream with a buffer that is the size of the queue, which could cause the write stream to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._write
