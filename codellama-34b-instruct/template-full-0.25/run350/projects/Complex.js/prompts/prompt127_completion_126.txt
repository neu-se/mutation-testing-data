  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>) || z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is not defined on the `Complex` object, so it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is not defined on the `Complex` object, so it would throw an error.

DONE.
