  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('criterion', 'criterias')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the plural form of "criterion" as "criteria", whereas this code fragment adds it as "criterias".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('criterion', 'criterion')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the plural form of "criterion" as "criteria", whereas this code fragment adds it as "criterion".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('criterion', 'criterionz')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the plural form of "criterion" as "criteria", whereas this code fragment adds it as "criterionz".

DONE.
