  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!timezone.aliasOf
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `aliasOf` property of the `timezone` object is falsy, rather than the `timezone` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone.aliasOf === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `aliasOf` property of the `timezone` object is equal to `null`, rather than checking if the `timezone` object is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone.aliasOf === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `aliasOf` property of the `timezone` object is equal to `undefined`, rather than checking if the `timezone` object is falsy.

DONE.
