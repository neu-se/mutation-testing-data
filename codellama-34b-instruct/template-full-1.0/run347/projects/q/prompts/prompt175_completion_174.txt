  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.reverse().join
```
This would result in different behavior because `reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in the array, which would lead to a different stack trace when the `join` method is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.sort().join
```
This would result in different behavior because `sort()` sorts the elements in the array, which would lead to a different stack trace when the `join` method is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.filter(line => line.indexOf('qName') === -1).join
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` removes any lines that contain the string 'qName', which would lead to a different stack trace when the `join` method is called.

DONE.
