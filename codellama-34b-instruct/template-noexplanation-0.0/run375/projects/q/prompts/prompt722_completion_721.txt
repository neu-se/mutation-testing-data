  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().state === "rejected"
```
This code fragment checks if the promise is rejected, which is the opposite of the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().state === "pending"
```
This code fragment checks if the promise is pending, which is different from the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().state === "fulfilled" && promise.inspect().value === undefined
```
This code fragment checks if the promise is fulfilled and the value is undefined, which is different from the original code fragment.

DONE.
