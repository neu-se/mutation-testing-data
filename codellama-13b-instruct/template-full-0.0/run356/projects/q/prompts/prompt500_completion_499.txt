  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.apply(this, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is used to call the function with the specified `this` value and arguments, whereas the original code uses the `apply` method without the `this` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.call(this, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method is used to call the function with the specified `this` value and arguments, whereas the original code uses the `apply` method without the `this` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.bind(this, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method is used to create a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the specified value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the function is called. The original code uses the `apply` method without the `this` value.
