  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fapply(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fapply` expects a context object as the first argument, whereas `fcall` does not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fbind(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fbind` creates a new bound function, whereas `fcall` calls the function immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fapply(null, [value])
```
This would result in different behavior because `fapply` expects an array of arguments, whereas `fcall` expects a list of arguments.

DONE.
