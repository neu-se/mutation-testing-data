  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.push(newOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushes the newOp onto the end of the ops array, while this code fragment pushes the newOp onto the beginning of the ops array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.unshift(newOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushes the newOp onto the end of the ops array, while this code fragment pushes the newOp onto the beginning of the ops array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(0, 0, newOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushes the newOp onto the end of the ops array, while this code fragment pushes the newOp onto the beginning of the ops array.

DONE.
