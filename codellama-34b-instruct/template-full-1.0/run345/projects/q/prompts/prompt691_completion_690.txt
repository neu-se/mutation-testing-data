  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [undefined, array_slice(arguments)]
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `void 0`, and could potentially cause errors in the application.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [null, array_slice(arguments)]
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not the same as `void 0`, and could potentially cause errors in the application.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [0, array_slice(arguments)]
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is not the same as `void 0`, and could potentially cause errors in the application.

DONE.
