 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds the item to the beginning of the array, rather than the end like `push`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` returns a new array with the item added, rather than modifying the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.splice(0, 0, item)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` modifies the original array by inserting the item at the beginning, rather than adding it to the end.

DONE.
