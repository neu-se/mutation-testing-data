 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === 0 && this['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for explicit equality of the real and imaginary parts to zero, instead of invoking the `isZero` method which might contain additional checks or logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(this).every(val => val === 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if all values of the complex number are zero, without considering the special cases or edge cases that the `isZero` method might handle.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.isInfinite()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the complex number is infinite, which is not the same as checking if it is zero.

DONE.
