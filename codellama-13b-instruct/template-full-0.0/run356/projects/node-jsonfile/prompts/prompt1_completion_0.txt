  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator is removed, which would cause the code to throw a `ReferenceError` if `options` is not a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator is removed, which would cause the code to throw a `ReferenceError` if `options` is not a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.toString() === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator is removed, which would cause the code to throw a `ReferenceError` if `options` is not a string.

DONE.
