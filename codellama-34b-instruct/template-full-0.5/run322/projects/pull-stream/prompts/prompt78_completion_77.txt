  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
loop = false
```
This would result in different behavior because `loop` is set to `false` in the original code, but if it is set to `true` in the mutated code, the loop will continue to execute indefinitely, causing the function to hang.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbed = true
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbed` is set to `false` in the original code, but if it is set to `true` in the mutated code, the loop will exit prematurely, causing the function to return an incorrect value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read = null
```
This would result in different behavior because `read` is a required parameter in the original code, but if it is set to `null` in the mutated code, the function will throw a `TypeError` when it tries to call `read()`.

DONE.
