 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
baseUrlStr = baseUrlStr.slice(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the first character of the `baseUrlStr` instead of removing the fragment starting with '#'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
baseUrlStr = baseUrlStr.replace(/#.*/, '');
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `replace` method with a regular expression, which is the original behavior, but with a different regular expression that only removes the fragment starting with '#'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
baseUrlStr = '';
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the `baseUrlStr` to an empty string, which would affect the parsing of the URLs in the rest of the function.

DONE.
