Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return "progress"; }
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of passing the actual progress value to the callback, it always returns the string "progress", which does not reflect the actual progress of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it effectively removes the progress notification functionality, meaning that no progress updates will be sent to the callback, which could lead to a lack of feedback in scenarios where progress tracking is important.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return null; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes `null` to the progress callback instead of the actual progress value, which could mislead the consumer of the promise into thinking that no progress has been made when, in fact, it has.

DONE.
