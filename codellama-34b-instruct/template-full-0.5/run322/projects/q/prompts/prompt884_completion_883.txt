  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with the `this` context bound to the first argument, which in this case is `this`. This means that the `fapply` method will be called on a different object than the original code, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` calls a function with a given `this` context and arguments. In this case, the `this` context is set to `null`, which means that the `fapply` method will be called on the global object, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply.apply(null, [])
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` calls a function with a given `this` context and an array of arguments
