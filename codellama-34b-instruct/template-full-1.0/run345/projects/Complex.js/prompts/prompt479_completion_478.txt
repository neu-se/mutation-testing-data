  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['re']` refers to the real part of the complex number, whereas `this['im']` refers to the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because `-this['im']` is the negative of the imaginary part of the complex number, whereas `this['im']` is the positive of the imaginary part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['im'] + 1` is one greater than the imaginary part of the complex number, whereas `this['im']` is the imaginary part itself.

DONE.
