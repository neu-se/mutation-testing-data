  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for inequality, while the `===` operator checks for equality. In this case, the `atReport` variable is being checked for equality with `-1`, which would result in a different outcome if the variable were to contain a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `>` operator checks for greater than, while the `===` operator checks for equality. In this case, the `atReport` variable is being checked for greater than `-1`, which would result in a different outcome if the variable were to contain a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport < -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<` operator checks for less than, while the `===` operator checks for equality. In this case, the `atReport` variable is being checked for less than
