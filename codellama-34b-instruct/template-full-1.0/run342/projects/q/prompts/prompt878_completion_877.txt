  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
varArgs.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `varArgs` is an undefined variable, whereas `nodeArgs` is a defined variable that refers to an array of arguments passed to the `setTimeout` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newArgs.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `newArgs` is an undefined variable, whereas `nodeArgs` is a defined variable that refers to an array of arguments passed to the `setTimeout` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because `[]` is an empty array, whereas `nodeArgs` is a non-empty array that contains the arguments passed to the `setTimeout` function.

DONE.
