 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { read(abort, cb) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` argument passed to the inner `read` function would always be `true`, even when it's called during normal operation (not in the `abort` branch).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the current stream to be aborted instead of continuing to read from it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the callback directly, instead of passing the `abort` argument to the `read` function.

DONE.
