  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.charAt
```
This would result in a different behavior because `charAt` returns a specific character in the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.indexOf
```
This would result in a different behavior because `indexOf` returns the index of the first occurrence of the passed pattern in the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.lastIndexOf
```
This would result in a different behavior because `lastIndexOf` returns the index of the last occurrence of the passed pattern in the string.

DONE.
