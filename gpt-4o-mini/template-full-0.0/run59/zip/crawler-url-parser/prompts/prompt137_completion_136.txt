Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'//'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the path to a double slash, which is not a valid path representation and could lead to incorrect URL resolution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/index.html'
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends a specific file name to the path, which could alter the way the URL is interpreted, potentially leading to a mismatch in expected URL structure.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/default.html'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the path to a specific file, which may not exist in the context of the original URL, leading to incorrect URL handling or resolution.

DONE.
