  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because when the `reduce` method is called on the `b` object, `a` would be the accumulator, and `b` would be the current value. This means that the `a` object would be altered by the `reduce` method, whereas the original code fragment did not alter the `a` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because when the `reduce` method is called on the `b` object, `null` would be the accumulator, and `b` would be the current value. This means that the resulting object would have the same keys as `b`, but the values would all be `null`, whereas the original code fragment resulted in an object with the same keys as `b` and the values would be the values of `a` where they differ from those of `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result
