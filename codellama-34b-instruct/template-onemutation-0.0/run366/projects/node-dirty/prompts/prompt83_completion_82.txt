  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` returns the first index of the specified value, while `lastIndexOf` returns the last index of the specified value. In the context of the code, `lastIndexOf` is used to find the last newline character in the buffer, while `indexOf` would find the first newline character. If the buffer contains multiple lines, using `indexOf` instead of `lastIndexOf` would cause the code to only process the first line.
