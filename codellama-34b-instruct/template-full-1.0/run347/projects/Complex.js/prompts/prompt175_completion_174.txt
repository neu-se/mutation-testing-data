  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c < d
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always be true when c and d have different signs, while the original code would only be true when the absolute value of c is less than the absolute value of d.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c > d
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always be true when c and d have the same sign, while the original code would only be true when the absolute value of c is less than the absolute value of d.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c != d
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always be true when c and d are not equal, while the original code would only be true when the absolute value of c is less than the absolute value of d.

DONE.
