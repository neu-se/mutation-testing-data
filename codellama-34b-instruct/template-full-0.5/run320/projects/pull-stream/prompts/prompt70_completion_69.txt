  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op && false === op(data) || abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `sink` function to return a different value than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op && false === op(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `sink` function to return a different value than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op(data) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `sink` function to return a different value than the original code fragment.

DONE.
