  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `cos` is the cosine function, which has a different range and values than `cosh`, the hyperbolic cosine function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `acos` is the inverse cosine function, which has a different range and values than `cosh`, the hyperbolic cosine function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
log
```
This would result in different behavior because `log` is the logarithmic function, which has a different range and values than `cosh`, the hyperbolic cosine function.

DONE.
