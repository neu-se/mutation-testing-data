 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => buildTimezonesMap(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new function expression, which may not have access to the same external variables or closures as the original `buildTimezonesMap` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezonesMap.bind(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new bound function, which may not have access to the same external variables or closures as the original `buildTimezonesMap` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.assign({}, buildTimezonesMap, { data })
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new object with a `data` property that references the `data` argument, rather than directly referencing the `buildTimezonesMap` function.

These changes would result in different behavior because they modify the way that the `getTimezonesMap
