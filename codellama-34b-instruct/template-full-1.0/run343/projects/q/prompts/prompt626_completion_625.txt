  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q[null]
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q[null]` is undefined, and the `set` method would not be called on the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0.123.456
```
This would result in different behavior because `0.123.456` is a syntax error, and the code would not run at all.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"set"` is a string, and it would not be treated as a method reference.

DONE.
