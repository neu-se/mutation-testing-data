  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from the second argument instead of the first, which could cause the function to skip over the first argument and not apply the transformation to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from the last argument instead of the first, which could cause the function to apply the transformation to the last argument instead of the first.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = Math.floor(Math.random() * length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from a random argument instead of the first, which could cause the function to apply the transformation to a random argument instead of the first.

DONE.
