  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`/${part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$2')}`
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is incorrect, it should be `\\$1` instead of `\\$2`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`/${part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$1')}`
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is the same as the original code, it should be different to test the mutation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`/${part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$3')}`
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is incorrect, it should be `\\$1` or `\\$2` instead of `\\$3`.

DONE.
