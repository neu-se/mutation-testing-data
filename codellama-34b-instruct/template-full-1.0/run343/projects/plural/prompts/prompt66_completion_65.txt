  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'tension'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new rule for the word "tension" instead of the intended "memo".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new rule for the word "goose" instead of the intended "memo".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'momo'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new rule for the word "momo" instead of the intended "memo".

DONE.
