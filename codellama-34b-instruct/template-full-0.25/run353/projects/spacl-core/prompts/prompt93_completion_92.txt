  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(policy.name, policy)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the policy with the same name as the current policy, effectively overwriting it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(policy.name, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the policy with the same name as the current policy to null, effectively removing it from the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(policy.name, new Policy())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the policy with the same name as the current policy to a new, empty policy, effectively replacing it.

DONE.
