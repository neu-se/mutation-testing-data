 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fs.readFile` callback receives an error as the first argument when it encounters an error, but passing `null` as the first argument would not trigger an error in the callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
file, 'bad_options'
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFile` expects an object as the second argument, but passing a string would result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
file, options, () => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFile` expects only two arguments, but passing an additional callback function would result in an error.

DONE.
