  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow()` function would be called with a base of 3 instead of 2, which would change the result of the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.5
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow()` function would be called with a base of 2.5 instead of 2, which would change the result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow()` function would be called with a base of pi (Ï€) instead of 2, which would change the result of the calculation.

DONE.
