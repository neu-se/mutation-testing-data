  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.chop(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the argument passed to the `chop` method, but the new code fragment always passes 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.chop(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the argument passed to the `chop` method, but the new code fragment always passes 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.chop(2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the argument passed to the `chop` method, but the new code fragment always passes 2.

DONE.
