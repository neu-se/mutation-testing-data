  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
ended = false
```
This would result in different behavior because `ended` is initially set to `false`, and the `ended` variable is only set to `true` inside the `if (test(data))` block. If we replace the `ended` variable with `false`, the callback will never be called with `ended` set to `true`, even if the data passes the test.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!ended
```
This would result in different behavior because `!ended` is the logical negation of `ended`. If `ended` is `true`, `!ended` will be `false`, which means the callback will never be called with `ended` set to `true`, even if the data passes the test.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `test(data)` is a function call, and it may have a different return value than the `ended` variable.
