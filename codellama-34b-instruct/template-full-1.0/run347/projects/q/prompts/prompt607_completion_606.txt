  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `op` is a string, and `op + 1` would result in a concatenation of `op` and the string "1", which is likely not the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `op` is a string, and `op * 2` would result in a concatenation of `op` and the string "2", which is likely not the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `op` is a string, and `toUpperCase()` would return a new string with all characters in uppercase, which is likely not the desired behavior.

DONE.
