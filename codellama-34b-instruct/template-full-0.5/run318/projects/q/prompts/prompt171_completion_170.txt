  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNodeFrame || isInternalFrame
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNodeFrame` would always be true, and `isInternalFrame` would always be false, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNodeFrame && isInternalFrame
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNodeFrame` and `isInternalFrame` would both be false, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNodeFrame ^ isInternalFrame
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNodeFrame` and `isInternalFrame` would have different values, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to different values.

DONE.
