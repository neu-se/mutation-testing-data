  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.send` would always return a promise for an empty array, regardless of the actual arguments passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_concat(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.send` would always return a promise for an array containing all the arguments passed to the function, even if the first argument was not a promise or an immediate value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_length(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.send` would always return a promise for an array containing a single element, regardless of the actual arguments passed to the function.

DONE.
