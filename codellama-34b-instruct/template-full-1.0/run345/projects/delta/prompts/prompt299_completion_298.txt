  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `concat` function to return an empty delta object, regardless of the content of the `other` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `concat` function to return a delta object with the concatenation of `this.ops` and `other.ops`, but the resulting delta object would have the same length as the `other` object, not as the `this` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `concat` function to return a delta object with the concatenation of `this.ops` and `other.ops`, but the resulting delta object would have the same length as the `this` object, not as the `other` object.

DONE.
