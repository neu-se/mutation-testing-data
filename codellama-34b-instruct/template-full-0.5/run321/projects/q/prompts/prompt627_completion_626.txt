  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` operator is used to remove a property from an object, whereas the `set` operator is used to set the value of a property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` operator is used to retrieve the value of a property, whereas the `set` operator is used to set the value of a property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` operator is used to post a message to a value in a future turn, whereas the `set` operator is used to set the value of a property.

DONE.
