  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `test` function, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if the `test` function returns a truthy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data) && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than the `!` operator, so the `test` function would be called with the `data` argument, and the result would be `false` regardless of the return value of the `test` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data) || false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has a higher precedence than the `!` operator, so the `test` function would be called with the `data` argument, and the result would be `true` if the return value of the `test
