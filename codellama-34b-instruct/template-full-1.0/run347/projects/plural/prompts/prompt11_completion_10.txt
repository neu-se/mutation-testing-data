  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'oes' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds "ies" to the word, while this new fragment adds "oes" instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'x' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds "ies" to the word, while this new fragment adds "x" instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'yz' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds "ies" to the word, while this new fragment adds "yz" instead.

DONE.
