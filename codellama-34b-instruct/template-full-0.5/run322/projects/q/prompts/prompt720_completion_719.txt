  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would be called immediately, causing the promise to be rejected, even if the promise is not yet settled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would be called immediately, causing the promise to be resolved, even if the promise is not yet settled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` would be called immediately, causing the promise to be notified, even if the promise is not yet settled.

DONE.
