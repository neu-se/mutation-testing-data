  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return undefined, even if the promise was fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return null, even if the promise was fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to throw an error, even if the promise was fulfilled.

DONE.
