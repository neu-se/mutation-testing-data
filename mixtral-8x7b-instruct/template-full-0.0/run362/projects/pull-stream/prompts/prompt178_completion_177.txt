 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return null; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would always return null instead of the abort callback, potentially causing issues in the continuation of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb
