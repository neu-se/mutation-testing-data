  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the variable `a` instead of `b`, which could cause a bug if `a` has a different value than `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `b`, which could cause a bug if the result is not expected to be greater than the original value of `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the value of `b`, which could cause a bug if the result is not expected to be twice the original value of `b`.

DONE.
