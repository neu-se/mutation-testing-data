  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rule[1]` property is a function that returns the plural form of a word, whereas `rule[0]` is a regular expression that matches the singular form of a word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].test(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule[0].test(word)` is a boolean value that indicates whether the regular expression `rule[0]` matches the word `word`, whereas `rule[1]` is a function that returns the plural form of a word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.match(rule[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because `word.match(rule[0])` is a string that contains the portion of the word `word` that matches the regular expression `rule[0]`, whereas `rule[1]` is a function that returns the plural form of a word.
