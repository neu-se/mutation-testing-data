  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise, whereas `deferred.reject` would reject it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` would notify the promise, whereas `deferred.reject` would reject it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.done
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.done` would check if the promise is resolved, whereas `deferred.reject` would reject it.

DONE.
