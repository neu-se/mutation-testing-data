  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb in this.verbs.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.verbs.keys()` returns an iterator over the keys of the `verbs` object, whereas `this.verbs` returns the object itself. This means that the original code fragment would iterate over the keys of the `verbs` object, whereas the modified code fragment would iterate over the values of the `verbs` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb in this.verbs.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.verbs.values()` returns an iterator over the values of the `verbs` object, whereas `this.verbs` returns the object itself. This means that the original code fragment would iterate over the keys of the `verbs` object, whereas the modified code fragment would iterate over the values of the `verbs` object.
