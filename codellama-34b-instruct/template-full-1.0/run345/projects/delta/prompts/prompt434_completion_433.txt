  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would peek at the previous op instead of the current op.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would peek at the next op instead of the current op.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[Math.floor(Math.random() * this.ops.length)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would peek at a random op instead of the current op.

DONE.
