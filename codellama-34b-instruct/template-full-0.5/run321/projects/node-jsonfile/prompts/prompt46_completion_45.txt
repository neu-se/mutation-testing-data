  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFile
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFile` is a function that takes a callback as its last argument, whereas `fs.writeFileSync` is a function that returns a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync(file, str, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFileSync` is a function that returns a promise, whereas `fs.writeFile` is a function that takes a callback as its last argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFile(file, str, options, () => {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFile` takes a callback as its last argument, whereas `fs.writeFileSync` returns a promise.

DONE.
