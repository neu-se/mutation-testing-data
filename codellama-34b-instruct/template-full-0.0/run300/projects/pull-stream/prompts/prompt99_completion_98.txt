  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err === false ? null : err
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `null` if `err` is `false`, instead of returning `err` as the original code does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err ? null : err
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `null` if `err` is truthy, instead of returning `err` as the original code does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err ? err : null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `err` if it is truthy, instead of returning `null` as the original code does.

DONE.
