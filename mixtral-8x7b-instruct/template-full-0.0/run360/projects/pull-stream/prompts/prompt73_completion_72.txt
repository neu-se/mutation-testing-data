 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the value of `this` within the `read` function, potentially causing issues if the `read` function relies on the value of `this` to access other parts of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(read || null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it could cause a `TypeError` if the `read` function is called and its value is `null`. This would expose a potential issue with the error handling in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return read }
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps the `read` function in an anonymous function, which would prevent it from being called directly. This could expose a potential issue with how the `read` function is being used in the code.

DONE.
