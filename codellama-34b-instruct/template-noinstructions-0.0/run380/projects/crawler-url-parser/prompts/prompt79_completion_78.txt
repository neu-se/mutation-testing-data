  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is selecting all anchor tags, while the new code fragment is selecting all anchor tags with the class "a".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'a[href]'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is selecting all anchor tags, while the new code fragment is selecting all anchor tags with an href attribute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'a[href="http://example.com"]'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is selecting all anchor tags, while the new code fragment is selecting all anchor tags with an href attribute that matches the specified URL.

DONE.
