  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + 1
```
This change will cause the `drain` function to always return `true` for the `op` variable, which may cause the function to behave differently than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op - 1
```
This change will cause the `drain` function to always return `false` for the `op` variable, which may cause the function to behave differently than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op * 2
```
This change will cause the `drain` function to always return twice the value of `op`, which may cause the function to behave differently than intended.

DONE.
