  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.sink
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sink` property is not always defined on the `s` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.source
```
This would result in different behavior because the `source` property is not always defined on the `s` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.sink()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sink` property is not always a function.

DONE.
