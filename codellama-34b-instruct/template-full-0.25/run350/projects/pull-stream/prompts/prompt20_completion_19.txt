  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the `pull` function is now `ref[1]` instead of `ref[0]`, which could cause the function to behave differently when called with different arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument of the `pull` function is now `ref[1]` instead of `ref[0]`, which could cause the function to behave differently when called with different arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the fourth argument of the `pull` function is now `ref[2]` instead of `ref[0]`, which could cause the function to behave differently when called with different arguments.

DONE.
