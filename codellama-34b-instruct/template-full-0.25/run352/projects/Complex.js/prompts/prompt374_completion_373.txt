  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the square of the real part of the complex number, instead of the square of the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the square of the sum of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, instead of the square of the imaginary part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (a - b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the square of the difference of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, instead of the square of the imaginary part.

DONE.
