  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.access(src, fs.constants.R_OK | fs.constants.W_OK);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checked for read access, while this new code fragment checks for both read and write access.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.access(src, fs.constants.R_OK | fs.constants.X_OK);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checked for read access, while this new code fragment checks for both read and execute access.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.access(src, fs.constants.R_OK | fs.constants.F_OK);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checked for read access, while this new code fragment checks for both read and existence of the file.

DONE.
