  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFile
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFile` is a function that reads a file asynchronously, whereas `fs.readFileSync` is a function that reads a file synchronously. Using `fs.readFile` in the `readFileSync` function would cause the function to return a promise instead of the expected file content, which would result in unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.readFile
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.readFile` is a function that wraps `fs.readFile` and provides a consistent interface for reading files both asynchronously and synchronously. Using `universalify.readFile` in the `readFileSync` function would cause the function to return a promise instead of the expected file content, which would result in unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior
