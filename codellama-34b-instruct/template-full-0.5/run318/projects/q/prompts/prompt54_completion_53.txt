  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.nextTick
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.nextTick` is a function that schedules a task to be executed after the current event loop, while `process.toString` is a function that returns a string representation of the `process` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.exit
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.exit` is a function that terminates the process, while `process.toString` is a function that returns a string representation of the `process` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.cwd
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.cwd` is a function that returns the current working directory of the process, while `process.toString` is a function that returns a string representation of the `process` object.

DONE.
