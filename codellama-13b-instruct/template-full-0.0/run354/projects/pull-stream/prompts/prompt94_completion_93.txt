  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would not be called with the expected arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called with the expected arguments, but the `data` argument would be `null`, which could cause issues in the rest of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called with the expected arguments, but the `data` argument would be `true`, which could cause issues in the rest of the code.

DONE.
