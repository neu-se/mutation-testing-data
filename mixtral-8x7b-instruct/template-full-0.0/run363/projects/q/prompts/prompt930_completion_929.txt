 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `this` would not be passed to `Q.denodeify.apply()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
window
```
This would result in different behavior because if the code is running in a browser environment, `window` would be passed as the `this` value instead of the current object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
123
```
This would result in different behavior because a number would be passed as the `this` value, which could cause unexpected results in the `Q.denodeify.apply()` function.

DONE.
