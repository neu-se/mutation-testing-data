Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.push
```
This would result in different behavior because using `push` would add the stack trace to the end of the `stacks` array instead of the beginning, resulting in the order of stack traces being reversed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.unshift(promise.source)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to unshift the `source` property of the `promise` object instead of its `stack`, which may lead to an incorrect or undefined value being added to the `stacks` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.splice(0, 0, p.stack)
```
This would result in different behavior because using `splice` in this way is functionally similar to `unshift`, but it introduces unnecessary complexity and could lead to confusion or errors if the parameters are not correctly understood, potentially affecting performance or readability.

DONE.
