  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to enter the `if` block even if `op.insert` is `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to enter the `if` block even if `op.insert` is `null` or `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to enter the `if` block even if `op.insert` is `null`.

DONE.
