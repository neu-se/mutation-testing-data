  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `replace` method to remove the last part of the URL path, while this new code fragment uses a regular expression to match and replace the last part of the URL path with an empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.split("/").pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `replace` method to remove the last part of the URL path, while this new code fragment uses the `split` method to split the URL path into an array of substrings and then uses the `pop` method to remove the last substring from the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.substring(0, linkurl_path.lastIndexOf("/"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the
