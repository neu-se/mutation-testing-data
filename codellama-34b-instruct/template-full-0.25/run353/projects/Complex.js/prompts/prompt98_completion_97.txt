  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] === 'j' || tokens[i + 1] === 'J'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is now checking for the letter "j" or "J" instead of "i" or "I".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] !== 'i' && tokens[i + 1] !== 'I'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is now checking for the opposite condition (i.e., the next token is not "i" or "I").

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] === 'i' || tokens[i + 1] === 'I' || tokens[i + 1] === 'j' || tokens[i + 1] === 'J'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is now checking for the letter "j" or "J"
