Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain - firstLeft < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition from checking if there is remaining retain length to checking if the remaining length is negative, which could lead to skipping the next operation incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain === firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check for equality instead of greater than, which may cause the code to execute the next operation even when there is still retain length available.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstLeft === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the remaining length is exactly zero, which could lead to incorrect handling of the next operation if there is still some retain length left.

DONE.
