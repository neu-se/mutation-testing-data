  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection" + "abc"
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name would be "unhandledRejectionabc" instead of "unhandledRejection".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection" + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name would be "unhandledRejection1" instead of "unhandledRejection".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection" + "xyz"
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name would be "unhandledRejectionxyz" instead of "unhandledRejection".

DONE.
