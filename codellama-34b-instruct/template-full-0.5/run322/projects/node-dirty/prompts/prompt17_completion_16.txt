  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, val);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `this._queue.set(key, cbs)` sets a value in the queue map, while this new code fragment sets a value in the data map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, cbs);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `this._data.set(key, val)` sets a value in the data map, while this new code fragment sets a value in the queue map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, []);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `this._queue.set(key, cbs)` sets a value in the queue map, while this new code fragment sets an empty array as the value in the queue map.

DONE.
