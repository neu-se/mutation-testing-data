  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, which would cause the `fromLngLatArray` method to interpret the coordinates in the wrong order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method returns a new array with the elements from the original array, starting from the specified index. In this case, it would return a new array with the second element of the original array, which would cause the `fromLngLatArray` method to interpret the coordinates in the wrong order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.concat([0])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat()` method returns a new array with the elements of the original array, followed by the elements of the specified array. In this case, it would return a new array with the
