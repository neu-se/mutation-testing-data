 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
rules.push([match, result])
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of rules will be reversed, potentially changing the output of the `plural` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
rules = [match, result]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rules` array will be overwritten, removing all previously added rules.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
rules.unshift([match, result, plural])
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument `plural` is being passed to `rules.unshift()`, which is not expected by the function and will cause an error.

DONE.
