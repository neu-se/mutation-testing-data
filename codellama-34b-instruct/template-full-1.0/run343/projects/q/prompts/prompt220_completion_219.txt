  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(typeof process === "object" && process && process.env && process.env.Q_DEBUG)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the boolean value of the expression, causing the long stack traces to be disabled even if the `Q_DEBUG` environment variable is set.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process !== "object" || !process || !process.env || !process.env.Q_DEBUG
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression would be checking for the opposite condition (i.e., if `typeof process` is not an object or any of the other properties are falsy), causing the long stack traces to be disabled even if the `Q_DEBUG` environment variable is set.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process === "object" && process && process.env && process.env.Q_DEBUG_
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression would be checking
