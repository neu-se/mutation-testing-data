  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises, Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.reject` function would be called instead of the `Q` function, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises, Q.defer
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.defer` function would be called instead of the `Q` function, which would cause the promise to be deferred instead of resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises, Q.all
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.all` function would be called instead of the `Q` function, which would cause the promise to be resolved with an array of promises instead of a single promise.

DONE.
