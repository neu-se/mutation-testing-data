  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('/^(?:woman|person)$/i', function(w) { return w })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/^(?:woman|person)$/i` would match the words "woman" and "person", but the function would return the original word instead of its plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/^[aeiouy]r$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/^[aeiouy]r$/i` would match words that end in "er" but not in "or", but the function would return the original word with "s" added instead of its plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/^[aeiouy]r$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' })
```
