  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `.bind(null)` would change the value of `this` inside the `notify` function, which might be relied upon in the rest of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify.apply(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `.apply(undefined)` would change the context in which `notify` is called, which might be relied upon in the rest of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `.call(null)` would change the context in which `notify` is called, which might be relied upon in the rest of the code.

DONE.
