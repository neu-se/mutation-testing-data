  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call with two arguments, while the buggy code fragment is a function call with only one argument. This would cause the code to throw an error when it is executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, cb, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call with two arguments, while the buggy code fragment is a function call with three arguments. This would cause the code to throw an error when it is executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, cb, true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call with two arguments, while the buggy code fragment is a function call with three arguments. This would cause the code to throw an error when it is executed.

DONE.
