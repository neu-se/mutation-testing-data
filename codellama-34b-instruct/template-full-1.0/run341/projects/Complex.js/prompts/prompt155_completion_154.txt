  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(this['isZero']() || z['isZero']()) && (this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if both `this` and `z` are zero or infinite, while the mutated code checks if either of them is zero or infinite. This would cause the function to produce different output in certain edge cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(this['isZero']() || z['isZero']()) || (this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if either of `this` or `z` is zero or infinite, while the mutated code checks if both of them are zero or infinite. This would cause the function to produce different output in certain edge cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(this['isZero']() && z['isZero']()) &&
