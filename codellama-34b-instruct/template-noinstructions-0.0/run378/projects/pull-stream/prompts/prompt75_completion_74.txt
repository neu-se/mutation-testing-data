  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done || function () { throw new Error('aborted') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would call the `done` callback with no arguments if it was provided, while the new code fragment would throw an error if `done` was not provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done || function () { return }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would call the `done` callback with no arguments if it was provided, while the new code fragment would return without calling the `done` callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done || function () { return 'aborted' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would call the `done` callback with no arguments if it was provided, while the new code fragment would return the string 'aborted' without calling the `done` callback.

DONE.
