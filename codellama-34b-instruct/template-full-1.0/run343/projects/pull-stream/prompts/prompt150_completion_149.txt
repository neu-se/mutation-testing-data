  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because `!abort` negates the boolean value of `abort`, which means the `if` statement would always be executed, regardless of the value of `abort`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && onAbort()
```
This would result in different behavior because `abort && onAbort()` short-circuits the evaluation of `onAbort()` if `abort` is false, which means the `if` statement would never be executed if `abort` is false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || onAbort()
```
This would result in different behavior because `abort || onAbort()` short-circuits the evaluation of `onAbort()` if `abort` is true, which means the `if` statement would always be executed if `abort` is true.

DONE.
