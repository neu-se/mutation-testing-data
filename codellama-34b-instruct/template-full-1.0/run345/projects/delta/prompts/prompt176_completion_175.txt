  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let opLength = Math.min(otherIter.peekLength(), length);
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a different variable name for the minumum of the two lengths.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let opLength = Math.max(otherIter.peekLength(), length);
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a different operator to calculate the minimum of the two lengths.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let opLength = Math.abs(otherIter.peekLength()) - length;
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a different arithmetic operation to calculate the minimum of the two lengths.

DONE.
