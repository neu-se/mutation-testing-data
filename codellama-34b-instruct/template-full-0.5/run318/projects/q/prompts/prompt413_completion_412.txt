  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isString
```
This would result in different behavior because `isString` is a different function that checks if a value is a string, whereas `isObject` checks if a value is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNumber
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNumber` is a different function that checks if a value is a number, whereas `isObject` checks if a value is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isArray
```
This would result in different behavior because `isArray` is a different function that checks if a value is an array, whereas `isObject` checks if a value is an object.

DONE.
