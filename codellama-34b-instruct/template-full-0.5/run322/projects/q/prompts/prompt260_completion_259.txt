  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!value
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator flips the boolean value of `value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the value of `value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the value of `value` by 2.

DONE.
