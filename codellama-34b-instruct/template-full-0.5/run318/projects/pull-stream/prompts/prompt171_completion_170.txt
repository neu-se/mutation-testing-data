  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned `true` when the array was empty, but the new code fragment returns `false`. This could cause the function to return incorrect results in certain cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned `true` when the array was empty, but the new code fragment returns `null`. This could cause the function to return incorrect results in certain cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned `true` when the array was empty, but the new code fragment returns the length of the array. This could cause the function to return incorrect results in certain cases.

DONE.
