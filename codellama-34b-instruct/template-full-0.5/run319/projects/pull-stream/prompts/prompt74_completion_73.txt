  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression would evaluate to `true` if `abort` is truthy, and `false` otherwise. In the original code, the expression would evaluate to `true` if `abort` is falsy, and `false` otherwise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `abort`, so the expression would evaluate to `true` if `abort` is falsy, and `false` otherwise. In the original code, the expression would evaluate to `true` if `abort` is truthy, and `false` otherwise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort == true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `==` operator checks for equality, and the expression would evaluate
