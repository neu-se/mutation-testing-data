  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete(key);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` method would remove the key from the map, whereas the original code fragment would set the value associated with the key to `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, val + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would set the value associated with the key to `val + 1`, whereas the original code fragment would set the value to `val`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, val * 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would set the value associated with the key to `val * 2`, whereas the original code fragment would set the value to `val`.

DONE.
