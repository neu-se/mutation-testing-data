  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).done(function () {
    throw new Error("Simulated error");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would simulate an error being thrown by the `done` method, which would cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).done(function () {
    return Q.reject("Simulated error");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would simulate an error being returned by the `done` method, which would cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).done(function () {
    return Q.resolve("Simulated success");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would simulate a successful resolution of the promise, which would cause the promise to be fulfilled.

DONE.
