  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones, options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `timezones` object instead of the `timezones` object filtered by the `deprecated` option.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones, { deprecated: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `timezones` object filtered by the `deprecated` option set to `true`, instead of the `timezones` object filtered by the `deprecated` option set to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones, { deprecated: false }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `timezones` object filtered by the `deprecated` option set to `false`, instead of the `timezones` object filtered by the `deprecated` option set to `true`.

DONE.
