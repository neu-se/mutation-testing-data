  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit("unhandledRejection", reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise` argument would be missing, which could cause the `unhandledRejection` event to be emitted with the wrong arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit("rejectionHandled", reason, promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unhandledRejection` event would be emitted instead of the `rejectionHandled` event, which could cause confusion in the code that handles these events.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit("unhandledRejection", reason, promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unhandledRejection` event would be emitted with the wrong arguments, which could cause confusion in the code that handles these events.

DONE.
