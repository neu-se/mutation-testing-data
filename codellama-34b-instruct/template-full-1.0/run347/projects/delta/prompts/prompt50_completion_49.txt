  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let b = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be comparing the value of `a` with 0 instead of the value of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let b = a + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be comparing the value of `a` with `a + 1` instead of `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let b = a - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be comparing the value of `a` with `a - 1` instead of `b`.

DONE.
