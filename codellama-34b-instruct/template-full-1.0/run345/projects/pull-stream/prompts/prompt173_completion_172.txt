  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray(array)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Array.isArray()` method checks if an object is an array, but the negation operator `!` would cause the expression to return `true` if `array` is not an array, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.length` property returns the number of elements in an array, but the expression would only return `true` if `array` has a length of 0, which is different from the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof array !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator checks the type of a variable, but the expression would only return `true` if `array` is not an object, which is different from the original behavior.

DONE.
