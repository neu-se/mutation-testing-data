  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(null, null, progressed)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` callback would be called for both fulfilled and rejected promises, whereas in the original code it is only called for fulfilled promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(null, progressed)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` callback would be called for rejected promises, whereas in the original code it is only called for fulfilled promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(progressed)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` callback would be called for both fulfilled and rejected promises, whereas in the original code it is only called for fulfilled promises.

DONE.
