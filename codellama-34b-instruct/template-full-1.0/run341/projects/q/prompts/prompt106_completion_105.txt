  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at index 1 instead of 0, potentially skipping the first element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = array.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at the last index of the array instead of the first, potentially skipping over other elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = Math.floor(Math.random() * array.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at a random index in the array, potentially skipping over or repeating elements.

DONE.
