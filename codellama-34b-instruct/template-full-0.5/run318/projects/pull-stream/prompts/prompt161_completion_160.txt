  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, _value + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns the value as is, while this modified code returns the value plus one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, _value * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns the value as is, while this modified code returns the value multiplied by two.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, _value - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns the value as is, while this modified code returns the value minus one.

DONE.
