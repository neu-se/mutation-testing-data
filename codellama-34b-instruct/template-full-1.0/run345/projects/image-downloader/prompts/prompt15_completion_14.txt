  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.separate
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.join` joins all the strings into a single path string, while `path.separate` splits a path string into an array of path segments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname` returns the directory name of a path string, while `path.join` and `path.separate` return the path string itself or an array of path segments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.basename` returns the base name of a path string, while `path.dirname` and `path.separate` return the directory name or an array of path segments.

DONE.
