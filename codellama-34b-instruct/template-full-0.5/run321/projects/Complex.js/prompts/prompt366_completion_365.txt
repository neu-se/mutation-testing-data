  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a variable, while `a + 1` is an expression that adds 1 to the value of `a`. This change would cause the code to behave differently in certain situations, such as when `a` is 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a variable, while `b` is another variable that may have a different value. This change would cause the code to behave differently in certain situations, such as when `a` and `b` have different values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a variable, while `a * a` is an expression that multiplies `a` by itself. This change would cause the code to behave differently in certain situations, such as when `
