  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, !data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!data` expression would negate the `data` value, which would cause the `test(data)` check to always return `false`, even if the `data` value is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `data + 1` expression would add 1 to the `data` value, which would cause the `test(data)` check to always return `false`, even if the `data` value is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `data.length` expression would return the length of the `data` value, which would cause the `test(data)` check to always return `false`, even if the `data` value is truthy.

DONE.
