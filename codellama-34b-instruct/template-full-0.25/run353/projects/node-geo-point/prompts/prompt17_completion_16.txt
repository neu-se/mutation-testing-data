  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method would change the order of the coordinates in the array, which could cause the `fromLngLatArray()` method to return an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop()` method would remove the last element from the coordinates array, which could cause the `fromLngLatArray()` method to return an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `shift()` method would remove the first element from the coordinates array, which could cause the `fromLngLatArray()` method to return an incorrect result.

DONE.
