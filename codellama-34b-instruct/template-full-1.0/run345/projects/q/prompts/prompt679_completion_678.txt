  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call"
```
This would result in different behavior because "call" is a different method than "apply" in JavaScript, and it has different semantics for handling function arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"bind"
```
This would result in different behavior because "bind" is a different method than "apply" in JavaScript, and it has different semantics for handling function arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"arguments"
```
This would result in different behavior because "arguments" is not a method in JavaScript, and it would cause a syntax error.

DONE.
