  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index--
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to decrement the index rather than increment it, potentially causing the loop to never terminate or to execute different code blocks.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to reset the index to 0 on every iteration, potentially causing the loop to never terminate or to execute different code blocks.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (index > 0) index--
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to decrement the index only if it is greater than 0, potentially causing the loop to never terminate or to execute different code blocks.

DONE.
