Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
obj.hasOwnProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the `hasOwnProperty` method directly on the `obj` object, which may not exist or may be overridden, whereas the original code uses `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call` to ensure the method is called on the object's prototype chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
key in obj
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the key is present in the object or its prototype chain, whereas the original code checks if the key is the object's own property using `hasOwnProperty`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns `true`, effectively including all keys in the `sortedKeys` array, whereas the original code filters out keys that are not the object's own properties.

DONE.
