  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` and `reject` are opposing methods in the context of promises. `resolve` would indicate that the promise has been fulfilled and that the value passed to it should be returned, while `reject` would indicate that the promise has failed and that an error should be returned. In this case, the `become` method would be called with a rejected promise, which would result in the `promise` variable being assigned a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(deferred.promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `promise` variable to be assigned the value of the `deferred.promise` property, which is set to null in the original code. This would cause the `inspect` method to return `null` instead of an object with a `state` property set to "pending".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
