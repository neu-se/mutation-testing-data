  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would not be called with the `slashesDenoteHost` option set to `true`, which could cause incorrect parsing of URLs with a protocol-relative prefix (e.g. `//example.com`).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would be called with the `slashesDenoteHost` option set to `null`, which could cause incorrect parsing of URLs with a protocol-relative prefix (e.g. `//example.com`).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would be called with the `slashesDenoteHost` option set to `undefined`, which could cause incorrect parsing of URLs with a protocol-relative prefix (e.g. `//example.com`).

DONE.
