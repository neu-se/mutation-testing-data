  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * x
```
This code fragment is equivalent to the original code fragment, but it uses the `*` operator instead of the `^` operator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x ** 2
```
This code fragment is equivalent to the original code fragment, but it uses the `**` operator instead of the `^` operator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(x, 2)
```
This code fragment is equivalent to the original code fragment, but it uses the `Math.pow()` function instead of the `^` operator.

DONE.
