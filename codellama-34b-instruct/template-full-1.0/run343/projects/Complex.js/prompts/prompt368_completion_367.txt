  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is a different variable from `b`, and is not be used in the calculation of `sin(b)` and `cos(b)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because `-b` is the negative of `b`, and is not be used in the calculation of `sin(b)` and `cos(b)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `b / 2` is half of `b`, and is not be used in the calculation of `sin(b)` and `cos(b)`.

DONE.
