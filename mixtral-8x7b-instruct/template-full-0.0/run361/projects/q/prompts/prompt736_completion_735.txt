 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` function calls `when` with `null` as the first argument, which might not handle correctly by the `when` function and could cause unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` function calls `when` with an empty array as the first argument, which might not handle correctly by the `when` function and could cause unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` function calls `when` with a resolved promise as the first argument, which might not handle correctly by the `when` function and could cause unexpected behavior.

DONE.
