  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 = λ1 + Δλ * cos(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the destination longitude using a different formula, which would produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 = λ1 + Δλ * sin(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the destination longitude using a different formula, which would produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 = λ1 + Δλ * tan(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the destination longitude using a different formula, which would produce a different result.

DONE.
