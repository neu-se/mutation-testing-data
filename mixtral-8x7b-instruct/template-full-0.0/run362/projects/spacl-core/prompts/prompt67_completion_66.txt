 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` creates a shallow copy of the `rules` array, so any modifications to the `rules` array after this point will not affect the copied array used in the `for...of` loop. This could lead to unexpected behavior in the `query` method if the original `rules` array is modified during the execution of the loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat()` creates a new array containing the elements of the original `rules` array, so any modifications to the `rules` array after this point will not affect the copied array used in the `for...of` loop. Similar to the `slice()` method, this could lead to unexpected behavior in the `query` method if the original `rules` array is modified during the execution of the loop.
