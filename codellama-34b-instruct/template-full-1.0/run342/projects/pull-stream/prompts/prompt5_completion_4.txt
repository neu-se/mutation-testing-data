  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throughs
```
This would result in different behavior because "throughs" is a different variable name than "throughs" and would not refer to the same object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throughs.somethingElse
```
This would result in different behavior because "somethingElse" is a different property than "throughs" and would not refer to the same object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throughs.map(x => x)
```
This would result in different behavior because "throughs.map(x => x)" is a different expression than "throughs" and would not refer to the same object.

DONE.
