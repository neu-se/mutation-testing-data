  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
longitude <= -180 || longitude >= 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it allows `longitude` to be equal to -180 or 180, which would otherwise be considered invalid according to the original condition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
longitude < -180 || longitude > 180 || longitude === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it also checks for the case where `longitude` is equal to 0, which would otherwise be considered valid according to the original condition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
longitude < -180 || longitude > 180 || Math.abs(longitude) > 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the case where `Math.abs(longitude)` is greater than 180, which would otherwise be considered invalid according to the original condition.

DONE.
