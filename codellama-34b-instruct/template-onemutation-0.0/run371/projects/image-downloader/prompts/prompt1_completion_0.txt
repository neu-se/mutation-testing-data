  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `!` operator to check if `options.url` is falsy, while the new code fragment uses the `===` operator to check if `options.url` is strictly equal to `undefined`. If `options.url` is `null`, `false`, or an empty string, the original code fragment would evaluate to `true`, while the new code fragment would evaluate to `false`.
