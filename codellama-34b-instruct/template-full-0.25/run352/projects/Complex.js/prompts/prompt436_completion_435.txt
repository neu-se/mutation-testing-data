  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places || 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would always return `1` if `places` is falsy, which would cause the `Math.pow` function to always return `10`, regardless of the value of `places`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places && 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would always return `0` if `places` is falsy, which would cause the `Math.pow` function to always return `0`, regardless of the value of `places`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places * 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would always return `0` if `places` is falsy, which would cause the `Math.pow` function to always return `0`, regardless of the value of `places`.

DONE.
