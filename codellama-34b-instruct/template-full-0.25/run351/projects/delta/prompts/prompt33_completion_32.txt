  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attr[key] !== base[key] && base[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `base[key]` is undefined, while this new code fragment checks if it is not undefined. This change would cause the `invert` function to behave differently when `base[key]` is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attr[key] !== base[key] && base[key] === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `base[key]` is undefined, while this new code fragment checks if it is null. This change would cause the `invert` function to behave differently when `base[key]` is null.
