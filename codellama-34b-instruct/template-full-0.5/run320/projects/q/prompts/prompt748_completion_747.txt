  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected instead of resolved, which would cause the `onFulfilled` function to be skipped and the `onRejected` function to be called instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be notified instead of resolved or rejected, which would cause the `onProgress` function to be called instead of `onFulfilled` or `onRejected`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected with a new error, which would cause the `onRejected` function to be called instead of `onFulfilled`.

DONE.
