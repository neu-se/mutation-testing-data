  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to the `read` function would be `null`, which is not a valid callback function. This would cause the function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, () => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to the `read` function would be a no-op function, which would not perform any operations when called. This would cause the function to not perform the expected operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, (err, data) => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to the `read` function would be a function that takes two arguments, but does not perform any operations with them. This would cause the function to not perform the expected operation.

DONE.
