  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the reason, which could change the behavior of the code that handles the rejection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the reason by 2, which could change the behavior of the code that handles the rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the reason, which could change the behavior of the code that handles the rejection.

DONE.
