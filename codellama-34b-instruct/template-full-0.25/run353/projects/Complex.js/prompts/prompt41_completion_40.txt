  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log10
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log10` returns the base 10 logarithm of a number, while `Math.log` returns the natural logarithm.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log2
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log2` returns the base 2 logarithm of a number, while `Math.log` returns the natural logarithm.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log(a * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log(a * b)` returns the natural logarithm of the product of `a` and `b`, while `Math.log(a + b)` returns the natural logarithm of the sum of `a` and `b`.

DONE.
