  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `line.length` is a number, and `line` is a `Delta` object, so the `length` property would be undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `line.ops` is an array of `Op` objects, and `length` is a property of the `Delta` object, so the `length` property would be undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.ops[0].length
```
This would result in different behavior because `line.ops[0]` is an `Op` object, and `length` is a property of the `Delta` object, so the `length` property would be undefined.

DONE.
