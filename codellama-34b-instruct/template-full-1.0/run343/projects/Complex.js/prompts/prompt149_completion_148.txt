  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```[this['isInfinite']()]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if `this` is infinite, regardless of the value of `z`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```[Math.abs(this['re']) > Math.abs(this['im'])]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the magnitude of the real part is greater than the magnitude of the imaginary part, instead of checking if either part is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```[!this['isInfinite']() && !z['isInfinite']()]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `true` if neither `this` nor `z` are infinite.

DONE.
