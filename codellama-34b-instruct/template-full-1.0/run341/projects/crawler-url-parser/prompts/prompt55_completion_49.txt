  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the parsed URL object, which is different from the absolute URL string that the original code fragment returns.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the current URL string, which is different from the absolute URL string that the original code fragment returns.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the base URL string, which is different from the absolute URL string that the original code fragment returns.

DONE.
