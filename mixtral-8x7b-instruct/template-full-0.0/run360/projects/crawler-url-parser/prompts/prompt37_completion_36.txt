 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would return `null` if the `baseUrlStr` is not provided and the `currentUrlStr` does not start with a protocol, whereas the original code would add 'http://' as the default protocol in that case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` object would not be removed from the parsed URL, and the `parse` function would return an object with an additional `query` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, <PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slashesDenoteHost` option would be set to `false`, which would affect how the URL is parsed, especially when the URL contains a path with multiple slashes.
