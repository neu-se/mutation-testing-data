Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
collect.push(value + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the value being collected by incrementing it by 1, which changes the output of the `map` function from the original behavior of applying the callback to simply adding 1 to each element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
collect.push(self[index]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it collects the original value from the array instead of applying the callback function, effectively bypassing the intended transformation of the array elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
collect.push(callback(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the callback function with only the value, omitting the index and the original array, which may lead to incorrect results if the callback relies on those additional parameters.

DONE.
