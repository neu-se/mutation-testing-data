  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `undefined`.
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `continuer` which is a reference to the `continuer` function, while `undefined` is not a function and would cause the code to error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `null`.
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `continuer` which is a reference to the `continuer` function, while `null` is not a function and would cause the code to error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `console.log('foo')`.
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `continuer` which is a reference to the `continuer` function, while `console.log('foo')` is a function call that would log the string "foo" to the console and would not affect the execution of the surrounding code.

DONE.
