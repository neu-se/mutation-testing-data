  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
``` 
Object.keys.reverse();
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys()` method returns an array of keys but `reverse()` method reverses the array, resulting in a different set of keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values();
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values()` method returns an array of values but without the keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries();
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries()` method returns an array of key-value pairs but it is not guaranteed to be in the same order as the original object.

DONE.
