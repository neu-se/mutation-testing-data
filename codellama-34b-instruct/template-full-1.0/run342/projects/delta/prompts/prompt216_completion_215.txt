  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the concat method to only concat the second half of the delta, rather than the entire delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the concat method to only concat the first half of the delta, rather than the entire delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[...other.ops].reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the concat method to concat the delta in reverse order, rather than the original order.

DONE.
