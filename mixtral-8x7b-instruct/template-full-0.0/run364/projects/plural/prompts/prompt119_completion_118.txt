 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/ic$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it only matches words ending in "ic" instead of "ics".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/^ics$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it only matches the string "ics" instead of any word ending in "ics".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/[aeiou]$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it only matches words ending in a vowel instead of words ending in "ics".

DONE.
