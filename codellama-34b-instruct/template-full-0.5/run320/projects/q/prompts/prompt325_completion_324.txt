  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` method would be called on `null` instead of the promise object, which would likely result in a `TypeError` being thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` method would be called on `undefined` instead of the promise object, which would likely result in a `TypeError` being thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` method would be called on the string `"hello"` instead of the promise object, which would likely result in a `TypeError` being thrown.

DONE.
