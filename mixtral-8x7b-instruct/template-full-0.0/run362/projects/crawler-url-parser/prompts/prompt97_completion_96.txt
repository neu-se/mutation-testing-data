 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrl !== null && currentUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `!==` operator instead of `&&`, which checks for both null and undefined values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrl && currentUrl.hasOwnProperty('url')
