  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `requestTick` function would be called with the `flush` function as an argument, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setTimeout` function would be called with the `flush` function as an argument, which would cause the `flush` function to be executed after a delay of 0 milliseconds, rather than immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setImmediate(flush);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setImmediate` function would be called with the `flush` function as an argument, which would cause the `flush` function to be executed after all other immediate tasks have been executed, rather than immediately.

DONE.
