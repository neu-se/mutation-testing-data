 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
point.coordinates.length !== 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if the `coordinates` array has 2 elements, but does not check if `point.coordinates` is an array. This could lead to a TypeError in the original code not being thrown when a non-array argument is passed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.isArray(point.coordinates) && point.coordinates.length !== 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it reverses the condition, checking if `point.coordinates` is an array and has a length of 2. This would cause the function to incorrectly accept inputs with more or fewer than 2 elements in the `coordinates` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.isArray(point.coordinates) && point.coordinates.length === 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks
