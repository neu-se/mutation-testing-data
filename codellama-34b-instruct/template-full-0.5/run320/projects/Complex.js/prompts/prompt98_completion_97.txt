  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] === 'j' || tokens[i + 1] === 'J'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now check for the presence of the letter "j" or "J" instead of "i" or "I".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] === '1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now check for the presence of the number "1" instead of "i" or "I".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] === 'a' || tokens[i + 1] === 'A'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now check for the presence of the letter "a" or "A" instead of "i" or "I".

DONE.
