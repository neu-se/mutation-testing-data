  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this.matches
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for paths that are not governed by this rule, which would invert the logic of the `query` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this.verbs[verb]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for verbs that are not explicitly allowed or denied, which would return null if the verb is not in the `verbs` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb in this.regex
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for verbs that are in the regex, which would return a boolean value and would not affect the `verbs` object.

DONE.
