  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(name, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a shallow copy of the rule, rather than a deep copy, which could cause issues if the rule is modified later.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(name, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a deep copy of the rule, which could cause issues if the rule is modified later.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(name, !deep)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a deep copy of the rule if `deep` is `false`, and a shallow copy if `deep` is `true`, which could cause issues if the rule is modified later.

DONE.
