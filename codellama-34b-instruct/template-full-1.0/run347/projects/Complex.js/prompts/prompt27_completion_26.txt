  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var message = 'Something is wrong';
```
This would result in different behavior because `message` would no longer be an instance of `SyntaxError` and would not throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var message = SyntaxError('Something is wrong');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `message` variable would now be an instance of `SyntaxError` but the error message would be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var message = 'Something went wrong';
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different.

DONE.
