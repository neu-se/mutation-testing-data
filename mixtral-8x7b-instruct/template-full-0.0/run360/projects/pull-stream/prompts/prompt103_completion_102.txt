 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 * data
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the `data` by 1, which doesn't change the value, but the test suite should still catch this mutation since it's not equivalent to the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the `data` to a string before logging it. The test suite should catch this mutation if it expects a specific data type for the output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.error(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it logs the `data` using `console.error` instead of `console.log`. The test suite should catch this mutation if it checks the log output or the console for specific messages.

DONE.
