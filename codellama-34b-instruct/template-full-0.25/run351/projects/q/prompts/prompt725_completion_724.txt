  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect.then(function(result) {
    return result;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the result of the `inspect` method, rather than the original promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect.catch(function(error) {
    return error;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the error from the `inspect` method, rather than the original promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect.finally(function() {
    return promise;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the original promise, rather than the result of the `inspect` method.

DONE.
