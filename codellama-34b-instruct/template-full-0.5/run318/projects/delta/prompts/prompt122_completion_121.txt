  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is expecting an Op object, but the replacement code fragment is providing a number. This would cause the program to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is expecting an Op object, but the replacement code fragment is providing null. This would cause the program to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is expecting an Op object, but the replacement code fragment is providing an empty object. This would cause the program to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
