  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a nullish coalescing operator (`??`) to check if `_read` is `undefined` or `null`, and if so, it calls `nextStream`. However, if we replace the placeholder with `1`, it will always execute `nextStream`, regardless of the value of `_read`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a nullish coalescing operator (`??`) to check if `_read` is `undefined` or `null`, and if so, it calls `nextStream`. However, if we replace the placeholder with `_read === 1`, it will always check if `_read` is equal to `1`, and if so, it will call `nextStream`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(_read || 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code
