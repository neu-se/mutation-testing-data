  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis|thesis/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex would match "thesis" twice, causing the function to return the wrong result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis|crisis/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex would match "crisis" twice, causing the function to return the wrong result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis|thesis|crisis/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex would match "thesis" and "crisis" twice, causing the function to return the wrong result.

DONE.
