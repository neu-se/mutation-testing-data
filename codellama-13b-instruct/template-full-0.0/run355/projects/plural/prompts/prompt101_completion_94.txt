  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/a/, 'e'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `,` operator to concatenate the two strings, while the buggy code fragment uses the `+` operator to concatenate them. This would cause the pluralization function to produce incorrect results for words that end in "a".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

/a/, 'e'
