  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof StopIteration !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `StopIteration` is undefined, while the new code fragment checks if it is defined. This would cause the code to behave differently when `StopIteration` is defined, as the new code fragment would enter the `if` block, while the original code fragment would not.

DONE.
