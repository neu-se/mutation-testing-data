  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys` returns an array of the keys of an object, whereas `Object.assign` returns a new object with the own enumerable string-keyed properties of one or more source objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of the values of an object's own enumerable string-keyed properties, whereas `Object.assign` returns a new object with the own enumerable string-keyed properties of one or more source objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries` returns an array of the key-value pairs of an object's own enumerable string-keyed properties, whereas `Object.assign` returns a new object with the own enumerable string-keyed properties of one or more source objects.
