  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` returns the index of the first match, whereas `match` returns the matched substring.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.replace
```
This would result in different behavior because `replace` replaces the matched substring with a new string, whereas `match` returns the matched substring.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split
```
This would result in different behavior because `split` splits the string into an array of substrings, whereas `match` returns the matched substring.

DONE.
