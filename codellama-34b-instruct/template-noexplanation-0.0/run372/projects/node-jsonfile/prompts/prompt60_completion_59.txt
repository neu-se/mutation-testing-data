  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Buffer.isBuffer(content)
```
This change will cause the `stripBom` function to always execute the `content = content.toString('utf8')` line, even if `content` is not a buffer. This could potentially cause the function to throw an error if `content` is not a string or a buffer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Buffer.isBuffer(content) && content.length > 0
```
This change will cause the `stripBom` function to only execute the `content = content.toString('utf8')` line if `content` is a buffer and its length is greater than 0. This could potentially cause the function to return a different result than the original code if `content` is a buffer with a length of 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Buffer.isBuffer(content) || content.length > 0
```
This change will cause the `stripBom` function to only execute the `
