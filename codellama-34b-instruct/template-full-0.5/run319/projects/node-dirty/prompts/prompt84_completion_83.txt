  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\r'
```
This would result in different behavior because `\r` is the carriage return character, which is different from the newline character `\n`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty string is not the same as a newline character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because a space is not the same as a newline character.

DONE.
