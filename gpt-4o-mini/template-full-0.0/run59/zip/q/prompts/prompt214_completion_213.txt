Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof value === "string"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly treat string values as promise-like, leading to non-promise strings being coerced into promises, which is not the intended functionality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value instanceof Object
```
This would result in different behavior because it would classify all objects, including non-promise objects, as promise-like, potentially causing unexpected behavior when handling non-promise objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly identify `null` as a promise-like value, which would lead to `null` being passed to the `coerce` function, resulting in errors or unintended behavior.

DONE.
