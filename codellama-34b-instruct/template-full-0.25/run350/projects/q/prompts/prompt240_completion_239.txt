  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `nearerValue` is a promise, and `null` is a primitive value, so the comparison would always return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `nearerValue` is a promise, and `undefined` is a primitive value, so the comparison would always return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `nearerValue` is a promise, and `0` is a primitive value, so the comparison would always return `false`.

DONE.
