  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
      1 + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original fragment is computing the sine of `b`, while the suggested fragment is computing the sine of `1 + b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
      cos(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original fragment is computing the sine of `b`, while the suggested fragment is computing the cosine of `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
      tan(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original fragment is computing the sine of `b`, while the suggested fragment is computing the tangent of `b`.

DONE.
