 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPromiseAlike` function checks if the value is not null or undefined. By replacing it with null, the `coerce` function will be called, which might have different behavior depending on the implementation of `coerce`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
