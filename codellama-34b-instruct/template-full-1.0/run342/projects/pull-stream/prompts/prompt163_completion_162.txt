  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical NOT operator to check if the array is empty, while this code fragment uses the equality operator to check if the array's length is equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length > 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical NOT operator to check if the array is empty, while this code fragment checks if the array's length is greater than 10.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.indexOf(null) === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical NOT operator to check if the array is empty, while this code fragment uses the array's indexOf method to check if the array contains the value null.

DONE.
