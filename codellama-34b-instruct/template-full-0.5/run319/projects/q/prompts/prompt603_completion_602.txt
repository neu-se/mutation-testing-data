  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` creates a new deferred object, whereas `defer` is a reference to an existing deferred object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer(null)` creates a new deferred object with a `null` value, whereas `defer` is a reference to an existing deferred object with a non-null value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer(function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer(function () {})` creates a new deferred object with a function value, whereas `defer` is a reference to an existing deferred object with a different value.

DONE.
