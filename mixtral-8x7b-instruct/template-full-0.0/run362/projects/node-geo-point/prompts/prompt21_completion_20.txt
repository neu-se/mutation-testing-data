 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'latitude' in object && 'longitude' in object
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the presence of properties using the `in` operator, which also returns true for inherited properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.keys(object).length !== 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the object has exactly two keys, but does not ensure that the keys are 'latitude' and 'longitude'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(object, 'latitude') && Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(object, 'longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty` method with `Object.prototype.call` to ensure that the object has its own 'latitude' and 'longitude' properties, but it does not check their values.
