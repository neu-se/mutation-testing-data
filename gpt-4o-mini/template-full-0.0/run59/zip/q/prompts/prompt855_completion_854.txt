Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of resolving the promise with the value, it incorrectly rejects the promise, leading to a failure state instead of a success state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it resolves the promise with `null` regardless of the actual value, which may not be the intended outcome and could lead to unexpected results in promise chaining.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the resolved value by incrementing it by 1, which changes the outcome of the promise resolution and may lead to incorrect results in subsequent promise handlers.

DONE.
