  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment would ignore the first two arguments passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment would only include the first three arguments passed to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment would include all the arguments passed to the function except the last one.

DONE.
