  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule[0]` is a regular expression that matches the input word, while `rule[1]` is the replacement string. Using `rule[0]` instead of `rule[1]` would result in the original word being returned, which is not the intended behavior of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1].toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the uppercase version of the replacement string, which is not the intended behavior of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1].split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the replacement string with the characters reversed, which is not the intended behavior of the function.

DONE.
