  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first part of the glob pattern, potentially missing other files that match the pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',').slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider all but the first part of the glob pattern, potentially including files that should not be included.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',').filter((part) => part !== '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would filter out any empty parts of the glob pattern, potentially excluding files that should be included.

DONE.
