  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan(y / x)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan2` is a function that takes two arguments and returns the arctangent of the ratio of the two arguments, while `Math.atan` is a function that takes one argument and returns the arctangent of that argument. Using `Math.atan` instead of `Math.atan2` would cause the code to calculate the bearing incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan(y / x) + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because adding `Math.PI` to the result of `Math.atan` would cause the bearing to be calculated incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan(y / x) - Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because subtracting `Math.PI` from the result of `Math.atan` would cause the bearing to be calculated incorrectly.

DONE
