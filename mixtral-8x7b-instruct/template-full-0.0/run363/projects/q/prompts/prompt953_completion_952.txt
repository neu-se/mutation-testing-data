 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject = function() {};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` function is overwritten with an empty function, causing the promise to never reject and get stuck in a pending state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve = function() {};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` function is overwritten with an empty function, causing the promise to never resolve and get stuck in a pending state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.dispatch = function() {};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this.dispatch` function is overwritten with an empty function, causing the `dispatch` method to have no effect and the promise to never resolve or reject.

DONE.
