  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always negate the `end` variable, causing the loop to continue even if it should have stopped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only execute the `read` function if `end` is truthy and `test(data)` is truthy, whereas the original code would execute it regardless of the value of `end`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only execute the `read` function if `end` is falsy or `test(data)` is truthy, whereas the original code would execute it regardless of the value of `end`.

DONE.
