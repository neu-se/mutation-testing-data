  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deferred.notify` method to be called with an undefined argument, which would likely cause it to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"deferred.notifyError"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deferred.notifyError` method to be called instead of `deferred.notify`, which could have different semantics.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deferred.notify` method to be called with a null argument, which could have different semantics.

DONE.
