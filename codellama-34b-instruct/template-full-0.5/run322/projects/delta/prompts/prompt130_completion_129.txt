  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate one extra time, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate one less time, potentially leading to an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - index * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate twice as many times, potentially leading to an incorrect result.

DONE.
