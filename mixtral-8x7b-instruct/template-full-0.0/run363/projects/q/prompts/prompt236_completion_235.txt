 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[resolvedPromise].concat(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the argument list passed to `promiseDispatch.apply()`, which could cause unexpected results in the method call.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
resolvedPromise, progressListeners
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes a different second argument to `promiseDispatch.apply()`, which is expecting `op` (an operation string) and `operands` (an array of operands).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch, args
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the first argument passed to `apply()`, which could cause unexpected behavior in the method call.

DONE.
