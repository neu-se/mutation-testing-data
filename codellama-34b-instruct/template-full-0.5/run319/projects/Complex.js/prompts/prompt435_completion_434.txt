  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always return 0, regardless of the input value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always return 2, regardless of the input value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always return the value of the variable `a`, regardless of the input value.

DONE.
