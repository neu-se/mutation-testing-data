  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'coordinate'
```
This would result in different behavior because the property name is incorrect. The original code expects the property name to be 'coordinates', but if it is replaced with 'coordinate', the code will not work as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'coordinates'[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the property value is now an array instead of an object. The original code expects the property value to be an object with two properties, 'latitude' and 'longitude', but if it is replaced with an array, the code will not work as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'coordinates'[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the property value is now an array with two elements, but the original code expects the property value to be an object with two properties. The code will not work as intended if the property value is an array with two elements.

DONE.
