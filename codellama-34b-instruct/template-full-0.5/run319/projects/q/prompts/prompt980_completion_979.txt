  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver())` line would no longer push a function to the `nodeArgs` array, which could cause the `this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs])` line to fail or behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver())` line would push `undefined` to the `nodeArgs` array, which could cause the `this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs])` line to fail or behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver())` line would push a bound function to the `nodeArgs` array, which could cause the `this.dispatch("post
