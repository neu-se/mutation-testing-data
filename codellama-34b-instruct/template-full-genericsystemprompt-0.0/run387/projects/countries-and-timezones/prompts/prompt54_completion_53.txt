  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones.slice(0, 10)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the first 10 timezones, while the original code fragment returns all timezones.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones.filter(tz => tz.deprecated)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return deprecated timezones, while the original code fragment returns all timezones.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones.map(tz => tz.name)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the names of the timezones, while the original code fragment returns the timezones themselves.

DONE.
