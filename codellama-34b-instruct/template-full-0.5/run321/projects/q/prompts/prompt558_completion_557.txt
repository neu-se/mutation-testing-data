  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was expecting a value to be passed as an argument, but by replacing it with `undefined`, the function would receive `undefined` instead, which could cause it to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was expecting a value to be passed as an argument, but by replacing it with `null`, the function would receive `null` instead, which could cause it to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was expecting a value to be passed as an argument, but by replacing it with a string, the function would receive a string instead, which could cause it to behave differently.

DONE.
