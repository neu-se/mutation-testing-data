 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the addition operator instead of the increment operator, which may not accurately reflect the intended behavior of incrementing the variable i.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a random number instead of incrementing the variable i, which would cause the function to return a different value each time it is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
j++
```
This would result in different behavior because it increments the variable j, which is not defined in the original code, instead of incrementing the variable i. This would cause the function to return unexpected results.

DONE.
