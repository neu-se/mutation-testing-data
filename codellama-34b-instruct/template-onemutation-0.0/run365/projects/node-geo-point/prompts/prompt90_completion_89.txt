  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(θ) * sinδ * cosφ1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `sin` function to calculate the sine of the bearing, while the new code fragment uses the `sin` function to calculate the sine of the angular distance. This would cause the `calculateDestination` method to return a different result, which would indicate a bug in the test suite.

DONE.
