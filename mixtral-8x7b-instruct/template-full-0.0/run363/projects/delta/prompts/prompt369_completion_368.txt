 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'='
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the comparison operator from `!==` (not identical) to `==` (equal). This could lead to unexpected behavior when comparing types, as `==` performs type coercion.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'=== false'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the comparison from `!== 'insert'` to `=== false`. This would only evaluate to true if the value is explicitly `false`, and not if the value is falsy but not equal to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'!thisIter.peekType()'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the comparison from checking if the peeked type is not `'insert'` to checking if the `OpIterator` instance `thisIter` is not truthy. This could lead to unexpected behavior if `thisIter` is ever
