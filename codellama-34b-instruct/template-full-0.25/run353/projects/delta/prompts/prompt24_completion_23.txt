  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the value of `a[key]`, regardless of whether it is equal to `b[key]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the value of `b[key] + 1`, regardless of whether it is equal to `a[key]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] + b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the sum of `a[key]` and `b[key]`, regardless of whether they are equal.

DONE.
