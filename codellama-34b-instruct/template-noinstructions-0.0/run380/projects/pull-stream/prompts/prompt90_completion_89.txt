  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `test` function, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if the `test` function returns `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function is being called with two arguments instead of one, which may cause it to behave differently or throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function is being called with two arguments, the second of which is `null`, which may cause it to behave differently or throw an error.

DONE.
