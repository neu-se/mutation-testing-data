  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.max` returns the largest of two or more numbers, whereas `Math.min` returns the smallest.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.delete` is a property of the `op` object that represents the number of characters to be deleted, whereas `Math.min` is a function that returns the smallest of two or more numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.retain` is a property of the `op` object that represents the number of characters to be retained, whereas `Math.min` is a function that returns the smallest of two or more numbers.

DONE.
