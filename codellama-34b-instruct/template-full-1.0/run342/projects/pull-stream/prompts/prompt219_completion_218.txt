  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment expects `data` to be passed to the callback `cb`, while `null` would not provide any data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment expects `data` to be passed to the callback `cb`, while `undefined` would also not provide any data, but would have a different value than `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment expects `data` to be passed to the callback `cb`, while `"hello"` would provide a different, non-`null` value that could potentially cause different behavior in the surrounding code.

DONE.
