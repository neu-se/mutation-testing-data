  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.clear()
```
This would result in different behavior because `clear()` removes all entries from the Map, while `delete()` only removes a specific entry.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set(baseUrlStr, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `set()` adds or updates an entry in the Map, while `delete()` only removes an entry.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.add(baseUrlStr + 'xyz')
```
This would result in different behavior because `add()` adds a new entry to the Map, while `delete()` only removes an existing entry.

DONE.
