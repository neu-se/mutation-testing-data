  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections([]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `resetUnhandledRejections(<PLACEHOLDER>)`, which means the function `resetUnhandledRejections` is called with the argument `<PLACEHOLDER>`. However, in this option, we are replacing `<PLACEHOLDER>` with an empty array `[]`, which means the function is called with an empty array as its argument, which would likely cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `resetUnhandledRejections(<PLACEHOLDER>)`, which means the function `resetUnhandledRejections` is called with the argument `<PLACEHOLDER>`. However, in this option, we are replacing `<PLACEHOLDER>` with the value `null`, which means the function is called with `null` as its
