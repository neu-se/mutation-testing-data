Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a resolved promise immediately, bypassing the intended behavior of calling the `nfapply` method on the callback, which is meant to handle Node-style callbacks.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a rejected promise immediately, instead of attempting to invoke the callback with the provided arguments, which would lead to an error being thrown rather than executing the callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to wait for all promises in an array to resolve, rather than applying the callback to the arguments, which would change the expected flow of promise resolution and potentially lead to unexpected results.

DONE.
