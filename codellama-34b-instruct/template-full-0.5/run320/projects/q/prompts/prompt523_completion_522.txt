  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return object[name].apply(object, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would apply the `apply` method to the `name` property of `object`, instead of the `object` itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return object[name].call(object, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `call` method on the `name` property of `object`, instead of the `object` itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return object[name](args);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `name` property of `object` as a function, instead of using the `apply` method.

DONE.
