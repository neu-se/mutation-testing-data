  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.access('./wrong/path', fs.constants.R_OK);
```
This would result in different behavior because it's trying to access a non-existent file, which will throw a different error than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.access(src, fs.constants.W_OK);
```
This would result in different behavior because it's trying to write to the source file, instead of reading it, which could cause a different error if the file is not writable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.access(src, fs.constants.X_OK);
```
This would result in different behavior because it's trying to execute the source file, which could cause a different error if the file is not executable.

DONE.
