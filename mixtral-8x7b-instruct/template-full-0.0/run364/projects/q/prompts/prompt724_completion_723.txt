 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect()` method would not be called on the promise, and the `state` property would not be checked. This could cause the function to treat a resolved promise as if it were pending or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPromise()` check would return `false`, and the `promise.inspect()` method would not be called. This could cause the function to treat a non-promise value as if it were a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
