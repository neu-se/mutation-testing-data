  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an array with two copies of the key, rather than just the key itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an array with the key incremented by 1, rather than just the key itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an array with the key decremented by 1, rather than just the key itself.

DONE.
