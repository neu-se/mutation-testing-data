  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the `result.value` property, which may not exist or may have a different value than `result`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first element of the `result` array, which may not exist or may have a different value than `result`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.then(function (value) { return value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a promise that resolves to the value of `result`, which may not be the same as the original code.

DONE.
