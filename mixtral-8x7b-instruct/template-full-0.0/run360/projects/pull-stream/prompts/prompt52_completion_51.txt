 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument passed to the `s` function would change from the `read` function to the number `1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument passed to the `s` function would change from the `read` function to `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument passed to the `s` function would change from the `read` function to the current object (`this`).

DONE.
