Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('_')
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would split the `spec` string on underscores instead of forward slashes, which would produce a different array of tokens.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split(/\s+/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would split the `spec` string on whitespace characters instead of forward slashes, which would produce a different array of tokens.

```
spec.split(/\W+/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would split the `spec` string on non-word characters (i.e., characters other than letters, digits, and underscores) instead of forward slashes, which would produce a different array of tokens.

It's important to note that the resulting behavior would depend on the specific input string passed to the `compile` function. In general, replacing the `
