 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method expects two arguments, but it would receive `op` and `args` as properties of a null object, causing a TypeError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method expects two arguments, but it would receive an empty array, causing `op` and `args` to be `undefined`, which might lead to unexpected behavior in the `dispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{op: 1, args: [2, 3]}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method expects two separate arguments, but it would receive an object with `op` and `args` properties. This could lead to unexpected behavior in the `dispatch` method, as it might not be designed to handle objects with these properties.

DONE.
