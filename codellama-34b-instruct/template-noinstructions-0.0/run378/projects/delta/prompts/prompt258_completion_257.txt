  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.delete` is a different property than `thisOp.insert`, and it would cause the code to behave differently when the `thisOp` object has a `delete` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.retain` is a different property than `thisOp.insert`, and it would cause the code to behave differently when the `thisOp` object has a `retain` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.attributes` is a different property than `thisOp.insert`, and it would cause the code to behave differently when the `thisOp` object has an `attributes` property.

DONE.
