  Option 1: The `2 * (r - a)` can be replaced with `2 * (r - x)` which would result in different behavior because the `x` variable is not defined in the given code snippet, and the `x` value used in the second calculation would be a NaN value, making the entire calculation return NaN.

Option 2: The `2 * (r - a)` can be replaced with `2 * (r - 0.5 * a)` which would result in different behavior because the `0.5` factor would change the result of the sine calculation, leading to a different output for the same input.

Option 3: The `2 * (r - a)` can be replaced with `2 * (r + a)` which would result in different behavior because the `+` sign instead of the `-` sign would make the calculation return a positive value, instead of the negative value returned by the original code.
