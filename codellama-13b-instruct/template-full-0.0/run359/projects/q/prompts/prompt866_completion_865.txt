  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a promise that resolves to the value of the `deferred` object, while the modified code fragment returns a promise that resolves to `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a promise that resolves to the value of the `deferred` object, while the modified code fragment returns a promise that rejects with the `deferred` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a promise that resolves to the value of the `deferred` object, while the modified code fragment returns a promise that notifies the `deferred` object.

DONE.
