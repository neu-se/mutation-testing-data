 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'#' + Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a random fragment identifier to the URL, which changes the URL without affecting the rest of the code's behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'#some-fragment'
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a static fragment identifier to the URL, which changes the URL without affecting the rest of the code's behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'?foo=bar'
