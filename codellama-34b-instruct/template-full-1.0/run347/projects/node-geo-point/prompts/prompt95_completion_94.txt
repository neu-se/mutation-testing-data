  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the latitude to always be zero, regardless of the input coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ1 * cosδ + cosφ1 * sinδ * cosθ
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the calculation of sinφ2 with a different formula that is not equivalent to the original.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ1 * cosφ2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the calculation of sinφ2 with a different formula that is not equivalent to the original.

DONE.
