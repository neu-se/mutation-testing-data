  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cello'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns 'cellos', while the modified code fragment returns 'cello'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cello' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns 'cellos', while the modified code fragment returns 'cello' + 's', which is 'cellos'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cello' + 'es'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns 'cellos', while the modified code fragment returns 'cello' + 'es', which is 'celloses'.

DONE.
