  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && last
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ended` variable is not being checked in the original code, so the replaced code would always evaluate to `false` when `last` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ended` variable is not being checked in the original code, so the replaced code would always evaluate to `true` when `last` is `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!last
```
This would result in different behavior because the `last` variable is not being checked in the original code, so the replaced code would always evaluate to `true` when `ended` is `true`.

DONE.
