Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it only accesses the first argument instead of all arguments, which would lead to incorrect behavior when multiple arguments are passed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.from(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.from(arguments)` creates a new array from the `arguments` object, which may not behave the same way as `array_slice`, especially if the original function expects a specific slicing behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the number of arguments passed instead of the actual arguments themselves, which would cause the function to fail when it tries to use the arguments in the dispatch call.

DONE.
