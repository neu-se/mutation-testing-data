  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a positive value, whereas the original code fragment could return both positive and negative values depending on the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a value that is a multiple of the input values, whereas the original code fragment could return a value that is not a multiple of the input values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a value that is the difference between the input values, whereas the original code fragment could return a value that is not the difference between the input values.

DONE.
