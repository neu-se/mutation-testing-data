  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return length - elem.delete;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the length of the current array, whereas the replaced code calculates the length of the remainder of the array after the current element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return length * 2 - elem.delete;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the length of the current array, whereas the replaced code calculates the length of the current array multiplied by 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return length + elem.delete;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the length of the current array, whereas the replaced code calculates the length of the current array plus the current element.

DONE.
