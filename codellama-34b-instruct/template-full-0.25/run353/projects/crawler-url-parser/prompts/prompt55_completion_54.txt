  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` value for the `slashesDenoteHost` parameter would cause the `host` property to be set to `null`, which would change the behavior of the `delete parsedUrl.hash` line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `true` value for the `slashesDenoteHost` parameter would cause the `host` property to be set to the value of the `currentUrlStr` parameter, which would change the behavior of the `delete parsedUrl.hash` line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` value for the `parseQueryString` parameter would cause the `query` property to be set to `null`,
