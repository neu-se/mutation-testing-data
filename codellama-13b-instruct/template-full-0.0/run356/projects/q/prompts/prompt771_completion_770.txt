  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promises).allSettled()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `allSettled` method without parentheses, which is a syntax error. The corrected code fragment with parentheses would call the `allSettled` method and return a promise for an array of states (as returned by `inspect`) when the promises have all settled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promises).all()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `allSettled` method, which returns a promise for an array of states (as returned by `inspect`) when the promises have all settled. The corrected code fragment with `all()` would return a promise for an array of the resolved values of the promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promises).allResolved()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `allSettled`
