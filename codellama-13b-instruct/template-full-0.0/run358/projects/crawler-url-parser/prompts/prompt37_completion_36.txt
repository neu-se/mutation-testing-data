  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` function would not be called with the `true` option, which would cause the function to not normalize the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` function would not be called with the `true` option, which would cause the function to not normalize the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` function would not be called with the `true` option, which would cause the function to not normalize the URL.

DONE.
