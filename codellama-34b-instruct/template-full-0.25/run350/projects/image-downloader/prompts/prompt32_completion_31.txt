  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode === 404
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked for a status code of 200, which indicates success, while the new code fragment checks for a status code of 404, which indicates a client error. If the server returns a 404 status code, the original code would continue to consume the response data and resolve the promise, while the new code would reject the promise with a new error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode !== 404
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked for a status code of 200, which indicates success, while the new code fragment checks for a status code that is not 404, which could include other client error status codes. If the server returns a client error status code other than 404, the original code would continue to consume the response data and resolve the promise, while the new code would reject the promise with a new error.
