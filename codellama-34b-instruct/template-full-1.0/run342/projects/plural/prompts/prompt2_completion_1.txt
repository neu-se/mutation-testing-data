  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"1"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a number, but this new code would return a string containing the digit "1", which would not be recognized as a number and would not work properly in mathematical operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"1000"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a number, but this new code would return a string containing the digit "1000", which would not be recognized as a number and would not work properly in mathematical operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"-1"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a non-negative number, but this new code would return a negative number, which would not work properly in mathematical operations.

DONE.
