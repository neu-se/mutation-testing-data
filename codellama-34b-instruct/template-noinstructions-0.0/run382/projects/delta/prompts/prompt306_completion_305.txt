  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the line is empty, while the modified code fragment checks if the line has at least one character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the line is empty, while the modified code fragment checks if the line has at most one character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the line is empty, while the modified code fragment checks if the line has twice as many characters as the original line.

DONE.
