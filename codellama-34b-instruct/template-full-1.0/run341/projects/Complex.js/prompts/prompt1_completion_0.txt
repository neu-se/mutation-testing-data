  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Math.abs(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation operator `-` will return the same value as `Math.abs(x)` if `x` is positive, but will return the negative value of `x` if `x` is negative. This could cause the calculation of the square root to differ significantly from the expected result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2*Math.abs(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `2*Math.abs(x)` will always return a value that is twice the absolute value of `x`, regardless of whether `x` is positive or negative. This could cause the calculation of the square root to be off by a factor of 2 from the expected result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos(Math.sin(x))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.sin` function returns the sine of the input angle
