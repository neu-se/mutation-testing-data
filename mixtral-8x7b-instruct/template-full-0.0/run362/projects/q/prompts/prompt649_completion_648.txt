 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"post", [name, eval(args)]
```
This would result in different behavior because `eval(args)` executes the string `args` as JavaScript code, which can lead to unexpected results or errors, unlike the original code which treats `args` as an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"post", [window[name], args]
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `window` object's property with the name of `name` instead of the method of the object, which can cause a `TypeError: window[name] is not a function` if the property does not exist or is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"post", [name, args.reverse()]
```
This would result in different behavior because it reverses the order of elements in the `args` array, which can cause issues if the method being called relies on the order of arguments
