  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fromLngLatArray(point.coordinates.reverse())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, which would cause the latitude and longitude values to be swapped, leading to incorrect calculations and results.

DONE.
