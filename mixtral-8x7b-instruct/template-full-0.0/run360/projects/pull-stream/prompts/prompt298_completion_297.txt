 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the error-first callback `cb` would always receive an error value, even when there is no error. This is different from the original behavior where `cb` is called without arguments when there is no error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the callback `cb` would now be `undefined` instead of the data read from the `read` function. This is different from the original behavior where the data is passed to the callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.exit(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the process would be terminated instead of continuing with the callback. This is different from the original behavior where the callback is called to handle the result of the `read` operation.

DONE.
