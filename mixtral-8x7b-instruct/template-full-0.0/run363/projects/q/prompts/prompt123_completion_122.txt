 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.keys(object)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns the first key of the object instead of checking if a specific key exists in the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(object, '<some_key>')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the object has a specific property, rather than iterating over all properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Reflect.ownKeys(object).includes('key')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the key is present in the object using the ES6 `Reflect.ownKeys()` method and `Array.prototype.includes()`.

Keep in mind that these changes may not necessarily indicate a weakness in the test suite, but could also point to missing edge cases in the code. DONE.
