  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `sec()` expects the argument to be the real part of the complex number, while `b` is the imaginary part. Therefore, using `b` instead of `a` would cause the function to return the incorrect value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2*a
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `csc()` expects the argument to be the real part of the complex number, while `2*a` is the double of the real part. Therefore, using `2*a` instead of `a` would cause the function to return the incorrect value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a+b
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `asin()` expects the argument to be a complex number, while `a+b` is the sum of the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. Therefore, using `a+b` instead of `a`
