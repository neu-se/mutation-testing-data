  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length < 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `arguments` object has more than 2 elements, while this replacement checks if it has less than 2 elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length === 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `arguments` object has more than 2 elements, while this replacement checks if it has exactly 2 elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `arguments` object has more than 2 elements, while this replacement checks if it has more than 1 element.

DONE.
