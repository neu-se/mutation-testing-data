  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(utcOffset + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getOffsetStr()` function would receive a different value for `offset` and would return a different string. In the original code, `getOffsetStr(utcOffset)` is called, which returns a string representing the timezone offset without any adjustments. By adding 1 to `utcOffset`, we are effectively changing the timezone offset by 1 minute, which would result in a different string being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(dstOffset)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getOffsetStr()` function would receive a different value for `offset` and would return a different string. In the original code, `getOffsetStr(utcOffset)` is called, which returns a string representing the timezone offset in UTC (without any adjustments for daylight saving time). By calling `getOffsetStr(dstOffset)` instead, we are effectively changing the timezone offset to the one adjusted for daylight
