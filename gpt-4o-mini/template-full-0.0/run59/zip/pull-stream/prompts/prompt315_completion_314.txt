Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the callback response from returning the data to indicating a successful operation with a boolean value, which may lead to incorrect handling of the data downstream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `undefined` instead of the expected data could cause the consumer of this function to misinterpret the result, potentially leading to runtime errors or unexpected behavior when trying to access properties on the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the `end` value instead of the `data`, which could lead to confusion or errors in the logic that expects the actual data to be processed rather than an end signal.

DONE.
