  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as the first argument to `rejected` instead of `void 0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be passed as the first argument to `rejected` instead of `void 0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, rejected, void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because an additional `void 0` argument would be passed to `rejected`, which would change the function's behavior.

DONE.
