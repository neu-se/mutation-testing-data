  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isStopIteration === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isStopIteration` function is not defined in the provided code, so this replacement would cause a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isStopIteration !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isStopIteration` function is not defined in the provided code, so this replacement would cause a `ReferenceError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof isStopIteration === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isStopIteration` function is not defined in the provided code, so this replacement would cause a `ReferenceError`.

DONE.
