Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `null` instead of `end` would cause the callback to receive `null` as the first argument, which may lead to incorrect handling of the end of the stream by the consumer of this function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `data` instead of `end` would pass the data read from the stream as the first argument to the callback, which is not the intended behavior when signaling the end of the stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because returning the negation of `end` would yield a boolean value (either `true` or `false`) instead of the expected `end` value, potentially causing confusion in the callback regarding the state of the stream.

DONE.
