  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('person', 'peoples')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the plural form of "person" as "people," while this new code fragment adds the plural form as "peoples."

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('person', 'persons')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the plural form of "person" as "people," while this new code fragment adds the plural form as "persons."

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('person', 'humans')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the plural form of "person" as "people," while this new code fragment adds the plural form as "humans."

DONE.
