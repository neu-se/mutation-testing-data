  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].match
```
This would result in different behavior because `test` is a method of the `RegExp` object, while `match` is a method of the `String` object. In the original code, `test` is used to check if the word matches the regular expression, while `match` is used to extract the matched substring. Replacing `test` with `match` would cause the code to produce different results.

DONE.
