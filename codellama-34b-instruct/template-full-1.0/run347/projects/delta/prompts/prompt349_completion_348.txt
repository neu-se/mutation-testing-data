  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.invert(null, op.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because `AttributeMap.invert` expects two arguments, but only one is provided, which would lead to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.invert(op.attributes, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `AttributeMap.invert` expects two arguments, but only one is provided, which would lead to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.invert(op.attributes, {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `AttributeMap.invert` expects two arguments, but only one is provided, which would lead to unexpected results.

DONE.
