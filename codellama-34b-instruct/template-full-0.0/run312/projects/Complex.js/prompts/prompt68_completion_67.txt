  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not have any arguments, while this new code fragment has an argument of 1. This would cause the `parser_exit` function to be called with an argument, which could potentially change its behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(a);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not have any arguments, while this new code fragment has an argument of `a`. This would cause the `parser_exit` function to be called with an argument, which could potentially change its behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(b);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not have any arguments, while this new code fragment has an argument of `b`. This would cause the `parser_exit` function to be called with an argument, which could potentially change its behavior.

DONE.
