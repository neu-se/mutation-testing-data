Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.shift();
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift()` removes the first element of the array instead of the last, which would change the order of operations and potentially lead to incorrect results when processing the operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(this.ops.length - 1, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice()` modifies the array in place and can be used to remove elements, but it can also lead to unexpected results if the index or count is not handled correctly, especially if the array is empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.pop(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` does not take any arguments and always removes the last element of the array. By passing `1`, it suggests an intention to remove a specific number of elements, which is not how `pop()` operates, leading to confusion and potential errors in logic.

DONE.
