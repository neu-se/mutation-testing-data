 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data => data === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for null values instead of testing the truthiness of the data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data => !data.hasOwnProperty('testProperty')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the data object doesn't have a property called 'testProperty' instead of testing the truthiness of the data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data => data.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the data is an empty array instead of testing the truthiness of the data.

These changes would result in different behavior and potentially expose weaknesses in the test suite if any of the tests pass despite these modifications. DONE.
