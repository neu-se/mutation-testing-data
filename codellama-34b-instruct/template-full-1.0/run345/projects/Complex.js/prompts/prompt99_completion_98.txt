  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseInt
```
This would result in different behavior because `parseInt` would return the integer part of the string, resulting in a different value for the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number` would return a number, but not necessarily the correct value for the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.round` would return a rounded value of the number, which would result in a different complex number.

DONE.
