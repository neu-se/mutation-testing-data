  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a * b) ** 2
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `Math.LN2` constant is added to the result of `Math.log()`, which is a natural logarithm. However, in this new code fragment, the result of `Math.pow()` is squared, which would result in a much larger value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a ** b
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the product of `a` and `b` is taken, then logged, which is equivalent to `Math.log(a * b)`. However, in this new code fragment, `a` is raised to the power of `b`, which is a completely different operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the product of `a` and `b` is taken, then logged, which is equivalent
