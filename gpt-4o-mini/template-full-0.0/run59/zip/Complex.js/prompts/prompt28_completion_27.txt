Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` computes the square root of a number, which can lead to incorrect results when negative values are passed, unlike `Math.abs` which always returns a non-negative value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
- a
```
This would result in different behavior because negating `a` would change its sign, potentially leading to incorrect logarithmic calculations, especially when `a` is positive, as it would then be treated as a negative value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` rounds down to the nearest integer, which could lead to significant inaccuracies in calculations that expect a floating-point number, unlike `Math.abs` which simply returns the absolute value.

DONE.
