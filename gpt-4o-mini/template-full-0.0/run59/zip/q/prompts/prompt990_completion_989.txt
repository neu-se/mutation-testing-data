Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `nodeArgs` variable instead of the `arguments` object, potentially leading to incorrect argument handling if `nodeArgs` is not populated as expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly creates a new array from the `arguments` object, which could lead to different results if the original `arguments` object is modified later in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `arguments` object with an empty array, causing the function to not pass any arguments to the callback, which would likely lead to unexpected results or errors.

DONE.
