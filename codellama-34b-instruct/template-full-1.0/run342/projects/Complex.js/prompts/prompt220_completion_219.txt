  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` and `Math.sin` have different behaviors. While `Math.sin` returns the sine function, `Math.cos` returns the cosine function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` returns the square root of a value, not the sine or cosine.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a constant representing the ratio of a point to its circumference in a circle. While `Math.sin` and `Math.cos` accept a single real number argument, `Math.PI` is a constant.

DONE.
