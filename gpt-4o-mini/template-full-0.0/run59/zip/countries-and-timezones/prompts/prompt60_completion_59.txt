Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id, { invalidOption: true });
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces an invalid option that the `buildCountry` function may not handle correctly, potentially leading to unexpected results or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id + '1');
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the `id` by appending '1', which may not correspond to a valid country, causing `countries[id]` to be undefined or incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id, { deprecated: false });
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly sets the `deprecated` option to false, which may alter how the country data is processed or returned, potentially omitting necessary information.

DONE.
