  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name, policy.name
```
This would result in different behavior because the second `policy.name` would be interpreted as a property accessor, rather than a variable reference. This would cause the `push` method to add the same policy object to the map multiple times, rather than adding a new policy object with the same name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name, policy.name + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the second `policy.name` would be interpreted as a property accessor, rather than a variable reference. This would cause the `push` method to add a new policy object with a name that is one greater than the original policy name, rather than adding a new policy object with the same name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name, policy.name.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the second `policy.name` would be interpreted as a property accessor, rather
