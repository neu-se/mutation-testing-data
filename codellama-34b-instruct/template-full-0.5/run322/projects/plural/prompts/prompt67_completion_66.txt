  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'meme'
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "meme" is not a valid English word, while "memo" is a valid word. The plural form of "meme" is "memes", which is not the same as the expected output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memo' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be adding the string "s" to the end of the word "memo", resulting in the output "memos", which is not the expected output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memo' + 'es'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be adding the string "es" to the end of the word "memo", resulting in the output "memos", which is not the expected output.

DONE.
