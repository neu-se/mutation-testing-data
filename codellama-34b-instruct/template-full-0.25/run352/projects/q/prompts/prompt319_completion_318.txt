  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op].bind(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method would change the value of `this` inside the `descriptor[op]` function, which could potentially cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op].call(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method would change the value of `this` inside the `descriptor[op]` function, which could potentially cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op].apply(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method would change the value of `this` inside the `descriptor[op]` function, which could potentially cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
