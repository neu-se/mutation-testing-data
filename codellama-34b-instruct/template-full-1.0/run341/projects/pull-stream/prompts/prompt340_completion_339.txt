  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `field` function would always return `true`, making the `filter` function always return `true` as well, regardless of the input data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `field` function would always return `false`, making the `filter` function always return `false` as well, regardless of the input data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `field` function would always return `null`, making the `filter` function always return `null` as well, regardless of the input data.

DONE.
