  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the entire string with a space character, instead of removing the fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, 'something'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the entire string with the word "something", instead of removing the fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, '^'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the entire string with the caret character, instead of removing the fragment.

DONE.
