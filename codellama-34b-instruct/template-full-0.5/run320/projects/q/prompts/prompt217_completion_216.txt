  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of `value`, while the modified code fragment returns the value of `value + 1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of `value`, while the modified code fragment returns the value of `value * 2`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of `value`, while the modified code fragment returns the value of `value - 1`.

DONE.
