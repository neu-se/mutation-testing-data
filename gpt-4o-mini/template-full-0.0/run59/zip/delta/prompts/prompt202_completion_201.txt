Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER> + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it alters the expected output by adding 1 to the result of the `chop()` method, potentially causing an off-by-one error in the final delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER> - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it subtracts 1 from the result of the `chop()` method, which could lead to missing an operation in the final delta, thus changing the intended composition of operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER> * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the result of the `chop()` method by 2, which could lead to duplicating the operations in the final delta, resulting in unintended behavior when applying the delta.

DONE.
