  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type !== 'Point'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `type` property of the `point` object is equal to the string `'Point'`, while the buggy code fragment checks if it is not equal to the string `'Point'`. This would cause the test to fail if the `type` property is equal to `'Point'`, which could indicate a problem with the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type === 'Point'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `type` property of the `point` object is not equal to the string `'Point'`, while the buggy code fragment checks if it is equal to the string `'Point'`. This would cause the test to pass if the `type` property is equal to `'Point'`, which could indicate a problem with the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type === 'LineString
