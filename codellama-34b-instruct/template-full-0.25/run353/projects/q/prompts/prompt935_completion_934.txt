  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.reverse()` would return a reversed version of the array, which may not be the desired behavior in the context of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.sort()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.sort()` would return a sorted version of the array, which may not be the desired behavior in the context of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.map(function(x) { return x * 2; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.map(function(x) { return x * 2; })` would return a new array with each element multiplied by 2, which may not be the desired behavior in the context of the code.

DONE.
