 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[\uFEFF]/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the regular expression to match the UTF-8 BOM character as a character class, which may not catch the BOM in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\uFEFF/g, ''
