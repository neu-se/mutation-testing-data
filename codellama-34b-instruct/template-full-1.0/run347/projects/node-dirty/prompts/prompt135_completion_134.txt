  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    JSON.stringify(key, val)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `JSON.stringify` method to be called with the `key` and `val` parameters in the reverse order, which would result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    typeof key
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `typeof` operator to be applied to the `key` parameter, which would return the string "string" for any input value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    key + val
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `key` and `val` parameters as strings, which would produce an incorrect result if `val` is not a string.

DONE.
