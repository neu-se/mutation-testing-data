 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
baseIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `peekLength()` method from a potentially undefined variable `baseIter`, instead of using the constant value `1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peekLength()
