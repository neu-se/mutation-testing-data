  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= tokens.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, potentially accessing an index that is out of bounds.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > tokens.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would not execute at all, skipping the entire parsing process.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i != tokens.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one fewer time, potentially missing the last token.

DONE.
