  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise", "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to the `bootstrap` function would be `undefined`, which would cause the function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise", null
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to the `bootstrap` function would be `null`, which would cause the function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise", {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to the `bootstrap` function would be an empty object, which would cause the function to throw an error.

DONE.
