  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects an `abort` object to be passed as an argument, while `null` would not have the same properties or methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects an `abort` object to be passed as an argument, while `undefined` would not have the same properties or methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects an `abort` object to be passed as an argument, while an empty object `{}` would not have the same properties or methods.

DONE.
