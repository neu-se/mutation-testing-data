  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This change will cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if `done` is not `null`. This will result in the `doneLackingErr` variable being set to a new `Error` object, which will be thrown when the `sink` function is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done !== null
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if `done` is not `null`. This will result in the `doneLackingErr` variable not being set to a new `Error` object, and the `sink` function will not throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done === undefined
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if `done` is `undefined`, and `false` otherwise. This will result in the `doneLackingErr` variable being set to a new
