  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keys.push(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push an undefined value onto the `keys` array, which would cause the `object_keys` function to return an array with an undefined value, which would likely cause errors in the code that uses the `object_keys` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keys.push(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push a null value onto the `keys` array, which would cause the `object_keys` function to return an array with a null value, which would likely cause errors in the code that uses the `object_keys` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keys.push("");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push an empty string onto the `keys` array, which would cause the `object_keys` function to return an array with an empty string, which would likely cause errors in the code that uses the `
