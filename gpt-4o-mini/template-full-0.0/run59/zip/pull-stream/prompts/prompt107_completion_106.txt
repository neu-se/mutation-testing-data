Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, done
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` instead of `null` may lead to different handling in the `drain` function, potentially causing it to behave incorrectly if it checks for `null` specifically.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done, null
```
This would result in different behavior because switching the order of the arguments changes the expected parameters for the `drain` function, which may lead to unexpected results if it relies on the first argument being `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done, done
```
This would result in different behavior because passing the same `done` callback as both arguments could lead to unintended consequences in the `drain` function, especially if it expects different types of inputs or uses them in a way that assumes they are distinct.

DONE.
