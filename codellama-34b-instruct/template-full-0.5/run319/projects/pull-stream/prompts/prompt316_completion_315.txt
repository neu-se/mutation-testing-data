  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `terminate(cb)` calls the `terminate` function with the `cb` argument, while `cb(null)` simply calls the `cb` function with no arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `terminate(cb)` calls the `terminate` function with the `cb` argument, while `cb(null, data)` calls the `cb` function with two arguments, `null` and `data`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(ended)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `terminate(cb)` calls the `terminate` function with the `cb` argument, while `cb(ended)` calls the `cb` function with the `ended` argument.

DONE.
