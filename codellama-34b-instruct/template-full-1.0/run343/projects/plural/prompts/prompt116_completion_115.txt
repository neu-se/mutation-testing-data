  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
misc + ['bananas']
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code would add an extra item ("bananas") to the list `misc`, which would not be present in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
misc + [3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code would add an extra element (3) to the list `misc`, which would not be present in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
misc + ['dinosorus']
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code would add an extra item ("dinosorus") to the list `misc`, which would not be present in the original code.

DONE.
