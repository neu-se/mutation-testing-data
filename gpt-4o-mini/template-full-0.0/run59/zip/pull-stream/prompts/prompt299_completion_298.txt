Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the callback to be called with `false`, indicating an error or termination, regardless of the actual state of `ended`, which could lead to premature termination of the reading process.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(ended)
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes the current value of `ended` to the callback, which may not be the intended behavior, as it could lead to inconsistent results based on the state of `ended` at that moment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the callback with two `null` arguments, which may not align with the expected data flow, potentially causing downstream logic to fail or behave unexpectedly due to the absence of valid data.

DONE.
