  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function is not optional anymore. In the original code fragment, `done || function () {}` is used to provide a fallback callback function when `done` is not provided. By replacing it with `null`, the program will throw a `TypeError` if `done` is not provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function is not optional anymore. In the original code fragment, `done || function () {}` is used to provide a fallback callback function when `done` is not provided. By replacing it with `undefined`, the program will throw a `TypeError` if `done` is not provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (end, data) {}

This would result in different behavior because the callback function is not optional anymore. In the original code fragment, `done || function () {}` is used to provide a fallback
