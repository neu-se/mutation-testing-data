  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromise(value) || value instanceof Promise
```
This code fragment checks if the value is a promise or an instance of the Promise class. If it is, it returns true, indicating that the value is a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromise(value) && value.isPending()
```
This code fragment checks if the value is a promise and if it is pending. If both conditions are true, it returns true, indicating that the value is a pending promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromise(value) && value.isFulfilled()
```
This code fragment checks if the value is a promise and if it is fulfilled. If both conditions are true, it returns true, indicating that the value is a fulfilled promise.

DONE.
