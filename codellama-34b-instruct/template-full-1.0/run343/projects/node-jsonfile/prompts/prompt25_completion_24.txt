  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content + 'test'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append the string "test" to the content of the file, which would likely cause a JSON parsing error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first character of the content string, which would likely cause a JSON parsing error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the content string to uppercase, which would likely cause a JSON parsing error.

DONE.
