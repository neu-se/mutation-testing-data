  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]o$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag is removed, causing the regular expression to match only lowercase letters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]o$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag is added, causing the regular expression to match all occurrences in the input string, not just the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]o$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag is added, causing the regular expression to match only uppercase letters.

DONE.
