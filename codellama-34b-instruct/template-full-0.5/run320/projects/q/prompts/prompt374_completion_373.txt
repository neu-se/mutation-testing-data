  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.message
```
This would result in different behavior because it would provide a more detailed error message, which could help in debugging and troubleshooting.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.name
```
This would result in different behavior because it would provide the name of the error, which could help in identifying the type of error that occurred.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because it would provide the stack trace of the error, which could help in identifying the location of the error and the sequence of function calls that led to it.

DONE.
