  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.isFulfilled()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFulfilled()` is a method that returns a boolean indicating whether the promise has been resolved or rejected, whereas `resolvedPromise` is a reference to the promise itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because `valueOf()` is a method that returns the value of the promise, whereas `resolvedPromise` is a reference to the promise itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.state
```
This would result in different behavior because `state` is a property that returns a string indicating the current state of the promise, whereas `resolvedPromise` is a reference to the promise itself.

DONE.
