  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the wrong value to the `pull` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the wrong value to the `pull` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an incorrect value to the `pull` function, which would cause it to behave differently.

DONE.
