 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'xeno', 'xenos'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original rule is for a specific string, while the modified rule uses a regular expression that can match other words not intended to be changed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/memo$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' }
