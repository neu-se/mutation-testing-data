  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `abort`, which means that the `if` statement would always evaluate to `false`, even if `abort` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort == false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `==` operator checks for equality, and `abort` is not necessarily `false`. If `abort` is `true`, the `if` statement would evaluate to `false`, even though `abort` is not `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort != true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!=` operator checks for inequality, and `abort` is not necessarily `true`. If `abort` is `false`, the `if` statement would evaluate to `true`, even though `abort` is not `true`.

DONE.
