  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {
    return value;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is not called with the correct number of arguments, which would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {
    return value;
}, function () {
    throw new Error("Rejected");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called with a rejection handler that would throw an error, even if the promise is fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {
    return value;
}, function () {
    return Q.reject(new Error("Rejected"));
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called with a rejection handler that would return a rejected promise, even if the promise is fulfilled.

DONE.
