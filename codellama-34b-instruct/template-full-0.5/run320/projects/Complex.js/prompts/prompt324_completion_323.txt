  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` refers to the variable `a` in the current scope, while the replaced code fragment `b + a` refers to the sum of the variables `b` and `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` refers to the variable `a` in the current scope, while the replaced code fragment `a - b` refers to the difference of the variables `a` and `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` refers to the variable `a` in the current scope, while the replaced code fragment `a * b` refers to the product of the variables `a` and `b`.

DONE.
