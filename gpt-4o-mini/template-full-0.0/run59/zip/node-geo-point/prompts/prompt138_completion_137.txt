Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the latitude value, which would change the adjusted latitude to be one degree higher than the original.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the longitude value instead of the latitude value, which would lead to an incorrect adjustment of the latitude.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude * -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the latitude value, effectively flipping its sign, which would result in an incorrect representation of the geographical point.

DONE.
