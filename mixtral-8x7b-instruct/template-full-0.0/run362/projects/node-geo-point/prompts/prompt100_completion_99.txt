 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
180 / Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the approximate reciprocal of the radians-to-degrees conversion, instead of the actual conversion.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
coordinate.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the longitude instead of converting the radians to degrees.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Math.random() * 360
