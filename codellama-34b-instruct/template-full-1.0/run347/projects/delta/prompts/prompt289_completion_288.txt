  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek` returns the next value in the iteration without advancing the iterator, whereas `next` returns the next value and advances the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `reverse` reverses the order of the elements in the iteration, whereas the original code left the order unchanged.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.partition()
```
This would result in different behavior because `partition` splits the iteration into two parts, whereas the original code left the iteration unchanged.

DONE.
