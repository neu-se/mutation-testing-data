  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, abort, onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is not being called with the correct arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, abort, onAbort()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` function is being called with no arguments, which may cause it to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, abort, onAbort(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` function is being called with a `null` argument, which may cause it to behave differently.

DONE.
