  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(javascript|mailto:|ftp:|file:)/ig.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression now includes the "file:" protocol, which would cause the function to return `null` for any URLs that start with "file:", even if they are valid.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(javascript|mailto:|ftp:|http:)/ig.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression now includes the "http:" protocol, which would cause the function to return `null` for any URLs that start with "http:", even if they are valid.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(javascript|mailto:|ftp:|https:)/ig.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression now includes the "https:" protocol, which would cause the function to return `null` for any URLs that start with "https:", even if they are valid
