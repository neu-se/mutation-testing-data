  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because `clear()` removes all elements from the map, while `delete` only removes a specific element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set(baseUrlStr, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because `set()` adds a new element to the map, while `delete` only removes an existing element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.forEach((value, key) => {
    if (key === baseUrlStr) {
        urlMap.delete(key);
    }
});
```
This would result in different behavior because `forEach()` iterates over the map and checks if the key matches the `baseUrlStr`, if it does, it deletes the element.

DONE.
