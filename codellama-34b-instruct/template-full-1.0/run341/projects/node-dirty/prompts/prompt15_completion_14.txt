  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.push(function() {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed the `cb` function as an argument to `cbs.push()`, while this new code fragment passes a new empty function. This means that the `cb` function would never be called in the mutated code, which could result in the test suite not catching certain errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.push(cb.bind(this));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment simply passed the `cb` function as an argument to `cbs.push()`, while this new code fragment binds the `cb` function to the current `this` context using the `bind()` method. This could change the behavior of the `cb` function within the context in which it is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.push(cb.call(this));
```
This would result in different behavior because the
