  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `acc` is a variable that holds the current value of the reduction, while `acc + 1` would increment the value of `acc` by 1, which could lead to incorrect results in the reduction.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `acc` is a variable that holds the current value of the reduction, while `acc * 2` would double the value of `acc`, which could lead to incorrect results in the reduction.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `acc` is a variable that holds the current value of the reduction, while `acc - 1` would decrement the value of `acc` by 1, which could lead to incorrect results in the reduction.

DONE.
