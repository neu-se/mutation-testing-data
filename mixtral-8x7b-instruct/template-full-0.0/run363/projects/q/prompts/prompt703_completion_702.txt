 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fbound` function would no longer receive any arguments from the call site, and would instead always receive an empty array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fbound` function would receive `null` as its argument, instead of any arguments passed to the function at the call site.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ length: 0 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fbound` function would receive an empty object with a `length` property, instead of any arguments passed to the function at the call site.

These changes would likely cause the tests to fail, as the behavior of the `fbound` function would differ from the original implementation. This would indicate that the current test suite does not adequately cover the edge cases related to the behavior of the `fbound` function. DONE
