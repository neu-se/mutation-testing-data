  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.length
```
This code fragment will return the length of the string, which is not the same as the original code fragment `this, num` which returns the string itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num + 1
```
This code fragment will return the sum of `num` and 1, which is not the same as the original code fragment `this, num` which returns the string itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num * 2
```
This code fragment will return the product of `num` and 2, which is not the same as the original code fragment `this, num` which returns the string itself.

DONE.
