  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply
```
This would result in different behavior because `fapply` is a method that applies a function to a list of arguments, but it does not handle the case where the function is a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method that returns a promise that resolves to the return value of the callback function, but it does not handle the case where the callback function takes arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).ninvoke
```
This would result in different behavior because `ninvoke` is a method that invokes a method on an object with a given set of arguments and returns a promise that resolves to the return value of the method.

DONE.
