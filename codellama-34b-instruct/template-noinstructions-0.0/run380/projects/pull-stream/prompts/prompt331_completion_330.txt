  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(end)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `once` function with the `end` argument, which would cause the `onEnd` callback to be called immediately, rather than waiting for the stream to end.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd(end)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `onEnd` callback with the `end` argument, which would cause the stream to end immediately, rather than waiting for the `once` function to be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cb` function to be called with a `null` value, which would cause the stream to end immediately, rather than waiting for the `once` function to be called.

DONE.
