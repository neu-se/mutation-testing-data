  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the opposite of the original `test(data)` expression. If the `test` function returns true for some input, the original code would return `true`, but the mutated code would return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data) && data.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would require the `data` variable to have a non-zero length, in addition to satisfying the `test` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data) || false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would ignore the result of the `test` function and always return `false`.

DONE.
