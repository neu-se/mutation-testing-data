  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek().length
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.next` returns the next operation from the iterator, while `iter.peek().length` would return the length of the next operation. If the length of the next operation is not the same as the length of the current operation, the behavior of the function would change.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp` is a string, while `iter.next()` returns an object with an `insert` property that contains the string. In the original code, the `insert` property of the current operation is used to determine whether the current operation is an insertion or not. If `thisOp` is used instead of `iter.next()`, the function would not be able to determine whether the current operation is an insertion, and the behavior would change.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp
```
This would result in different behavior
