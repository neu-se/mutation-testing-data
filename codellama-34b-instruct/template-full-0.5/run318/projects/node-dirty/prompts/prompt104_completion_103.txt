  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a method that removes an element from the cache, whereas `set` is a method that updates the value of an existing element or adds a new element to the cache.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.clear
```
This would result in different behavior because `clear` is a method that removes all elements from the cache, whereas `set` is a method that updates the value of an existing element or adds a new element to the cache.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, val + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would update the value of an existing element in the cache, whereas the original code fragment would not update the value of an existing element.

DONE.
