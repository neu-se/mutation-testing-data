  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the iterator to advance by 2 elements instead of 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(thisIter.peekLength() + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the iterator to advance by 1 more element than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(thisIter.peekLength() - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the iterator to advance by 1 fewer element than the original code.

DONE.
