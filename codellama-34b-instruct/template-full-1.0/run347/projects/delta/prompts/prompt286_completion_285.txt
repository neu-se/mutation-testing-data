  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newline + start
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if the current line is a newline, while the replaced code is checking if the current line is a newline and the next line is a start.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newline + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if the current line is a newline, while the replaced code is checking if the current line is a newline and the next line is numerical 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newline, start
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if the current line is a newline, while the replaced code is checking if the current line is a newline and the next line is a start.

DONE.
