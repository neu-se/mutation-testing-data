  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resetUnhandledRejections` function expects an array as an argument, but `null` is not an array. This would cause the function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections([]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resetUnhandledRejections` function expects an array with at least one element, but `[]` is an empty array. This would cause the function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections([1]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resetUnhandledRejections` function expects an array with elements that are promises, but `[1]` is an array with a number. This would cause the function to throw an error.

DONE.
