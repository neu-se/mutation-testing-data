  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the iterator to always move one step further than it should, potentially skipping over important operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the iterator to always move one step backward than it should, potentially missing important operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the iterator to always move twice as far as it should, potentially skipping over important operations.

DONE.
