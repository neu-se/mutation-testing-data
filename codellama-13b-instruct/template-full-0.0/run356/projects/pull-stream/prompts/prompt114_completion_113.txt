  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would not be called with an error argument, which would cause the `reduce` function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would not be called with an error argument, which would cause the `reduce` function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called with an error argument, which would cause the `reduce` function to return a different result.

DONE.
