 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve(answerPs[i]).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve()` creates a new promise that is resolved with the given value, whereas `Q(answerPs[i])` directly creates a promise from the `answerPs[i]` value. If `answerPs[i]` is not a promise, the behavior would differ.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.when(answerPs[i]).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when()` accepts an immediate value or a thunk (a function that returns a promise) and converts it into a promise. If `answerPs[i]` is not a promise, the behavior would differ.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.fcall(function () { return answerPs[i]; }).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fcall()` creates
