  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"1"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Number` to convert the string to a number, while the replacement code fragment uses the string `"1"` directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Number` to convert the string to a number, while the replacement code fragment uses the value `null` directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Number` to convert the string to a number, while the replacement code fragment uses the value `undefined` directly.

DONE.
