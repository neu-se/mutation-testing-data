  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` function to always return `undefined`, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` function to always return the value of `a[key]`, regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` function to always return the value of `b[key]`, regardless of the input.

DONE.
