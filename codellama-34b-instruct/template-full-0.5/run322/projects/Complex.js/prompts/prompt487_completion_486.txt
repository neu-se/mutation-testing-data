  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex.prototype.isFinite = function() {
  return isFinite(this.re) && isFinite(this.im);
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite` method is now defined on the `Complex` prototype, but the original code defines it as a static method on the `Complex` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex.prototype.isInfinite = function() {
  return !(this.isNaN() || this.isFinite());
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is now defined on the `Complex` prototype, but the original code defines it as a static method on the `Complex` class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex.prototype.isNaN = function() {
  return isNaN(this.re) || isNaN(this.im);
};
```
