  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx` is an object with properties, and `undefined` does not have any properties, so the `match` function would return `null` instead of an object with the expected properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an object with properties, and `ctx` is an object with properties, so the `match` function would return `null` instead of an object with the expected properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object, and `ctx` is an object with properties, so the `match` function would return an empty object instead of an object with the expected properties.

DONE.
