  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
hasStacks &&
        promise.stack &&
        typeof error === "object" &&
        error !== null &&
        error.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` variable is not being checked for the correct type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
hasStacks &&
        promise.stack &&
        typeof error === "object" &&
        error !== null &&
        error.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` variable is not being checked for the correct type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
hasStacks &&
        promise.stack &&
        typeof error === "object" &&
        error !== null &&
        error.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` variable is not being checked for the correct type.

DONE.
