  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the square root of the real part of the complex number, rather than the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the square root of the imaginary part of the complex number plus one, rather than the imaginary part itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the square root of twice the imaginary part of the complex number, rather than the imaginary part itself.

DONE.
