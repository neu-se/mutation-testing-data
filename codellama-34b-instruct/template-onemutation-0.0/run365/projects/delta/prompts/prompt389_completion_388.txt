  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekLength` is a method that returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, while `otherIter.peekLength()` is a method call that returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, but also increments the iterator to the next operation.

DONE.
