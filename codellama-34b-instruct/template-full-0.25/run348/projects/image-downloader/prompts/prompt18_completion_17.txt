  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest, basename
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the raw basename of the URL, without decoding it, which could lead to unexpected results if the URL contains non-ASCII characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(options.dest), decodedBasename
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the directory name of the destination file, rather than the file name itself, which could lead to unexpected results if the destination file is not in the same directory as the source file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename(options.dest), decodedBasename
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the basename of the destination file, rather than the file name itself, which could lead to unexpected results if the destination file is not in the same directory as the source file.

DONE.
