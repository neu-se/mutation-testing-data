  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `inverted.delete` would delete the entire delta, whereas `inverted.retain` would retain only the specified attributes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.retain(Op.length(op), {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `inverted.retain(Op.length(op), {})` would retain the entire delta with no attributes, whereas `inverted.retain` with the original attributes would retain the attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.retain(Op.length(op), { [embedType]: handler.invert(opData, baseOpData) })
```
This would result in different behavior because `inverted.retain(Op.length(op), { [embedType]: handler.invert(opData, baseOpData) })` would retain the entire
