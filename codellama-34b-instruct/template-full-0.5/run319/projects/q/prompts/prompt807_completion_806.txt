  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` returns a promise that is already rejected, whereas `Q` returns a promise that is pending.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when` returns a promise that is resolved with the given value, whereas `Q` returns a promise that is pending.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.delay
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.delay` returns a promise that is resolved with the given value after a delay, whereas `Q` returns a promise that is pending.

DONE.
