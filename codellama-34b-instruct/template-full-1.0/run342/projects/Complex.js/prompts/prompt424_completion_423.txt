  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `!` operator would negate the expression and the `if` statement would always be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'] && this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `&&` operator would ensure that `if` statement is only executed when `this['isInfinite']` is not only truthy but also strictly equal to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] = Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of `this['im']` to `Infinity` before executing the `return` statement, making the `return` statement return a different value.

DONE.
