  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options` is an object, and the new code fragment `null` is a primitive value. In the original code, the `options` object is used to specify the encoding for the file, but with the new code fragment, the `null` value would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options` is an object, and the new code fragment `undefined` is a primitive value. In the original code, the `options` object is used to specify the encoding for the file, but with the new code fragment, the `undefined` value would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ encoding: 'utf8' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options` is an object, and the new code fragment `{ encoding: 'utf8' }` is a different object with
