  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method creates a new array by concatenating two or more arrays, while the `slice` method returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.splice
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method creates a new array by concatenating two or more arrays, while the `splice` method changes the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing elements and/or adding new elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.push
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method creates a new array by concatenating two or more arrays, while the `push` method adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array.

DONE.
