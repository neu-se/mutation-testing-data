  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because the unary minus operator would negate the value of `a`, causing the expression `Math.sin(a) * cosh(b)` to evaluate to a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition operator would add 1 to the value of `a`, causing the expression `Math.sin(a) * cosh(b)` to evaluate to a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operator would multiply the value of `a` by the value of `b`, causing the expression `Math.sin(a) * cosh(b)` to evaluate to a different result.

DONE.
