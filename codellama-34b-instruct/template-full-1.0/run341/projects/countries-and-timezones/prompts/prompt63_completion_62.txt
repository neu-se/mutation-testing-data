  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, "wrong_id"
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would receive a wrong input, and the buildCountry function would return a different country.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, id
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would receive a null value for the data parameter, and the buildCountry function would return an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would receive a random number as the id, and the buildCountry function would return a different country.

DONE.
