  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because 0 is a constant, and replacing 2 with 0 would cause the exponent to evaluate to 0, which would make the entire expression evaluate to 0, regardless of the value of `zoom`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-2
```
This would result in different behavior because -2 is also a constant, and replacing 2 with -2 would make the exponent evaluate to -4, which would cause the entire expression to evaluate to a different value than it did with 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the exponent based on the value of `zoom`, which could cause the entire expression to evaluate to a different value than it did with 2.

DONE.
