  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule[0]` is the regular expression that matches the word, whereas `rule[1]` is the replacement string or function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule[2]` is the function that is called to perform the replacement, whereas `rule[1]` is the replacement string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule[3]` is the function that is called to perform the replacement, whereas `rule[1]` is the replacement string.

DONE.
