  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.constants.W_OK` is the constant for write permission, while `fs.constants.R_OK` is the constant for read permission.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, fs.constants.X_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.constants.X_OK` is the constant for execute permission, which is not relevant to the context of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, fs.constants.F_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.constants.F_OK` is the constant for existence of a file or directory, which is not relevant to the context of the code.

DONE.
