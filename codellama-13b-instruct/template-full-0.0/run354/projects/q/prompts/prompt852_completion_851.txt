  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` variable would be `null` instead of an `Error` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` variable would be `undefined` instead of an `Error` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("Test error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` variable would be a new `Error` object with the message "Test error" instead of the original `Error` object.

DONE.
