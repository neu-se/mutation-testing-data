  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice() method uses an index-based approach to extract a portion of a string, and by setting the first argument to 1, the function would only extract the first character of the word, regardless of whether it ends in a consonant or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice() method uses an index-based approach to extract a portion of a string, and by setting the first argument to word.length - 1, the function would only extract the last character of the word, regardless of whether it ends in a consonant or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(word.length / 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice() method uses an index-based approach to extract a portion of a string, and by setting the first argument to Math.floor(word.length /
