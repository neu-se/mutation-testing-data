  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `split` without an argument splits the string at each character, while `split` with an argument splits the string at each occurrence of the argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split(':')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the string at each occurrence of the colon character, while the original code splits the string at each slash character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('+')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the string at each occurrence of the plus character, while the original code splits the string at each slash character.

DONE.
