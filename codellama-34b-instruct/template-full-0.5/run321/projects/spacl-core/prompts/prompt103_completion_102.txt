  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, ctx.foo
```
This would result in different behavior because the `foo` property is not defined on the `ctx` object, which would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, ctx.bar
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bar` property is not defined on the `ctx` object, which would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, ctx.baz
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baz` property is not defined on the `ctx` object, which would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
