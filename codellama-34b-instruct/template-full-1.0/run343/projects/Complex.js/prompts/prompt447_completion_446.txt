  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the product of the imaginary part and the places instead of the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] / places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the division of the real part by the places instead of the product.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] ** places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the exponential of the real part to the power of places instead of the product.

DONE.
