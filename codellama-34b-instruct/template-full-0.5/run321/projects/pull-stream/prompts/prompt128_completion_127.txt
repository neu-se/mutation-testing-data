  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `true`, which means that the function would always return `null` if `i > max`. By replacing it with `false`, the function would always return `cb(null, i++)` instead, which could cause the test suite to fail if it relies on the function returning `null` in certain cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < max
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `i > max`, which means that the function would return `cb(null, i++)` if `i` was greater than `max`. By replacing it with `i < max`, the function would return `cb(null, i++)` if `i` was less than or equal to `max`, which could cause the test suite to fail if it relies on the function returning `null` in certain cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max - i
```
