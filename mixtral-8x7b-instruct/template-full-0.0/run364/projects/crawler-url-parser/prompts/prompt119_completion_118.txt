 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gettype` function would always return "external" when the `pageurl` is passed as the second argument, regardless of the `linkurl`. This is because the falsy value of `baseUrl` would cause the `pageurl.host == linkurl.host` condition to always be false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gettype` function would throw a TypeError when the `pageurl` is passed as the second argument, since `pageurl` would be `null` and it would not have a `host` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
