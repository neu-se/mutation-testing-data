  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the value of `PLACEHOLDER` to determine the length of the slice. If `PLACEHOLDER` is replaced with `0`, the slice will always be empty, even if the `other.ops` array is not empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the value of `PLACEHOLDER` to determine the length of the slice. If `PLACEHOLDER` is replaced with `-1`, the slice will always be one element shorter than the original array, even if the `other.ops` array is empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the value of `PLACEHOLDER` to determine the length of the slice. If `PLACEHOLDER`
