 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
eval
```
This would result in different behavior because `eval` can execute arbitrary code, which is a security risk and has different behavior than the original `JSON.parse`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Function
```
This would result in different behavior because `new Function` can also execute arbitrary code, which is a security risk and has different behavior than the original `JSON.parse`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
require('json-stable-stringify').parse
```
This would result in different behavior because `require('json-stable-stringify').parse` sorts the keys of the JSON object before parsing, which can lead to different object structures compared to the original `JSON.parse`.

DONE.
