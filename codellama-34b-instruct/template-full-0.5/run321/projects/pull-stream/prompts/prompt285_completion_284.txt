  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls `cb` with one argument, while this new code fragment calls it with two arguments. This could potentially cause the test suite to pass even if the `map` function is not working correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls `cb` with one argument, while this new code fragment calls it with zero arguments. This could potentially cause the test suite to pass even if the `map` function is not working correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls `cb` with one argument, while this new code fragment calls it with two null arguments. This could potentially cause the test suite to pass even if the `map` function is not working correctly.

DONE.
