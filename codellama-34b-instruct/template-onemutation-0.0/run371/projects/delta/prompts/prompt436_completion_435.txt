  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `nextOp.delete` is a number, while the new code fragment checks if `nextOp.retain` is a number. This change would cause the code to behave differently if `nextOp.retain` is a number, as it would return a different value in the `retain` property of the `retOp` object.

DONE.
