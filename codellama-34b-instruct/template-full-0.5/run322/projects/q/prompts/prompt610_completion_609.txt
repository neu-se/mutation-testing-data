  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("get", [key])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `dispatch` method on the `Q` object, which is not the same as calling the `dispatch` method on the `object` itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.dispatch(object, "get", [key])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `dispatch` method on the `Q` object, which is not the same as calling the `dispatch` method on the `object` itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.dispatch("get", [key])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `dispatch` method on the `object` itself, which is not the same as calling the `dispatch` method on the `Q` object.

DONE.
