  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would change the value of `a`, which is used in the calculation of `d` and `t2`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would change the value of `b`, which is used in the calculation of `d` and `t2`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* b` would change the value of `a`, which is used in the calculation of `d` and `t2`.

DONE.
