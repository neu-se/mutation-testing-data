  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(null, end)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `done` callback with a `null` error and the `end` value, rather than just the `end` value as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(end, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `done` callback with the `end` value as the error, rather than the `end` value as the data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `done` callback with both the `error` and `data` arguments set to `null`, rather than just the `end` value as in the original code.

DONE.
