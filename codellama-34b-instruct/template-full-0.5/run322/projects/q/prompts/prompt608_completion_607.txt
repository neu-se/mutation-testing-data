  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[args]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` variable is not defined in the current scope, and would cause a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a slice of the `args` array, rather than the array itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `args` array with the value `1`, rather than passing the array itself.

DONE.
