  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = 'buggy string';
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `newOp`, which is an object with properties `insert`, `attributes`, and `retain`. By replacing it with a string, the code would no longer be able to access those properties and would likely throw an error.
