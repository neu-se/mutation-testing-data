 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ message: 'An error occurred' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function would now return an object instead of an error, which might not be properly handled in the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Error('An error occurred')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function would now return a different instance of an Error object, which might not be properly compared in the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { throw new Error('An error occurred') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function would now return a function that throws an error, which might not be properly handled in the test suite.

DONE.
