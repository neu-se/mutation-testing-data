  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return the value associated with the next key in the map, rather than the value associated with the specified key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return the value associated with the previous key in the map, rather than the value associated with the specified key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return the value associated with the key that is twice the specified key, rather than the value associated with the specified key.

DONE.
