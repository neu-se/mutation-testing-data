 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
final && min <= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flatten` function would not be called when `min` is 0, which can lead to incorrect regex generation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
final || opt && min < 1
