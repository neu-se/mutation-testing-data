  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment retrieves the text content of the anchor element, while this replacement retrieves the value of the href attribute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).parent().text()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment retrieves the text content of the anchor element, while this replacement retrieves the text content of the parent element of the anchor element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).find('a').text()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment retrieves the text content of the anchor element, while this replacement retrieves the text content of the first anchor element within the anchor element.

DONE.
