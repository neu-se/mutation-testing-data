  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, []
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `cbs` variable, which is a list of callbacks, while the new code fragment uses an empty array, which would not have the same effect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `cbs` variable, which is a list of callbacks, while the new code fragment uses `null`, which would not have the same effect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `cbs` variable, which is a list of callbacks, while the new code fragment uses `undefined`, which would not have the same effect.

DONE.
