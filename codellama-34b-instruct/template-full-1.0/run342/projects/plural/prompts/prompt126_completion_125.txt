  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num === 1
```
This would result in the `if` statement always evaluating to `true`, even when `num` is `0` or any other non-`1` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num > 1
```
This would result in the `if` statement never evaluating to `true`, as `num` can never be greater than `1` when it is `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!num || num === 0
```
This would result in the `if` statement always evaluating to `false`, as `num` is always truthy when it is `undefined`.
