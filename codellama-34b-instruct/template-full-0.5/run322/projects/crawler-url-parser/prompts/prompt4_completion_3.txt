  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr && _has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the base URL for illegal characters instead of the current URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!currentUrlStr || _has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `null` if the current URL is empty or contains illegal characters, instead of only returning `null` if the current URL contains illegal characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr != baseUrlStr && _has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if the current URL contains illegal characters if it is different from the base URL, instead of always checking the current URL.

DONE.
