  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeTimezone
```
This would result in different behavior because `memoizeTimezone` is a different function than `memoizeCountry`, and it would cause the `getCountry` function to memoize timezones instead of countries.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `function() {}` is a different function than `memoizeCountry`, and it would cause the `getCountry` function to do nothing instead of memoizing countries.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `memoizeCountry`, and it would cause the `getCountry` function to return `null` instead of a country object.

DONE.
