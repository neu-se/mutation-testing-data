 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument of `apply` should be the `this` value for the function call, and `null` is not a valid `this` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
5
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument of `apply` should be the `this` value for the function call, and a number is not a valid `this` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument of `apply` should be the `this` value for the function call, and an arrow function is not a valid `this` value.

DONE.
