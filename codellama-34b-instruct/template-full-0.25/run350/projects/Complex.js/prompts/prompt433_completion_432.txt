  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because the `re` property is the real part of the complex number, and multiplying it by `places` would result in a different value than multiplying the imaginary part by `places`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because adding 1 to the result of multiplying the imaginary part by `places` would result in a different value than multiplying the imaginary part by `places` alone.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * this['im'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because multiplying the real and imaginary parts of the complex number by `places` would result in a different value than multiplying the imaginary part by `places` alone.

DONE.
