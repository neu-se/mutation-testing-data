  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [key + 1]: tzs[key] }
```
This would result in different behavior because the new key would be one greater than the original, which could cause the map to skip over some data points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [key * 2]: tzs[key] }
```
This would result in different behavior because the new key would be double the original, which could cause the map to skip over some data points.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [key]: tzs[key + 1] }
```
This would result in different behavior because the new key would be one greater than the original, which could cause the map to skip over some data points.

DONE.
