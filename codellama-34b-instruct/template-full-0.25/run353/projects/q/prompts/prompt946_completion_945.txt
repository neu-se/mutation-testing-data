  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` function expects a function as its argument, but `null` is being passed instead. This would cause an error to be thrown when the `deferred.resolve` method is called, which would result in the promise being rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` function expects a function as its argument, but an empty function is being passed instead. This would cause the `deferred.resolve` method to be called with an empty function as its argument, which would result in the promise being resolved with an empty function instead of the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(function(error) {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` function expects a function
