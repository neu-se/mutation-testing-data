  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `thenReject` method to immediately resolve with an empty array, rather than returning a rejected promise with the original reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `thenReject` method to immediately resolve with `null`, rather than returning a rejected promise with the original reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `thenReject` method to return a rejected promise with the original reason, rather than immediately resolving with an empty array.

DONE.
