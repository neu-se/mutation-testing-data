  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherData(index)
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherData(index)` would attempt to call `otherData` as a function, which could throw a `TypeError` if `otherData` is not a function or does not support this usage.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherData.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the `otherData` object, which is not necessarily the same as the length of the `length` property of the object returned by `otherData`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherData.ops[index]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `index`-th element of the `ops` array of `otherData`, which is not necessarily the same as the `index`-th element of the `ops` array of the object returned by `otherData`.

DONE.
