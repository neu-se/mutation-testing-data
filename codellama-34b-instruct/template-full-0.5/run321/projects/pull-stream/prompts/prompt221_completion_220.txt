  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a non-null value, and replacing it with `null` would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a defined value, and replacing it with `undefined` would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a non-empty object, and replacing it with an empty object `{}` would cause the function to return a different value.

DONE.
