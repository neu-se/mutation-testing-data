  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str + "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append the string "foo" to the original string, which would cause the JSON parsing to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the string to uppercase, which would cause the JSON parsing to fail if the JSON object contains any keys or values that are not uppercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.split("")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the string into an array of individual characters, which would cause the JSON parsing to fail.

DONE.
