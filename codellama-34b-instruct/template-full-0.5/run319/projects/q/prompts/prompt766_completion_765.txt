  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `noop` is a function that does nothing, while `null` is a primitive value that represents the absence of any object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `noop` is a function that does nothing, while `undefined` is a primitive value that represents an uninitialized or non-existent variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Dummy error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `noop` is a function that does nothing, while `throw new Error("Dummy error")` is a statement that throws an error, which would cause the promise to be rejected.

DONE.
