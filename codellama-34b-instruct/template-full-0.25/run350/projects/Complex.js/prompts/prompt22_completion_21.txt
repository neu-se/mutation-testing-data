  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0, regardless of the values of `a` and `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0, regardless of the values of `a` and `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 1, regardless of the values of `a` and `b`.

DONE.
