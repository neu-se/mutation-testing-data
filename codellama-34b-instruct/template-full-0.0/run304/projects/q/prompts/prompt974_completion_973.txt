  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects an object, but `null` is a primitive value that does not have properties or methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects an object, but `undefined` is a primitive value that does not have properties or methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects an object with properties and methods, but `{}` is an empty object that does not have any properties or methods.

DONE.
