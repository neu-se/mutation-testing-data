  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
oink;
```
This would result in different behavior because "oink" is not a valid event name for the "output" stream, and would cause the code to error out.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'different', resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the event name triggered by the "output" stream from "error" to "different", which would cause the code to respond differently to errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finish'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the event name triggered by the "output" stream from "error" to "finish", which would cause the code to respond differently to errors.

DONE.
