  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'people'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'person'`, which would result in the plural form of the word being `'people'`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'peoples'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'person'`, which would result in the plural form of the word being `'people'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'persons'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'person'`, which would result in the plural form of the word being `'people'`.

DONE.
