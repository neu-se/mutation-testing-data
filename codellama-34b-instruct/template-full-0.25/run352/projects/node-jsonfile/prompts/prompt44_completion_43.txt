  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.encoding` is a different object property than `options`, and it may not be defined in all cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.encoding = 'utf8'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `encoding` property of `options` to `'utf8'`, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.encoding = 'utf16'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `encoding` property of `options` to `'utf16'`, which is a different encoding than the default `'utf8'`.

DONE.
