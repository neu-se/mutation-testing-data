 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the current object, while `[]` is an empty array, which would cause an error in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the current object, while `null` is a primitive value that does not have any properties or methods, which would cause an error in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the current object, while `0` is a number, which does not have any properties or methods, which would cause an error in the code.

DONE.
