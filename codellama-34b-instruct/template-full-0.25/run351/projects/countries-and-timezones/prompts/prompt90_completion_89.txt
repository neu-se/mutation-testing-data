  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzName + options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `tzName` and `options` variables, which is not the intended behavior of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options[tzName]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the `tzName` property of the `options` object, which is not the intended behavior of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzName.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the characters in the `tzName` string, which is not the intended behavior of the function.

DONE.
