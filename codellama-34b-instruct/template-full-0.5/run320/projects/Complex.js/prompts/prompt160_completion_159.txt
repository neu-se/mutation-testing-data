  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is called on the `Complex` object `z`, which is not the same as calling `isInfinite` on `this`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is applied to the result of `isInfinite`, which would invert the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method is called on `this`, which is not the same as calling `isInfinite`.

DONE.
