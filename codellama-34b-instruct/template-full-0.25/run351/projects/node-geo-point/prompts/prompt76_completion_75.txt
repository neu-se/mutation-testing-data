  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(θ)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor()` rounds a number down to the nearest integer, whereas `Number()` converts a value to a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ.toFixed(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `toFixed()` rounds a number to a specified number of decimal places, whereas `Number()` converts a value to a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `toString()` converts a number to a string, whereas `Number()` converts a value to a number.

DONE.
