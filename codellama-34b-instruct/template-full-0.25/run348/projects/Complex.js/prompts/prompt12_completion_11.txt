  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-y
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the sign of the second argument to `Math.exp()`, which would alter the result of the expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the expression to be evaluated as `Math.exp(x) - Math.exp(x)`, which would always result in 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the expression to be evaluated as `Math.exp(x) - Math.exp(x + 1)`, which would always result in a non-zero value.

DONE.
