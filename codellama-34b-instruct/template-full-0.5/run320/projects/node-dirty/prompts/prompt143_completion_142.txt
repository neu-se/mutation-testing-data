  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a null error instead of the actual error that occurred, which could cause the test to pass even if there was an error in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error('Different error message')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a different error message than the original code, which could cause the test to fail if it is not expecting the new error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', 'different error type'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a different type of error than the original code, which could cause the test to fail if it is not expecting the new error type.

DONE.
