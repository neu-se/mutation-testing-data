  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.concat(item)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method returns a new array, rather than mutating the existing one like `push`. Therefore, the `reduce` function would not accumulate the items correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.push(item * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method is called with a different value than the original code. For example, if the original array is `[1, 2, 3]`, the mutated array would be `[1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 6]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.push(item + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method is called with a different value than the original code. For example, if the original array is `[1, 2, 3]`, the mutated array would be `[1,
