  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `true` value would always be returned, regardless of the input stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` value would always be returned, regardless of the input stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would always be returned, regardless of the input stream.

DONE.
