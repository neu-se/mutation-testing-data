 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan` only takes one argument, while `atan2` takes two arguments and considers the signs of both arguments to find the correct quadrant of the result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan2(y, -x)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the sign of the second argument, which would result in a bearing that is 180 degrees off from the correct bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan2(x, y)
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the order of the arguments, which would result in a bearing that is 90 degrees off from the correct bearing.

DONE.
