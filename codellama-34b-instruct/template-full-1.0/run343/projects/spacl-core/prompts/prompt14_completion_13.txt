  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.+\/$/).length !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property is being checked instead of just comparing the result of `match` to `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.+\/$/) [0] !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the first element of the array returned by `match` is being checked instead of just comparing the result of `match` to `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.+\/$/).includes('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `includes` method is being used instead of just comparing the result of `match` to `null`.

DONE.
