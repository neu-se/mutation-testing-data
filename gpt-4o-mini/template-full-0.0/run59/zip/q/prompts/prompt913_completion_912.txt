Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `slice` method of the `arguments` object, which returns a shallow copy of the entire `arguments` object instead of converting it to an array, potentially leading to unexpected results when the function is called with a different number of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.from(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.from(arguments)` creates a new array from the `arguments` object, which may not behave the same way as `array_slice`, especially if `array_slice` has specific handling for the input that `Array.from` does not replicate.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[].concat(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because using `[].concat(arguments)` attempts to concatenate the `arguments` object into a new array, which may lead to a nested array structure if `arguments` contains multiple arguments, unlike `array_slice` which flattens the input.

DONE.
