  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise` is a valid function in the context of the code, whereas `newPromise` is not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a valid function in the context of the code, whereas `newPromise, message` is not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfill
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill` is a valid function in the context of the code, whereas `newPromise, message` is not.

DONE.
