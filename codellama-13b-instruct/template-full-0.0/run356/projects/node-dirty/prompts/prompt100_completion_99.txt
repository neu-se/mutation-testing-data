  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(`Could not load corrupted row: ${rowStr}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be more specific and provide more information about the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(`Could not load corrupted row: ${rowStr}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be more specific and provide more information about the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(`Could not load corrupted row: ${rowStr}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be more specific and provide more information about the error.

DONE.
