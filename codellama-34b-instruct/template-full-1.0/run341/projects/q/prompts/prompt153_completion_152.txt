  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.reverse().join('\n')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the stacks in reverse order, which would change the order of the frames in the final stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.filter(function(stack) { return stack.indexOf('q') === -1; }).join('\n')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove any stacks that contain the letter 'q', which would eliminate any frames that are part of the Q library.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.map(function(stack) { return stack.trim(); }).join('\n')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would trim any whitespace from the beginning and end of each stack, which would remove any trailing or leading whitespace in the final stack trace.

DONE.
