  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b == 1
```
This would result in different behavior because b being equal to 1 instead of -1 would cause the function to produce a different result for the logarithm, which would then affect the rest of the calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b == 2
```
This would result in different behavior because b being equal to 2 would cause the function to produce a different result for the logarithm, which would then affect the rest of the calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because b being greater than 1 would cause the function to produce a different result for the logarithm, which would then affect the rest of the calculations.

DONE.
