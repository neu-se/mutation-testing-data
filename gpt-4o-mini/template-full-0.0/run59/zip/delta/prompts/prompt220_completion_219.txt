Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks specifically for `undefined`, which would allow `null` values to pass through, potentially leading to incorrect handling of operations that should be considered as having an insert value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `op.insert` is strictly equal to `false`, which would ignore any truthy values (including non-null strings) and incorrectly treat them as if they were not inserts.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses loose equality to check for both `null` and `undefined`, which could lead to unintended consequences if `op.insert` is a falsy value like an empty string or zero, thus misclassifying valid insert operations.

DONE.
