  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(<empty>)
```
This would result in different behavior because "void 0" is an empty value, while "args" is a reference to the function's argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because "void 0" is an empty value, while "undefined" is the absence of any value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because "void 0" is an empty value, while "0" is a specific numerical value.

DONE.
