  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil` will round up the result to the next highest integer, whereas `Math.floor` rounds down to the next lowest integer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.round` will round the result to the nearest integer, whereas `Math.floor` and `Math.ceil` will round down and round up respectively.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() + 10
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` generates a random number between 0 and 1, so adding 10 to it will make it always return a positive number, whereas `Math.floor` and `Math.ceil` can return both positive and negative numbers depending on the input.

DONE.
