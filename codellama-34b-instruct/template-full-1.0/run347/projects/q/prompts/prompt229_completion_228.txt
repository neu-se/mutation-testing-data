  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
operands[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `resolve` is called with all of `args`, but here we only call it with the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
operands[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `resolve` is called with all of `args`, but here we only call it with the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `resolve` is called with all of `args`, but here we call it with an empty array.

DONE.
