  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('car', 'cars')
```
This would result in different behavior because the input word "car" no longer matches the regular expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('riddle', 'riddles')
```
This would result in different behavior because the input word "riddle" is not included in the list of exceptions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('suit', 'suits')
```
This would result in different behavior because the input word "suit" is not included in the list of exceptions.

DONE.
