  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would not be called with the `true` value for the `decodeURI` parameter, which would cause the URL to not be decoded.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would not be called with a value for the `decodeURI` parameter, which would cause the URL to be decoded by default.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would be called with the `currentUrlStr` argument, which would cause the URL to be parsed differently than if the `true` value was passed as the `decodeURI` parameter.

DONE.
