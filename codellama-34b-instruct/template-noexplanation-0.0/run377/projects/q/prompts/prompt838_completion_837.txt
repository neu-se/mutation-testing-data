  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(null, onUnhandledError);
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it passes `null` as the first argument to `then`, which is the fulfillment handler. This means that the promise will be resolved with the original value, and the `onUnhandledError` function will only be called if the promise is rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(onUnhandledError, null);
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it passes `null` as the second argument to `then`, which is the rejection handler. This means that the promise will be rejected with the original reason, and the `onUnhandledError` function will only be called if the promise is fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {
    onUnhandledError();
});
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but
