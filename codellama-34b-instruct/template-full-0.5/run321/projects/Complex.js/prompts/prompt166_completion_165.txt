  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is not being called on the correct object. In the original code, `this` refers to the `Complex` object, but in this modified code, `a` is being passed as the object to the `isInfinite` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](z)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is being called on the `z` object instead of the `Complex` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is being called on the `z` object instead of the `Complex` object, and the `()` operator is being used instead of the `[]` operator.

DONE.
