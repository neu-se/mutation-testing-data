  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, point.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the bearing between the longitude of the current point and the longitude of the destination point, instead of the bearing between the current point and the destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point, this.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the bearing between the current point and the destination point, but using the longitude of the current point instead of the longitude of the destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude, point.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the bearing between the latitude of the current point and the longitude of the destination point, instead of the bearing between the current point and the destination point.

DONE.
