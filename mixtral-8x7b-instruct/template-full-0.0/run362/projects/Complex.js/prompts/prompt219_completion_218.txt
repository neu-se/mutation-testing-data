 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the imaginary part of the result is flipped, which can cause incorrect results in subsequent calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by `b` is skipped, which can cause incorrect results in subsequent calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by `b` is replaced with a constant `1`, which can cause incorrect results in subsequent calculations.

DONE.
