  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(attributes).filter(k => attributes[k] !== undefined).length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Object.keys(attributes).length` to check if the `attributes` object is empty, but this new code fragment uses `filter()` to remove any `undefined` values from the keys array before checking its length. This could cause the test to pass or fail depending on the specific data being tested.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(attributes).some(k => attributes[k] === undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Object.keys(attributes).length` to check if the `attributes` object is empty, but this new code fragment uses `some()` to check if any of the keys are `undefined`. This could cause the test to pass or fail depending on the specific data being tested.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(attributes).every(k
