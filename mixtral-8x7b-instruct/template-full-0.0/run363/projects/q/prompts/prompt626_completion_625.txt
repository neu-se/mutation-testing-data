 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.promiseDispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a bound function, changing the context of `this` within `promiseDispatch`. The bound function will always have the original `this` value, even when called in a different context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.promiseDispatch.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly sets the context of `this` to `null` within `promiseDispatch`. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the method relies on accessing properties or methods of the original object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { this.promiseDispatch(deferred.resolve, op, args); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new function, which could lead to issues with closures and variable scoping. Additionally, the new function does not have access to the original `this
