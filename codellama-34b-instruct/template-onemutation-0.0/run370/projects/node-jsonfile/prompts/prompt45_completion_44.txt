  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, options.reviver
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` function is not called in the original code fragment, but it is called in the modified code fragment. The `reviver` function is used to transform the data after it has been parsed, and it is passed as an option to the `JSON.parse()` method. By including `options.reviver` in the modified code fragment, we are ensuring that the `reviver` function is called, which could result in different behavior if the function has side effects or if it modifies the data in some way.

DONE.
