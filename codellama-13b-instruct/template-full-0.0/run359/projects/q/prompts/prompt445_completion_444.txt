  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection", reason, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would trigger the "unhandledRejection" event when a promise is rejected, which would cause the program to crash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection", reason, promise, "error"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would trigger the "unhandledRejection" event with an additional argument "error" when a promise is rejected, which would cause the program to crash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection", reason, promise, "error", "stack"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would trigger the "unhandledRejection" event with an additional argument "error" and "stack" when a promise is rejected, which would cause the program to crash.

DONE.
