  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment logs the value of `data`, while this modified code fragment logs the value of `data + 1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment logs the value of `data`, while this modified code fragment logs the length of `data`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment logs the value of `data`, while this modified code fragment logs the first element of `data`.

DONE.
