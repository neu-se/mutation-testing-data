 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` identifier would be re-bound to the global `Math.cos` function, which could lead to different behavior if the code relies on the `cos` variable being the local `deg2rad` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` identifier would be re-bound to the global `Math.sin` function, which would cause the calculation of `sinφ2` to use the sine function instead of the cosine function, leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'constantString'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` identifier would be re-bound to a string literal, which would cause a TypeError when attempting to invoke it as a function in the calculation of `sinφ2`.

DONE.
