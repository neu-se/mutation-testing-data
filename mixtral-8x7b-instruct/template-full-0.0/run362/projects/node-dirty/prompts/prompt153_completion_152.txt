 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` is not a method that exists on a writable stream, and attempting to call it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork(); this._queue.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would clear the `_queue` after uncorking the stream, which would cause any pending writes to be discarded.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork(); this._inFlightWrites = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reset the `_inFlightWrites` counter after uncorking the stream, which would cause the `drain` event to be emitted prematurely.

DONE.
