  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` and `b` are different variables.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 to `a` would change the output of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication of `a` by 2 would change the output of the function.

DONE.
