  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1 + <randomNumber>
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a random number to the longitude value, potentially causing the calculated destination to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(λ1 * <randomNumber>) % 360
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the longitude value by a random number and then take the result modulo 360, potentially causing the calculated destination to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<randomNumber> * Math.sin(λ1 * Math.PI / 180)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the sine function to generate a random number that is proportional to the longitude value, potentially causing the calculated destination to be incorrect.

DONE.
