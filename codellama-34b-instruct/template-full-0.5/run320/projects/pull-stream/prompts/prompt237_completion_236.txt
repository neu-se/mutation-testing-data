  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call, while `null` is a null value and would not call the `cb` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call, while `undefined` is a variable that has not been declared or assigned a value, and would throw a reference error if used as a function call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call, while `console.log` is a function that logs a message to the console, and would not call the `cb` function.

DONE.
