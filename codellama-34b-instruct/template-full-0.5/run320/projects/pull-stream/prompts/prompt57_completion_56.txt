  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.push(item + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushes the item as is, while this mutation pushes the item plus 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.push(item - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushes the item as is, while this mutation pushes the item minus 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.push(item * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushes the item as is, while this mutation pushes the item multiplied by 2.

DONE.
