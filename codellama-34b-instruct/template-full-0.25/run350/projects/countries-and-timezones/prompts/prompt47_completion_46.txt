  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id, options, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `null` argument would cause the `getCountry` function to return `null` instead of a country object, which would break the `getTimezonesForCountry` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id, options, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `undefined` argument would cause the `getCountry` function to return `undefined` instead of a country object, which would break the `getTimezonesForCountry` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id, options, {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `{}` argument would cause the `getCountry` function to return an empty object instead of a country object, which would break the `getTimezonesForCountry` function.

DONE.
