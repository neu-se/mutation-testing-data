  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString` is a different method than `Object.prototype.valueOf`, which is what the original code fragment `obj` would have called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.valueOf` is a different method than `Object.prototype.toString`, which is what the original code fragment `obj` would have called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.toString().toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `obj` would have returned the string representation of the object, without converting it to lowercase.

DONE.
