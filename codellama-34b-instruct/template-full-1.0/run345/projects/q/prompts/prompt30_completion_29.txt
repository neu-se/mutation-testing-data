  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` removes the last element of the queue, while `shift()` removes the first element. If the code is relying on the last element being removed, it will behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.splice(0,1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice()` modifies the queue in place, removing the first element, while `pop()` and `shift()` create a new array without the removed element. If the code is relying on the original array being modified, it will behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` creates a new array without the first element, while `pop()` and `shift()` modify the original array. If the code is relying on the original array being modified, it will behave differently.
