  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!nodeback
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the value of `nodeback`, potentially causing the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add 1 to the value of `nodeback`, potentially causing the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call()` method would be called on `nodeback`, potentially causing the code to behave differently.

DONE.
