  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(result.value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `result.value` is not wrapped in a promise, which could cause issues if the value is not a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(result.value).then(function (value) {
    return value;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `result.value` is wrapped in a promise, which could cause issues if the value is already a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(result.value).then(function (value) {
    return value;
}, function (error) {
    return error;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `result.value` is wrapped in a promise, and the error is also handled.

DONE.
