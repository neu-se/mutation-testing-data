  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ filename: dest, encoding: 'utf8' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `encoding` option is not present in the original code fragment, which means that the file will be written in the default encoding, which may not be the same as the encoding used in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ filename: dest, flags: 'w' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flags` option is not present in the original code fragment, which means that the file will be written in the default mode, which may not be the same as the mode used in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ filename: dest, mode: 0o666 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `mode` option is not present in the original code fragment, which means that the file will be written with the default mode, which may not be the same as the mode used in the original
