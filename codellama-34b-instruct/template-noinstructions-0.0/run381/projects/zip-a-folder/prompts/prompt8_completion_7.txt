  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath !== src
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality, while this replacement checks for inequality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.includes(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for exact equality, while this replacement checks if `src` is a substring of `targetBasePath`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!targetBasePath.startsWith(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for exact equality, while this replacement checks if `src` is not a prefix of `targetBasePath`.

DONE.
