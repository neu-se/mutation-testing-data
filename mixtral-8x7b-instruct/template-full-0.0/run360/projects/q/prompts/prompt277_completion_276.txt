 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the resolver will always resolve the promise with the value of the first argument, even if there are more than 2 arguments provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the resolver will always reject the promise, regardless of the number of arguments provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
arguments[0] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the resolver will only resolve the promise if the first argument is `undefined`, regardless of the number of arguments provided.

DONE.
