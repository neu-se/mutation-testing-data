  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `EOL` constant, which is a newline character, while the new code fragment uses a space character. This would cause the `stringify` function to produce different output, which could potentially cause issues in the code that uses this function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `EOL` constant, which is a newline character, while the new code fragment uses an empty string. This would cause the `stringify` function to produce different output, which could potentially cause issues in the code that uses this function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `EOL` constant, which is a newline character, while the new code fragment uses the `null` value. This would cause the `stringify` function to produce different output, which could potentially cause issues in
