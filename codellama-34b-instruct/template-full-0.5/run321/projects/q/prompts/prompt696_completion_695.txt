  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would only return the first two elements of the `arguments` object, rather than all elements starting from the second one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would only return the first element of the `arguments` object, rather than all elements starting from the second one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would only return elements starting from the third element of the `arguments` object, rather than all elements starting from the second one.

DONE.
