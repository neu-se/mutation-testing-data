 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule[1]` refers to the second element of the rule array, which is the result function, instead of the first element that is the matching pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.match(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule.match(word)` would attempt to call the `match` method on the rule object, which is not a regular expression, instead of using the `test` method on the regular expression pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].exec(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule[0].exec(word)` would attempt to call the `exec` method on the regular expression pattern, which would return an array of matches instead of a boolean value indicating whether the pattern matches the word.

DONE.
