  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is a variable representing the imaginary part of a complex number, while `b + 1` would be a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is a variable representing the imaginary part of a complex number, while `2 * b` would be a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is a variable representing the imaginary part of a complex number, while `b * b` would be a different value.

DONE.
