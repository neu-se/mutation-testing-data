  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val == null
```
This would result in different behavior because `val == null` would also match `null` and `undefined`, while `val === undefined` only matches `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!val
```
This would result in different behavior because `!val` would match any falsy value, including `undefined`, while `val === undefined` only matches `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof val === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof val === 'undefined'` would match any variable that is not defined, while `val === undefined` only matches a variable that is defined but has the value `undefined`.

DONE.
