 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
part.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it splits the part into an array of characters instead of treating it as a single string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
part.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the part to uppercase, which might not match the expected behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
globalThis[part]
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to access the part as a property of the global object, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
