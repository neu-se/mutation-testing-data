  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var next = Q.defer();
ends.resolve({
    head: value,
    tail: next.promise
});
ends.resolve = next.resolve;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Q.defer()` to create a new promise, but the replacement code fragment uses `Q.resolve()` to resolve the promise immediately. This could cause the promise to be resolved before it is expected to be resolved, leading to unexpected behavior in the code that uses the promise.

DONE.
