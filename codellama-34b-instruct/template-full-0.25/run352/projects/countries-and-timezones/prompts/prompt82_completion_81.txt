(c) => getCountry(c, { deprecated: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the country with the given ID, but with the `deprecated` property set to `true`, which would cause the `deliverCountry` function to return a different value.

```
(c) => getCountry(c, { timezones: [] })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the country with the given ID, but with the `timezones` property set to an empty array, which would cause the `
