  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a promise to be passed as an argument, but `null` is not a promise and would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a promise to be passed as an argument, but `undefined` is not a promise and would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(promises)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a promise to be passed as an argument, but `Q.resolve(promises)` is a promise that resolves to an array of promises, which is not the same as the original code.

DONE.
