  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `φ2` variable is not defined in the current scope, and the `φ1` variable is defined in the `calculateBearing` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function is called with the `φ1` variable as an argument, which is a different value than the `φ2` variable used in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function is called with the `φ1` variable as an argument, which is a different value than the `φ2` variable used in the original code.

DONE.
