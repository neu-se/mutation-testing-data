 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would receive a different argument, potentially causing it to return a different object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function does not handle `null` as a valid argument, and would likely throw an error or return an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Complex(1, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function expects a single argument, and passing an object would cause it to throw an error or return an incorrect result.

DONE.
