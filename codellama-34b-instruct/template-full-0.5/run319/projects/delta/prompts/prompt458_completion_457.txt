  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset = 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code sets `this.offset` to 0, but the mutated code sets it to 1. This change would cause the `peekLength()` method to return a different value, potentially causing the `hasNext()` method to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index = this.ops.length;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code sets `this.index` to 0, but the mutated code sets it to the length of the `ops` array. This change would cause the `peek()` method to return a different value, potentially causing the `next()` method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset = -1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code sets `this.offset` to 0, but the mutated code sets it to -1
