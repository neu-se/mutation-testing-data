  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the second argument of the `fcall` method to the `apply` method, whereas the original code fragment would pass an empty array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass all arguments of the `fcall` method to the `apply` method, whereas the original code fragment would pass only the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the third and subsequent arguments of the `fcall` method to the `apply` method, whereas the original code fragment would pass only the second argument.

DONE.
