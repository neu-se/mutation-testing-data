  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick(flush);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `flush` function to be called immediately, without waiting for the next tick.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick(function() {});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `flush` function to be called with a different argument, which could affect its behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick(function() {
    throw new Error("Testing mutation");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `flush` function to be called with a different argument, which could affect its behavior.

DONE.
