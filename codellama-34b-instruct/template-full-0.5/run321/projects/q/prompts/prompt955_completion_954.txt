  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(bound).fapply(nodeArgs)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fapply` method is not defined on the `Q` function, and would therefore throw a `TypeError` at runtime.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(bound).fcall(nodeArgs)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fcall` method is not defined on the `Q` function, and would therefore throw a `TypeError` at runtime.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(bound).apply(nodeArgs)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is not defined on the `Q` function, and would therefore throw a `TypeError` at runtime.

DONE.
