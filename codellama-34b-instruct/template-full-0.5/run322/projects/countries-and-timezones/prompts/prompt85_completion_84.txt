  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = true;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deliverTimezones` function to return all timezones, including deprecated ones, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = false;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deliverTimezones` function to only return non-deprecated timezones, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = !options.deprecated;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deliverTimezones` function to return all timezones, regardless of whether they are deprecated or not, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
