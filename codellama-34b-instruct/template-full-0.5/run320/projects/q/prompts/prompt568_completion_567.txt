  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
errback
```
This would result in different behavior because `errback` is a different function than `callback`, and it may have different side effects or behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a different function than `callback`, and it may have different side effects or behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a different function than `callback`, and it may have different side effects or behavior.

DONE.
