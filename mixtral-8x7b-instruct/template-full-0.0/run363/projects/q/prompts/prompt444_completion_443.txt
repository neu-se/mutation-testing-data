 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process.emit` function call in the `trackRejection` function would receive one less argument than it expects, causing an error in environments that support the `process` object with the `emit` method (like Node.js).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process.emit` function call in the `trackRejection` function would receive an empty object as the second argument instead of the rejected promise, which could cause unexpected behavior in the error handling code that relies on the rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process.emit` function call in the `trackRejection` function would receive a function reference as the second argument instead of the rejected promise, which could cause unexpected behavior in the error handling code that relies on the rejected promise.
