  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const handler = Delta.getHandler(embedType);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Delta.getHandler` is a method that returns a handler for the given `embedType`, which is not defined in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const handler = other.getHandler(embedType);
```
This would result in different behavior because `other` is not defined in the original code fragment, and `getHandler` is not a method that is typically defined on a `Delta` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const handler = Delta.getHandler(embedType, other);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Delta.getHandler` is a method that takes two arguments, `embedType` and `other`, and returns a handler for the given `embedType` and `other` object.

DONE.
