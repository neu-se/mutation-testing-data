  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a reference to a function, while this replacement is a function call, which would result in a different value being passed to the `nodeArgs` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver.bind(deferred)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a reference to a function, while this replacement is a bound function, which would result in a different value being passed to the `nodeArgs` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver.call(deferred)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a reference to a function, while this replacement is a function call, which would result in a different value being passed to the `nodeArgs` array.

DONE.
