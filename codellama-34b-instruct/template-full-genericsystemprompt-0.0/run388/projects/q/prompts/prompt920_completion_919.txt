  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Q can't wrap an undefined function"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would not throw an error if the callback is undefined, but this modified code fragment would throw an error in that case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(callback);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would call the callback with the given arguments, but this modified code fragment would resolve the promise with the callback function itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(callback);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would not notify the deferred object with the callback function, but this modified code fragment would notify the deferred object with the callback function.

DONE.
