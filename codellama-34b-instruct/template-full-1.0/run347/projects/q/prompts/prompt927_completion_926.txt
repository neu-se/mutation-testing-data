  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.npost
```
This would result in different behavior because `npost` is a different function than `array_slice`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(args).first
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.fapply(args).first` is a different expression than `array_slice`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.post
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.post` is a different function than `array_slice`.

DONE.
