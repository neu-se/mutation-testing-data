  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c < d
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the absolute value of `c` being less than the absolute value of `d`, while this new code fragment checks for `c` being less than `d` without considering their absolute values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c > d
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the absolute value of `c` being less than the absolute value of `d`, while this new code fragment checks for `c` being greater than `d` without considering their absolute values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === d
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the absolute value of `c` being less than the absolute value of `d`, while this new code fragment checks for `c` being equal to `d` without considering their absolute values.

DONE.
