  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.chop(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `chop` method is called with a non-null argument, which would cause the method to return a new Delta object with the first `length` elements removed, instead of the original Delta object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.chop(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `chop` method is called with a non-null argument, which would cause the method to return a new Delta object with the first `length` elements removed, instead of the original Delta object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.chop(2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `chop` method is called with a non-null argument, which would cause the method to return a new Delta object with the first `length` elements removed, instead of the original Delta object.

DONE.
