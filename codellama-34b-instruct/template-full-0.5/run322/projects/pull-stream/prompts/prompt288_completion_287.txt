  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `end` is truthy before calling `mapper(data)`, while this modified code fragment always calls `mapper(data)`, even if `end` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the original `data` value to `mapper(data)`, while this modified code fragment passes `data + 1` to `mapper(data)`, which could result in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end, data
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `end` is falsy before calling `mapper(data)`, while this modified code fragment always calls `mapper(data)`, regardless of the value of `end`.

DONE.
