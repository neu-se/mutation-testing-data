  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"put"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `put` method is not defined in the `Promise` prototype, so the code would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"getAll"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getAll` method is not defined in the `Promise` prototype, so the code would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"deleteAll"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deleteAll` method is not defined in the `Promise` prototype, so the code would throw an error.

DONE.
