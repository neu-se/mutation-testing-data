  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `onRejected` is a function that is called when the promise is rejected, whereas `onProgress` is a function that is called when the promise is in progress. Using `onRejected` instead of `onProgress` would cause the promise to be rejected immediately, rather than being in progress.
