  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls `cb` if `ended` is true, but this new code fragment calls `cb` regardless of the value of `ended`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the original `data` value to `cb`, but this new code fragment passes a modified `data` value to `cb`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the original `data` value to `cb`, but this new code fragment passes the first element of the `data` array to `cb`.

DONE.
