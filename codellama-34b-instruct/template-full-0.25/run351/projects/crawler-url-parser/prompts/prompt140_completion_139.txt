  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/default\.[a-z]+$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regex would cause the replace method to replace all occurrences of the pattern in the string, rather than just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/default\.[a-z]+$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regex would cause the replace method to ignore the case of the characters in the pattern, so it would match "Default.html" as well as "default.html".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/default\.[a-z]+$/m
```
This would result in different behavior because the `m` flag at the end of the regex would cause the replace method to match the pattern at the beginning of each line in the string, rather than just at the beginning of the string.

DONE.
