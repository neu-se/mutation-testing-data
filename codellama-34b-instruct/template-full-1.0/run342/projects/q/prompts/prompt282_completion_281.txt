  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would capture the additional arguments passed to the function, but it would not include the first two arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would capture the additional arguments passed to the function, but it would not include the first three arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, <PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would capture the additional arguments passed to the function, but it would not include the first <PLACEHOLDER> arguments.

DONE.
