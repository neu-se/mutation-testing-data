  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject, deferred.resolve, deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` function would be called instead of `deferred.reject`, which would cause the promise to be resolved instead of rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve, deferred.reject, deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` function would be called instead of `deferred.resolve`, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve, deferred.reject, deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify` function would be called instead of `deferred.resolve` or `deferred.reject`, which would cause the promise to be notified instead of resolved or rejected.

DONE.
