  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that returns a new array with a subset of elements from the original array, while `array_slice.bind(null)` returns a new function that, when called, will return a new array with a subset of elements from the original array, but with a `this` value of `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.bind(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that returns a new array with a subset of elements from the original array, while `array_slice.bind(undefined)` returns a new function that, when called, will return a new array with a subset of elements from the original array, but with a `this` value of `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.bind(void 0)
```
This would result in different behavior
