  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.calculateBearing(this.calculateDestination(distance, bearing))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the bearing from the destination point instead of from the original point, which could lead to incorrect results for certain test cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.calculateBearing(this.calculateDestination(distance * 2, bearing))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the bearing from a point that is twice as far away from the original point as the destination point, which could lead to incorrect results for certain test cases.
