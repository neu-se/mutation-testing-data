  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of the `op` object is not guaranteed to be the same as the `opLength` variable, which is calculated based on the length of the `op` object's `insert` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of the `op` object is not guaranteed to be the same as the `opLength` variable, which is calculated based on the length of the `op` object's `insert` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op.insert` property is not guaranteed to be a string, and the `length` property of a non-string object is not defined.

DONE.
