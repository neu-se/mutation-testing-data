  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(index - 1) < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the loop to continue when the current index is 0, whereas the original line would have caused the loop to exit if the index was 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(index + 1) < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the loop to continue when the current index is -1, whereas the original line would have caused the loop to exit if the index was -1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue even if the index is 0, whereas the original line would have caused the loop to exit if the index was 0.

DONE.
