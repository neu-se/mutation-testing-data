  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort` is never called with the original code fragment, but it would be called with the modified code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes `abort` as the first argument to `abortCb`, but the modified code fragment passes `cb` instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(null, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes `abort` and `onAbort` as the arguments to `abortCb`, but the modified code fragment passes `null` and `onAbort` instead.

DONE.
