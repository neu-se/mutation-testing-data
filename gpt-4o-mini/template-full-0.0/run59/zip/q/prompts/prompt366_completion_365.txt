Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the exception instead of resolving it, leading to a different outcome in the promise chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with a `null` value instead of the original rejected value, potentially leading to unexpected results in subsequent `.then()` calls.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve("Unexpected Value");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with a hardcoded string "Unexpected Value" instead of the actual value from the `_rejected` function, which could mislead the promise consumers.

DONE.
