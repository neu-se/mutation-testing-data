  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method is being called with different arguments, which would result in a different subset of the `arguments` array being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method is being called with different arguments, which would result in a different subset of the `arguments` array being returned.

DONE.
