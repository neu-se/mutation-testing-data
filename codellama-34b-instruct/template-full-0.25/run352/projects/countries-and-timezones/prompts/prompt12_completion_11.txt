  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] = { current: [], all: [] };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always overwrite the existing `result[country]` object, even if it already existed. In the original code, the `Object.assign()` method is used to merge the new `country` object with the existing `result[country]` object, if it exists.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] = { current: [id], all: [id] };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the `current` and `all` properties of the `result[country]` object to the same value, regardless of whether they already existed or not. In the original code, the `current` and `all` properties are only set if they do not already exist.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] = { current: [id], all: [id] };
```
This would result in different behavior because
