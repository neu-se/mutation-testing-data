  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb2
```
This would result in different behavior because a new variable `verb2` is created, which may not be intended. The original code fragment `const verb` is already declaring a variable `verb`, replacing it with `const verb2` would cause the code to produce different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let verb = "verb"
```
This would result in different behavior because `let` is a mutating operation that creates a new binding in the current scope, whereas `const` creates a constant binding in the current scope. The original code fragment `const verb` is creating a constant binding, replacing it with `let verb = "verb"` would cause the code to produce different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = "verb2"
```
This would result in different behavior because a new constant binding `verb` with the value `"verb2"` is created, which may not be intended. The original code fragment `const verb` is
