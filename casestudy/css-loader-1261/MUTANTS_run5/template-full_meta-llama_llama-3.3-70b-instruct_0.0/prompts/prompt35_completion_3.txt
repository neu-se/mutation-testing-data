Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
encodeURI(normalizedUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because `encodeURI` is used instead of `unescape`, which would change the way the URL is processed, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
normalizedUrl.replace(/%/g, '%25')
```
This would result in different behavior because it manually attempts to escape the URL by replacing '%' characters, but does not properly handle other special characters, which could lead to incorrect URL decoding.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
url
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the original `url` variable instead of the `normalizedUrl` variable, which may not have undergone the necessary processing steps, potentially leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
