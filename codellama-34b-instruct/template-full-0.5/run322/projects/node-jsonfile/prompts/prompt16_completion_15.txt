  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_readFile.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method creates a new function with the `this` context set to `null`, which would cause the `_readFile` function to be called with the wrong context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_readFile.bind(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method creates a new function with the `this` context set to `undefined`, which would cause the `_readFile` function to be called with the wrong context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_readFile.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method creates a new function with the `this` context set to the current context, which would cause the `_readFile` function to be called with the wrong context.

DONE.
