  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'https://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only replaces the protocol with "http://" if it is not already present in the URL, while this modified code fragment would always replace it with "https://", potentially changing the meaning of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'ftp://')

This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only replaces the protocol with "http://" if it is not already present in the URL, while this modified code fragment would always replace it with "ftp://", potentially changing the meaning of the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'javascript:')
```
This would result in different behavior because
