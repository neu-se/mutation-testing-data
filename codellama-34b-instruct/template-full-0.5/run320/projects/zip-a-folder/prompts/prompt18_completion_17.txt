  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.R_OK & fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the bitwise AND operator would always return 0, even if the file has read and write permissions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.R_OK ^ fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the bitwise XOR operator would always return a non-zero value, even if the file has read and write permissions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.R_OK + fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition operator would always return a non-zero value, even if the file has read and write permissions.

DONE.
