  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because the "get" method is not the same as the "post" method, and it would produce a different result in the context of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name, []
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` variable is not passed as an argument, which would cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, nodeArgs
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value is not a valid value for the first argument of the `dispatch` method, which would cause the function to throw an error instead of returning a promise.

DONE.
