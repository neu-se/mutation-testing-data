Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the number of arguments passed to the `array_slice` function, which may lead to incorrect binding of the function context and unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3
```
This would result in different behavior because it alters the number of arguments passed to the `array_slice` function, potentially causing the function to behave incorrectly by including too many or too few arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it dynamically uses the number of arguments passed to the function instead of a fixed number, which could lead to unexpected results if the number of arguments varies.

DONE.
