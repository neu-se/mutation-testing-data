  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is not defined for the `Complex` class, and the code would throw a `TypeError` if it were executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is not defined for the `Complex` class, and the code would throw a `TypeError` if it were executed.

DONE.
