  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
untrackRejection(this);
```
This would result in different behavior because `untrackRejection` is not a function, so it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackRejection(this);
```
This would result in different behavior because `trackRejection` is not a function, so it would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is not a function, so it would throw an error.

DONE.
