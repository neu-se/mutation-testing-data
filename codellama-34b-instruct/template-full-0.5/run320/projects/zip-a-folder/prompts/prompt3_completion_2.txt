  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{src, targetFilePath: tarFilePath, format: 'tar', compression: COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed}
```
This would result in different behavior because the compression level would be changed from the default high compression to uncompressed, which would result in a larger file size and potentially slower compression and decompression times.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{src, targetFilePath: tarFilePath, format: 'tar', zipAFolderOptions: {compression: COMPRESSION_LEVEL.medium}}
```
This would result in different behavior because the compression level would be changed from the default high compression to medium compression, which would result in a smaller file size and potentially faster compression and decompression times.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{src, targetFilePath: tarFilePath, format: 'tar', zipAFolderOptions: {compression: COMPRESSION_LEVEL.high, customWriteStream
