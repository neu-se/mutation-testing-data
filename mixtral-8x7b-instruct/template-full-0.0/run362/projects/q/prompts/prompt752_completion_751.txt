 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Error("This is a buggy error")
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new error object with a different message, which might not be handled correctly by the error handling code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the type of the value being rejected from an Error object to a null value, which might not be handled correctly by the error handling code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
rejection.message = rejection.message + " (modified)"
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the message property of the Error object being rejected, which might cause unexpected behavior in the error handling code.

DONE.
