  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would turn the `nodeArgs` variable into a function, which would not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a runtime error, as `null` cannot have properties accessed on it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would bind the `array_slice` function to the `null` context, which would result in the function being called with a different `this` binding than was intended.

DONE.
