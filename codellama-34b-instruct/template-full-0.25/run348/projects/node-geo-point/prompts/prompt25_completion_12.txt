  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'longitudee'
```
This would result in different behavior because the extra "e" at the end of the string would cause the code to throw a `TypeError` when trying to access the `longitude` property of the `object` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'longitude' + 'e'
```
This would result in different behavior because the concatenation of the string "longitude" with the string "e" would cause the code to throw a `TypeError` when trying to access the `longitude` property of the `object` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'longitude' - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 1 from the string "longitude" would cause the code to throw a `TypeError` when trying to access the `longitude` property of the `object` variable.

DONE.
