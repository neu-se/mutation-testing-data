  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would return a promise that is resolved with `null`, rather than the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would return a promise that is resolved with `undefined`, rather than the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would return a promise that is rejected with an error, rather than the original value.

DONE.
