  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, even if the promise has been resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, even if the promise has not been resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the opposite of the original value of `resolvedPromise`, which could be `true` or `false`.

DONE.
