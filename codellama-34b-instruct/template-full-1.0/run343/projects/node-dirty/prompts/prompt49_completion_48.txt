  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the updater function would no longer be called, and the update would always be set to null, regardless of the current value of the key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the updater function would no longer be called, and the key would be removed from the cache, resulting in different cache behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the updater function would no longer be called, and the key would be set to NaN, which is different from the original value.

DONE.
