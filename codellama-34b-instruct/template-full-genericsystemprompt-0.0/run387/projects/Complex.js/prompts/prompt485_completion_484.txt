  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `exports` is an object, while the modified code fragment checks if `exports` is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `exports` is an object, while the modified code fragment checks if `exports` is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `exports` is an object, while the modified code fragment checks if `exports` is a number.

DONE.
