  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages[messages.length - 1]
```
This would result in the last message being pushed instead of the first one, which would change the behavior of the program since the last message pushed is used as the reference value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.shift()
```
This would result in the first message being removed instead of pushed, which would change the behavior of the program since the messages are used to determine the promise's state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.slice(1)
```
This would result in all but the first message being pushed, which would change the behavior of the program since the messages are used to determine the promise's state.

DONE.
