  Sure, I'll apply various mutations to the code and provide you with three options for each mutation, as follows:

Mutation 1: Replace "basename" with "filename" in the PLACEHOLDER.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with "filename". This would result in different behavior because the "filename" property may not always be present in the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with "". This would result in different behavior because an empty string will be returned, rather than the expected filename.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with a random string. This would result in different behavior because a random string will be returned, rather than the expected filename.

Mutation 2: Replace "basename" with "extension" in the PLACEHOLDER.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with "extension". This would result in different behavior because the "extension" property may not always be present in the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced
