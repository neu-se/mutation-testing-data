  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pathname.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `pathname` is a string, while `pathname.split('/').pop()` is an array of strings. This change would cause the `decodeURIComponent` function to throw an error, as it expects a string as input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pathname.split('/').shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `pathname` is a string, while `pathname.split('/').shift()` is a string that represents the first element of the array returned by `pathname.split('/')`. This change would cause the `decodeURIComponent` function to receive a different input, which could result in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pathname.split('/').slice(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `pathname` is a string, while `path
