  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring()` method returns a new string starting from the specified index, whereas the original code fragment simply references the entire `content` string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method returns a new string with all characters in lowercase, whereas the original code fragment simply references the original `content` string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method returns an array of substrings, whereas the original code fragment simply references the original `content` string.

DONE.
