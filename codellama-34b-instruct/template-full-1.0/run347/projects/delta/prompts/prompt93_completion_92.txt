  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of the array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(0, 0, newOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` adds an element at a specific index in the array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(0, 0).concat(newOp).concat(this.ops.slice(0, 0))
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` creates a new array by copying a portion of the original array, whereas `push` mutates the original array.

DONE.
