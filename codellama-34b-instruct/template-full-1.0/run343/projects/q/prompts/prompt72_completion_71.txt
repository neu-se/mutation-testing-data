  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, so the `requestTick` function would not be called, resulting in no further execution of the `flush` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, so the `requestTick` function would not be called, resulting in no further execution of the `flush` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"flush"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"flush"` is a string and not a function, so the `requestTick` function would not be called, resulting in no further execution of the `flush` function.

DONE.
