  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
k = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable `k` would always be initialized to zero, regardless of its original value, which could cause the loop to never terminate or produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
k = Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable `k` would be initialized to a random value each time the loop is executed, which could cause the loop to produce different results each time.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
k = 'Hello, World!'
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable `k` would be initialized to a string value, which could cause the loop to produce different results, depending on the specific string value.

DONE.
