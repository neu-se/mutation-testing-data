 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `z['re']`
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the real part of the current complex number as the second operand, even when the input is not infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `1`
This would result in different behavior because it would always add 1 to the first operand, even when the input is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `Math.random()`
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce randomness in the comparison, making the test suite unpredictable and potentially allowing some issues to go unnoticed.

DONE.
