  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finalize` method is called twice, which could cause the archive to be finalized twice, potentially leading to errors or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finalize` method is called with a `null` argument, which could cause the archive to be finalized with an invalid argument, potentially leading to errors or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finalize` method is called with an `undefined` argument, which could cause the archive to be finalized with an invalid argument, potentially leading to errors or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
