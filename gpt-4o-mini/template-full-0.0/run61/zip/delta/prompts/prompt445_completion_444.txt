Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to access the next operation in the array instead of the current one, which could lead to incorrect calculations of lengths and offsets.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index] || null
```
This would result in different behavior because it will return `null` if there is no operation at the current index, which could cause the `Op.length` function to behave unexpectedly if it does not handle `null` inputs properly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index] && this.ops[this.index].insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it will return the `insert` property of the current operation if it exists, or `undefined` if it does not, potentially leading to incorrect length calculations when the `insert` property is not present.

DONE.
