  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodedBasename.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `basename` is not case-sensitive, while `decodedBasename.toLowerCase()` is case-sensitive. This could cause the test to pass even if the code is not working correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodeURIComponent(pathname)
```
This would result in different behavior because `decodeURIComponent(pathname)` is not the same as `decodeURIComponent(basename)`. This could cause the test to pass even if the code is not working correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basename.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `basename` is not case-sensitive, while `basename.toUpperCase()` is case-sensitive. This could cause the test to pass even if the code is not working correctly.

DONE.
