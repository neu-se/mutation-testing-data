  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!id
```
This would result in different behavior because `!` is a logical NOT operator,
which would negate the value of `id`. In the original code, `id` is used as an
index to access an object property. If `id` is replaced with `!id`, the
evaluated value would be the opposite of the original `id` value, which
would result in a different property being accessed or an error if the
opposite value is not a valid property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the value of
`id`. In the original code, `id` is used as an index to access an object
property. If `id` is replaced with `id * 2`, the evaluated value would be
twice the original `id` value, which would result in a different property
being accessed or an error if the doubled value is not a valid property.

Option 3: The
