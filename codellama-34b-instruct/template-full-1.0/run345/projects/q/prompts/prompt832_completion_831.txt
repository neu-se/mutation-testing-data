  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return callback.fcall().then(function () {
    throw reason;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a promise that is rejected with the reason, while this new code fragment returns a promise that is fulfilled with no value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return callback.fcall().then(function () {
    throw reason;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a promise that is rejected with the reason, while this new code fragment returns a promise that is fulfilled with the reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return callback.fcall().then(function () {
    throw new Error(reason);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a promise that is rejected with the reason, while this new code fragment returns a promise that is rejected with a new error object that has the reason as its message.

DONE.
