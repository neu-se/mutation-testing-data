  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method would be called with `null` as the `this` value, which would likely cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method would be called with `undefined` as the `this` value, which would likely cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method would be called with `0` as the `this` value, which would likely cause an error.

DONE.
