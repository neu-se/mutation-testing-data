  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `url` property of the `options` object as the first argument to the `request` function, instead of passing the `options` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `dest` property of the `options` object as the first argument to the `request` function, instead of passing the `options` object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url + options.dest
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `url` and `dest` properties of the `options` object and pass the resulting string as the first argument to the `request` function, instead of passing the `options` object itself.

DONE.
