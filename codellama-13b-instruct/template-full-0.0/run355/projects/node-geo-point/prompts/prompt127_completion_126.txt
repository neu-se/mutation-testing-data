  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDistance` method would return the distance between the two points in meters, whereas the original code fragment would return the distance between the two points in degrees.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDistance` method would return the distance between the two points in meters, whereas the original code fragment would return the distance between the two points in degrees.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDistance` method would return the distance between the two points in meters, whereas the original code fragment would return the distance between the two points in radians.

DONE.
