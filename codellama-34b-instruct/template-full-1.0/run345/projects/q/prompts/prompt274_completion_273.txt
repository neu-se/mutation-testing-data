  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (error instanceof Error)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `instanceof` operator checks if `error` is an instance of the `Error` class, while the `===` operator checks for strict equality. If `error` is not an instance of `Error`, the two conditions would not be equivalent.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (error.name === "Error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `name` property of an `Error` object contains the error name, while the `=== `operator checks for strict equality. If the error name is not "Error", the two conditions would not be equivalent.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (error.message === "Invalid argument")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `message` property of an `Error` object contains the error message, while the `===` operator checks for strict equality. If the error message is not "Invalid argument", the two conditions
