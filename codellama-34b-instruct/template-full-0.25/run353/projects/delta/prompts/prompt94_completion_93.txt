  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a valid `Op` object, but `null` would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a valid `Op` object with a specific structure, but `{}` would not have the same properties and methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ insert: 'foo' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a valid `Op` object with a specific structure, but `{ insert: 'foo' }` would have a different `insert` property value.

DONE.
