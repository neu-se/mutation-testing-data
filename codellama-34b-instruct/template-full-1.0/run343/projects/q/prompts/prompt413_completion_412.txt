  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFunction
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPromiseAlike` function would always return `false`, as `isFunction` checks if a value is a function, and `isPromise` checks if a value is a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPromiseAlike` function would always return `true`, as `isPromise` checks if a value is a promise, and `isPromiseAlike` checks if a value is either a promise or a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof object === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof object` checks the type of `object`, and `isPromise` checks if a value is a promise.

DONE.
