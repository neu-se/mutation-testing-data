  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the queue is empty before proceeding, while this replacement checks if the queue is not empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the queue is empty before proceeding, while this replacement checks if there are any in-flight writes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._waitForDrain
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the queue is empty before proceeding, while this replacement checks if the write stream is waiting for a drain event.

DONE.
