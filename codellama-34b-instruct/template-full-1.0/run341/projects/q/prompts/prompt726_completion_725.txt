  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
snapshot.value
```
This would result in different behavior because `snapshot` is not defined in the current scope. 

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromise()
```
This would result in different behavior because 'isPromise() is a function that checks if a value is a promise or not. It would always return false since 'snapshot.value' is not a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```isEmpty().```
 This would result in different behavior because it would check if the value is an empty string. If its not, the result would be the original value instead of throwing an error.

DONE.
