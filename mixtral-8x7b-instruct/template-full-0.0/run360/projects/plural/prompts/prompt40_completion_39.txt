 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/appendix|index/i, function(w) { return w + 'ices' }
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of replacing the last two characters of the matched words with 'ices', it simply appends 'ices' to the end of the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/appendix|index/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ice' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it only replaces the last character of the matched words with 'ice', instead of replacing the last two characters with 'ices'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/appendix|index|bus|sis/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ices' }
