  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `arguments` object, which is an array-like object containing the values of the arguments passed to the function. Replacing it with `null` would cause the function to throw an error when trying to access the `length` property of `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `arguments` object, which is an array-like object containing the values of the arguments passed to the function. Replacing it with `undefined` would cause the function to throw an error when trying to access the `length` property of `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `arguments` object, which is an array-like object containing the values of the arguments passed to the function. Replacing it with an empty array would cause
