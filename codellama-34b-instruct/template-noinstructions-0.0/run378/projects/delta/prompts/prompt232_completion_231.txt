  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` function to return a different value, potentially leading to incorrect results in the `diff` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` function to return a different value, potentially leading to incorrect results in the `diff` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` function to return a different value, potentially leading to incorrect results in the `diff` function.

DONE.
