  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp._length = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would set the length attribute of an existing literal to 0, effectively changing the type of the literal to a Operator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp[typeof thisOp.retain] = thisOp
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would create a key in the "otherOp" object, where the key is the type of "thisOp", and the value is the "thisOp" operator itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.push(thisOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would push the "thisOp" operator onto the "otherOp" array, effectively appending the two arrays.

DONE.
