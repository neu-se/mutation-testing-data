  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.message
```
This would result in different behavior because `exception.message` is a string, whereas `exception` is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.name
```
This would result in different behavior because `exception.name` is a string, whereas `exception` is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because `exception.stack` is a string, whereas `exception` is an object.

DONE.
