  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` for objects, regardless of whether they are null or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.retain !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` for objects, regardless of whether they are null or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'object' && nextOp.retain !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` for objects that are null.

DONE.
