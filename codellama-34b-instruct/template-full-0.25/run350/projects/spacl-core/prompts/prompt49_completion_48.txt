  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice method would start from the second character instead of the first, which could cause the regex to match different parts of the path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(1, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice method would exclude the last character of the part, which could cause the regex to match different parts of the path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(1).replace(/[a-zA-Z0-9_]/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the replace method would remove all alphanumeric and underscore characters from the part, which could cause the regex to match different parts of the path.

DONE.
