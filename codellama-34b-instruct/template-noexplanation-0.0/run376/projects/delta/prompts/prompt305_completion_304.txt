  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length() < 0
```
This change will cause the `eachLine` method to always return `false` when checking if the line has a non-zero length, which will prevent the `predicate` function from being called and the `line` variable from being updated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length() === 0
```
This change will cause the `eachLine` method to always return `true` when checking if the line has a non-zero length, which will cause the `predicate` function to be called for every line, regardless of its length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length() > 1
```
This change will cause the `eachLine` method to always return `true` when checking if the line has a non-zero length, which will cause the `predicate` function to be called for every line, regardless of its length.

DONE.
