  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.toString()
```
This change will cause the `type` function to return the string representation of the object, rather than the object itself. This will cause the `addRule` function to fail when it tries to use the returned value as a regular expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.prototype
```
This change will cause the `type` function to return the prototype of the object, rather than the object itself. This will cause the `addRule` function to fail when it tries to use the returned value as a regular expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.constructor
```
This change will cause the `type` function to return the constructor function of the object, rather than the object itself. This will cause the `addRule` function to fail when it tries to use the returned value as a regular expression.

DONE.
