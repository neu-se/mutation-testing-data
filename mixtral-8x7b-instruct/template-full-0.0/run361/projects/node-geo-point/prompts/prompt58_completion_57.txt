 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` is the correct way to access the sine function in JavaScript, while `sin` is a shorthand that only works when `Math` is already in scope.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because 0 is the identity element for multiplication, so the expression would always evaluate to 0, regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, or `c`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / Math.cos(point1Rad) * Math.cos(point2Rad) * Math.cos(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the order of operations, which could lead to different results depending on the values of `point1Rad`, `point2Rad`, and `a`.

DONE.
