  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Buffer.isBuffer(content) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Buffer.isBuffer` method returns a boolean indicating whether the argument is a buffer, and the `===` operator checks for strict equality. In this case, the `content` variable would be coerced to a boolean, which would always be `false` if it is a buffer, causing the `content.toString('utf8')` method to be called even if `content` is not a buffer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.constructor === Buffer
```
This would result in different behavior because the `constructor` property of an object is a reference to the function that created the object, and the `Buffer` function is used to create buffer objects. In this case, the `content.constructor` property would be compared to the `Buffer` function, which would always be `false` if `content` is not a buffer, causing the `content.toString('utf8')` method to be called even if `content` is not a buffer
