  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country == null
```
This would result in different behavior because `!country` checks if the variable `country` is falsy, while `country == null` checks if the variable `country` is null or undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `!country` checks if the variable `country` is falsy, while `country !== null` checks if the variable `country` is not null or undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof country === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because `!country` checks if the variable `country` is falsy, while `typeof country === 'undefined'` checks if the variable `country` is undefined.

DONE.
