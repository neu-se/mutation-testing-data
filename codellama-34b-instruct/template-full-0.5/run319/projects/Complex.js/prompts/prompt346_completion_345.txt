  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the calculation of the complex number's real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the calculation of the complex number's real part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the calculation of the complex number's real part.

DONE.
