  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp.delete === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastOp.delete` is not an object and `typeof lastOp.delete === 'number'` would evaluate to false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.insert && typeof lastOp.insert === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastOp.insert` is a string and `typeof lastOp.insert === 'number'` would evaluate to false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(lastOp) && lastOp.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastOp` is an object not an array and `lastOp.length` would throw an error.

DONE.
