  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function is expected to return `end`, but instead it returns `null`, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that uses this function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the function is expected to return `end`, but instead it returns `undefined`, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that uses this function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the function is expected to return `end`, but instead it returns `0`, which is not a valid value for the `end` parameter and could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that uses this function.

DONE.
