  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, but `[]` is an empty array literal that does not have this behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"PLACEHOLDER"
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, but a string literal such as `"PLACEHOLDER"` does not have this behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, but `null` is a primitive value that does not have this behavior.

DONE.
