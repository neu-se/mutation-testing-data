  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'person', 'peoples'
```
This change will cause the `plural` function to return the incorrect plural form for the word "person".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'person', 'peopl'
```
This change will cause the `plural` function to return a truncated plural form for the word "person".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'person', 'peoples'
```
This change will cause the `plural` function to return the incorrect plural form for the word "person".

DONE.
