  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

Q.resolve

This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` is a function that returns a promise that is resolved with a given value, whereas `Q.race` is a function that returns a promise that is resolved or rejected based on the first promise to settle among an array of promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that returns a promise that is rejected with a given reason, whereas `Q.race` is a function that returns a promise that is resolved or rejected based on the first promise to settle among an array of promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all` is a function that returns a promise that is resolved with an array of values if all of the promises in an array of promises are resolved, whereas `Q.race` is a function that returns a promise
