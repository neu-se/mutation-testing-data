  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"something"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `plural` function to operate on the string "something" instead of the original input argument, potentially returning a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `plural` function to operate on the null value instead of the original input argument, potentially returning a different result or throwing an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `plural` function to operate on the undefined value instead of the original input argument, potentially returning a different result or throwing an error.

DONE.
