  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject, resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments to `Q` is reversed, causing the promise to be resolved instead of rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because only one argument is passed to `Q`, causing the promise to be resolved with the value `undefined` instead of being rejected with an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Test error")
```
This would result in different behavior because an error is thrown instead of returning a promise, causing the promise to be rejected with the error instead of being resolved or rejected based on the result of the `Q` call.

DONE.
