  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument passed to the `dispatch` method would be different. In the original code, the second argument is `array_slice(arguments, 1)`, which means that the first argument of the `Q.fcall` function is excluded from the slice. By changing it to `array_slice(arguments, 2)`, the first argument would be included, which could potentially change the behavior of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument passed to the `dispatch` method would be different. In the original code, the second argument is `array_slice(arguments, 1)`, which means that all arguments except the first one are included in the slice. By changing it to `array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)`, only the first argument would be included, which
