  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.filter
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method returns a new array containing all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, whereas the `map` method returns a new array containing the results of calling the provided function on every element in the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.reduce
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce` method applies a function to each element in the array, using the return value of the function as the "accumulator" for the next iteration, and returns the final value of the accumulator. The `map` method, on the other hand, returns a new array containing the results of calling the provided function on every element in the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.find
```
This would result in different behavior because the `find` method returns the first element in the array that passes the test implemented by the provided function, whereas
