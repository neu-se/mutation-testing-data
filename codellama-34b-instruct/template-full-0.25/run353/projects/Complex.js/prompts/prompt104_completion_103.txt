  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parser_exit` function would be called with a non-zero exit code, indicating an error, whereas the original code fragment would call `parser_exit` with no arguments, indicating a successful exit.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit('error');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parser_exit` function would be called with a string argument, indicating an error message, whereas the original code fragment would call `parser_exit` with no arguments, indicating a successful exit.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('Parse error');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throw` statement would cause an error to be thrown, whereas the original code fragment would call `parser_exit` to exit the program.

DONE.
