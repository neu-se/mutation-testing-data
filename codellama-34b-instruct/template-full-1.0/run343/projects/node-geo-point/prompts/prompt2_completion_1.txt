  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
latitude !== 0 || latitude !== 90
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked if `latitude` was between -90 and 90, while this new code fragment does not check if `latitude` is between -90 and 90.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
latitude % 2 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked if `latitude` was between -90 and 90, while this new code fragment checks if `latitude` is even.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(latitude) > 90
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked if `latitude` was between -90 and 90, while this new code fragment checks if `latitude` is greater than 90 in magnitude.

DONE.
