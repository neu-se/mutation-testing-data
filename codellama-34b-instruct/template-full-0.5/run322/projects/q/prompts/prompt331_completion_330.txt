  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the truthiness of the `resolve` variable, potentially causing the promise to be rejected even if the operation was successful.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would short-circuit the evaluation of the expression and return `false` if `resolve` is truthy, potentially causing the promise to be rejected even if the operation was successful.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would short-circuit the evaluation of the expression and return `true` if `resolve` is falsy, potentially causing the promise to be fulfilled even if the operation was not successful.

DONE.
