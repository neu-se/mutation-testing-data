  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (r - a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of a is reversed, which would change the result of the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (r + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because b is being used instead of a, which would change the result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (r + a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra term is being added to the calculation, which would change the result.

DONE.
