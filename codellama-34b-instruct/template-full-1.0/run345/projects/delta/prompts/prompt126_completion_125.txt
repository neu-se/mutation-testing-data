  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < end
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would potentially iterate beyond the end of the `ops` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > end
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would potentially iterate before the beginning of the `ops` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= end
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would potentially iterate beyond the end of the `ops` array.

DONE.
