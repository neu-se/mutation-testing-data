  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task, domain, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of the constant `1` would cause the `runSingle` function to be called with an additional argument, which would cause the function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task, domain, "test"
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of the string `"test"` would cause the `runSingle` function to be called with an additional argument, which would cause the function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task, domain, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of the constant `null` would cause the `runSingle` function to be called with an additional argument, which would cause the function to throw an error.

DONE.
