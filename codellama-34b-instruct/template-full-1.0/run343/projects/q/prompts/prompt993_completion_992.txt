  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const deferred = Q.defer();
```
This would result in different behavior because deferred would be initialized with a value of undefined, leading to an error when it is used as an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var deferred = new defer();
```
This would result in different behavior because `new` is not a valid operator in this context, leading to a syntax error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const deferred = Promise.defer();
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is not a static method of the Promise class, leading to a TypeError.

DONE.
