  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.R_OK & fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because when using the bitwise AND operator, only the `R_OK` permission is checked, which means that the code would not check if the target file has write permission, leading to potential issues.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.F_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because when using the `F_OK` constant, the code would check if the target file path exists, but it would not check if the file is readable or writable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.R_OK | fs.constants.W_OK | fs.constants.X_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because when using the bitwise OR operator, the code would check if the target file has read, write, and execute permissions, which are not present in the original code fragment.
