  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `map` is a function, and `map.length` would return the length of the function's parameter list, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map.call(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `map` is a function, and `map.call(null, data)` would call the function with a `null` context and the `data` argument, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map[data]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `map` is a function, and `map[data]` would access a property on the function object with the name of the `data` argument, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
