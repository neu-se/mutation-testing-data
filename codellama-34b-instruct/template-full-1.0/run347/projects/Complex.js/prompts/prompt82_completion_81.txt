  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === 'j' || c === 'J'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be checking for the letter 'j' or 'J' instead of 'i' or 'I', which would cause the code to behave differently in cases where a 'j' or 'J' character is encountered.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === ('i' != 'j')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be checking if 'i' is not equal to 'j', instead of checking if 'c' is equal to 'i' or 'I', which would cause the code to behave differently in cases where a 'j' character is encountered.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c !== 'i' && c !== 'I'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be checking if 'c' is not equal to 'i' or 'I', instead of checking if 'c' is equal to 'i' or
