  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete(rest).chop
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the `rest` instead of concatenating it to the `delta`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.slice(rest).chop
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the `delta` starting from the `rest` instead of concatenating the `rest` to the `delta`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat(delta).chop
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `delta` to itself, causing a doubling of the `delta`.

DONE.
