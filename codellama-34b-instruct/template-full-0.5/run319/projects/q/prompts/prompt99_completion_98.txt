  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute, as the starting condition `index > length` is never true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index -= 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would decrement `index` by 1 on each iteration, potentially causing the loop to never terminate if `index` is not initially 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length -= 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would terminate early if `length` is not initially 0, as the loop condition `index < length` would no longer be true.

DONE.
