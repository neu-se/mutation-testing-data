  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` value passed as the third argument would cause the `search` and `query` properties to be excluded from the returned URL object, which could affect the logic of the `parse` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` value passed as the second argument would cause the `auth` property to be excluded from the returned URL object, which could affect the logic of the `parse` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `true` value passed as the third argument would cause the `search` and `query` properties to be included in the returned URL object, which could affect the logic of the `parse` function.
