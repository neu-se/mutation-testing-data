  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be inverted, causing the code to behave differently when the queue is empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be inverted, causing the code to behave differently when the queue is not empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be inverted, causing the code to behave differently when the queue is empty.

DONE.
