  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns the values of the object's own properties, while `Object.keys` returns the keys of the object's own properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries` returns an array containing the key-value pairs of the object's own properties, while `Object.keys` returns an array containing the keys of the object's own properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.getOwnProperties
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.getOwnPropertyNames` returns an array containing the key-value pairs of the object's own properties, while `Object.keys` returns an array containing the keys of the object's own properties.

DONE.
