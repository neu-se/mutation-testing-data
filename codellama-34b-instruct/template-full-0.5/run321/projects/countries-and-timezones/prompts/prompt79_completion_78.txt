  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(name.toLowerCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezone` function would be called with a lowercase version of the `name` parameter, which could potentially return a different timezone object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(name.split(' ').join('_'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezone` function would be called with a modified version of the `name` parameter, which could potentially return a different timezone object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(name.replace(' ', '_'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezone` function would be called with a modified version of the `name` parameter, which could potentially return a different timezone object.

DONE.
