  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls `pull` with the first four arguments, while this replacement calls it with all five arguments. This could potentially cause the function to behave differently if the fifth argument is not `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3], ref[4])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls `pull` with the first four arguments, while this replacement calls it with all six arguments. This could potentially cause the function to behave differently if the sixth argument is not `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
