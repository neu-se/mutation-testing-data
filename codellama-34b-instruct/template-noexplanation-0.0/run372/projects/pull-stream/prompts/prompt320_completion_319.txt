  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This change will cause the function to return `null` instead of the original `data` value, which may cause unexpected behavior in the calling code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This change will cause the function to return `undefined` instead of the original `data` value, which may cause unexpected behavior in the calling code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This change will cause the function to return the original `data` value plus 1, which may cause unexpected behavior in the calling code.

DONE.
