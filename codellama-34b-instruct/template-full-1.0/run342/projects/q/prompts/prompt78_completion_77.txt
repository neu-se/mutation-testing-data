  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { throw "Error!"; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error instead of calling the `flush` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { /* empty function */ }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would do nothing instead of calling the `flush` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { setTimeout(flush, 5000); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delay the call to `flush` by 5 seconds.

DONE.
