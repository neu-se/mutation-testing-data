  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function is expecting a radian angle as input, while `-1` is a scalar value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a+b)/2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function is expecting a radian angle as input, while `(a+b)/2` is a scalar value that represents the average of the `a` and `b` scalars.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a*b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function is expecting a radian angle as input, while `a*b` is a scalar value that represents the product of the `a` and `b` scalars.

DONE.
