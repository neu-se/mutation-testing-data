  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both objects and null values, while this new code fragment only checks for strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both objects and null values, while this new code fragment only checks for undefined values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both objects and null values, while this new code fragment only checks for numbers.

DONE.
