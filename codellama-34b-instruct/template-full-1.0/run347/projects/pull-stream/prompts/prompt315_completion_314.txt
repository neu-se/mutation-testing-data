  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, data
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`, and would cause the callback to pass a different value than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not the same as `data`, and would cause the callback to pass a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"", data
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty string is not the same as `null`, and would cause the callback to pass a different value than the original code.

DONE.
