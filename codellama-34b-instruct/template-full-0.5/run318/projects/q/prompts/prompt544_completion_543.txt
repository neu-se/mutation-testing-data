  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
StopIteration === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` is an operator that returns the type of a variable as a string, while `StopIteration === undefined` is a comparison that checks if the variable `StopIteration` is equal to the value `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof StopIteration !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the type of `StopIteration` is not equal to the string `"undefined"`, which is the opposite of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
StopIteration !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the variable `StopIteration` is not equal to the value `undefined`, which is the opposite of the original code.

DONE.
