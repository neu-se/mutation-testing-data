  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/(.*.)index\.[a-z]+$/, '/').replace
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex pattern is now greedy, matching any character before "index" instead of only matching a single character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '').replace
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex pattern now matches the entire string "index" instead of just the first character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/\/index\.[a-z]+/), '/').replace
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex pattern now matches the entire string "index" and the replacement string is now empty.

DONE.
