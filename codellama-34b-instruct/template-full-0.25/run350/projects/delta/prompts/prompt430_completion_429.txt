  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `this.peekLength(<PLACEHOLDER>)` would return the length of the current op, while `this.peekLength(0)` would return the length of the first op in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength(this.offset)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `this.peekLength(<PLACEHOLDER>)` would return the length of the current op, while `this.peekLength(this.offset)` would return the length of the current op minus the offset.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength(this.index)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `this.peekLength(<PLACEHOLDER>)` would return the length of the current op, while `this
