Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('body')
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the context of the jQuery selector from the entire document to only the `<body>` element, potentially missing links that are outside of the body tag.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('a:first')
```
This would result in different behavior because it restricts the selection to only the first anchor (`<a>`) element found in the document, which would prevent the extraction of all links and lead to incomplete results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('a').first()
```
This would result in different behavior because it selects the first anchor element and returns a jQuery object containing only that element, which would limit the processing to just one link instead of iterating over all anchor elements.

DONE.
