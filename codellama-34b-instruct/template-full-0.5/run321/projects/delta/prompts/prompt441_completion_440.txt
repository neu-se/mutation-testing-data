  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.insert.substr(offset, length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method takes a zero-based index, so the resulting substring would be one character shorter than the original.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.insert.substr(offset + 1, length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method takes a zero-based index, so the resulting substring would start one character after the original.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.insert.substr(offset, length + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method takes a zero-based index, so the resulting substring would be one character longer than the original.

DONE.
