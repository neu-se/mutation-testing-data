  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection"
```
This would result in different behavior because "unhandledRejection" is a different event that is not handled in the `untrackRejection` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled" + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would change the value of the `rejectionHandled` argument, potentially causing the program to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled".toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would change the value of the `rejectionHandled` argument, potentially causing the program to behave differently.

DONE.
