  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['r']
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be accessing the `r` property of the `a` object instead of the `phi` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['phi'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be adding 1 to the `phi` property of the `a` object instead of using it as is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['phi'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be multiplying the `phi` property of the `a` object by 2 instead of using it as is.

DONE.
