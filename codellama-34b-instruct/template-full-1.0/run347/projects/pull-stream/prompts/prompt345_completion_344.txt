  Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
abort === true ? onAbort(null) : null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `onAbort` callback with `null` instead of the original `abort` value.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
abort === true ? null : onAbort(abort);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not call the `onAbort` callback when `abort` is not equal to true.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
abort === true ? onAbort(abort) : null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `onAbort` callback with the `abort` value only if `abort` is equal to true.

DONE.
