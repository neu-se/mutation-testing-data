  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const embedType: string = 'embedType';
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the value `'embedType'` to the variable `embedType`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const embedType: number = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the value `0` to the variable `embedType`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const embedType: boolean = false;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the value `false` to the variable `embedType`, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
