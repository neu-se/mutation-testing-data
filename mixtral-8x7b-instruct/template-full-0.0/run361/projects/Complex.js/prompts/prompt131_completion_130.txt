 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to divide 1 by the result of the `isInfinite()` method, which would always return `false` or `undefined`, causing a division-by-zero error or `NaN`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, even when the original condition should be true. This would cause the function to incorrectly return `Complex['INFINITY']` in some cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if the real part of the complex number is equal to positive infinity, while the original condition checks if either part is infinite. This would cause the function to incorrectly return `Complex['INFINITY']` or `Complex['N
