  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because the `elem.delete` property is not defined in the original code, whereas `elem.insert` is defined. This would cause the code to throw an error when attempting to access the `delete` property of `elem`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.insert.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` property of `elem` is a string, and the `length` property of a string is the number of characters in the string. This would cause the code to return the length of the `insert` property instead of the `delete` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.attributes.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attributes` property of `elem` is an object, and the `length` property of an object is the number of properties in the object. This would cause the code to return the number of properties in the `attributes` object
