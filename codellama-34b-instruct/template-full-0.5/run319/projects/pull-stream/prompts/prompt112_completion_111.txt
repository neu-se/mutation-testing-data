  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc + data
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add `acc` and `data` instead of assigning `data` to `acc`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc * data
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply `acc` and `data` instead of assigning `data` to `acc`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc - data
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract `data` from `acc` instead of assigning `data` to `acc`.

DONE.
