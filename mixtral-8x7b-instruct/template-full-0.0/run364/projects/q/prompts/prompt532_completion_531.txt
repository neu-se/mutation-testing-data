 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].concat.bind(null, value).spread
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `concat` method of the Array prototype with a null `this` value and the `value` as the first argument, followed by the `spread` method. This changes the behavior of the `spread` function as it is now operating on an array created by `concat` instead of the original `value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q(value).then(spread)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `then` method of the Q promise instead of the `spread` method directly. This might cause different behavior since `then` expects a fulfillment handler and a rejection handler, while `spread` expects arguments to spread.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
value.spread
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to access the `spread`
