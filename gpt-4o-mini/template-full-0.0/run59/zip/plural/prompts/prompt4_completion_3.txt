Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the starting index for the substring extraction to 0, which would return the entire string instead of the substring excluding the last character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1, 8
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the parameters for the `slice` method, which would cause it to extract a substring starting from the last character and going to the 8th character, likely resulting in an unexpected output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
7, -2
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the starting index to 7, which would skip the first seven characters of the string, and the ending index to -2, which would exclude the last two characters, leading to incorrect pluralization results.

DONE.
