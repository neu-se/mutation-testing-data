Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses the latitude of the destination point instead of the latitude of the starting point, leading to an incorrect calculation of the bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the latitude of the starting point, which would skew the bearing calculation by artificially altering the starting latitude.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1 - 90
```
This would result in different behavior because it subtracts 90 degrees from the latitude of the starting point, which would result in an invalid latitude and cause the bearing calculation to produce nonsensical results.

DONE.
