  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args, void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the first argument to the `apply` method is `void 0`, which is the same as `undefined`. In this replacement, the first argument is `args`, which is the method's second argument, and the second argument is `void 0`, which is still `undefined`. This replacement would cause the `apply` method to be called with the arguments in the reverse order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the first argument to the `apply` method is `void 0`, which is the same as `undefined`. In this replacement, the first argument is `null`, which is a different value altogether. This replacement would cause the `apply` method to be called with a `null` value as the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because in
