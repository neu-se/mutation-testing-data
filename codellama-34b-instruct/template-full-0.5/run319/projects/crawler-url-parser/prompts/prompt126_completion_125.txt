  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseInt
```
This would result in different behavior because `parseInt` is a function that parses a string and returns an integer, whereas `parse` is a function that parses a URL and returns an object with its components.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseFloat
```
This would result in different behavior because `parseFloat` is a function that parses a string and returns a floating-point number, whereas `parse` is a function that parses a URL and returns an object with its components.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.parse` is a function that parses a JSON string and returns an object, whereas `parse` is a function that parses a URL and returns an object with its components.

DONE.
