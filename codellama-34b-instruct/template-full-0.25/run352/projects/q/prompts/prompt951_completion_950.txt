  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs
```
This would result in different behavior because `nodeArgs` is a different variable than `arguments`, and it may not contain the same values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseArgs` is a different variable than `arguments`, and it may not contain the same values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.slice(2)` is a different array than `arguments`, and it may not contain the same values.

DONE.
