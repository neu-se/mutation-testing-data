Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
utils.pattern.convertPatternsToRe.bind(null, negative, this._micromatchOptions)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method is used to set the context of the function, but in this case, it's not necessary and might cause issues if the function is not designed to be bound.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
utils.pattern.convertPatternsToRe(negative, {...this._micromatchOptions, dot:!this._micromatchOptions.dot })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dot` property of the `micromatchOptions` object is inverted, which could lead to different pattern matching results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
utils.pattern.convertPatternsToRe(positive, this._micromatchOptions)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `positive` patterns are used instead of the `negative` patterns, which would lead to incorrect filtering results.

DONE.
