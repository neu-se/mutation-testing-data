Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.unshift({ insert: 'default' });
```
This would result in different behavior because it inserts a new operation with a default string instead of the intended `newOp`, potentially altering the sequence of operations and their effects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.unshift(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert `newOp` at the beginning of the operations array instead of the intended position, which could change the order of operations and their cumulative effects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.unshift({ delete: 1 });
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a delete operation with a fixed length of 1 instead of the intended `newOp`, which could lead to unintended deletions in the operation sequence.

DONE.
