  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method returns the length of the current operation, but adding 1 to it would cause the `hasNext` method to return `true` even if the iterator is at the end of the operation list, leading to an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method returns the length of the current operation, but subtracting 1 from it would cause the `hasNext` method to return `false` even if the iterator is not at the end of the operation list, leading to a missing operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ops` property is a list of operations, and the `length` property returns the number of operations in the list. If the `peekLength
