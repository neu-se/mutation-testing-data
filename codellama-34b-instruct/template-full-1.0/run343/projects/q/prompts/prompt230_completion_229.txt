  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op === "when" && !operands[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `operands[1]` would be treated as a falsy value instead of a truthy value, which would cause the `progressListeners` to be populated with `undefined` instead of the actual progress value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op === "when" && operands[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `operands[0]` would be treated as a truthy value instead of the actual progress value, which would cause the `progressListeners` to be populated with the incorrect progress value.
