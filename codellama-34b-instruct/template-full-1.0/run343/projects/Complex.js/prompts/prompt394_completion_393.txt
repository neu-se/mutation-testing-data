  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment computes the absolute value of `a`, while replacing it with `-a` would compute the negative value of `a` instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a*a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment computes the square root of `a`, while replacing it with `a*a` would compute the square of `a` instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b/a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment computes the ratio of `b` to `a`, while replacing it with `b/a` would compute the ratio of `a` to `b` instead.

DONE.
