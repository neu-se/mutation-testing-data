  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const { regex, props } = compile(spec)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compile` function is not being called with the correct arguments. The `spec` argument is a string, but the `compile` function expects an object with a `spec` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const { regex, props } = compile({ spec })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compile` function is being called with an object that has a `spec` property, but the `spec` property is not being set to the correct value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const { regex, props } = compile({ spec: spec })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compile` function is being called with an object that has a `spec` property, but the `spec` property is not being set to the correct value.

DONE.
