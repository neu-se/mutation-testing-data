  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would return a rejected promise with the error "Cannot read property 'then' of undefined".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would return a rejected promise with the error "Cannot read property 'then' of null".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would return a rejected promise with the error "Cannot read property 'then' of 'hello'".

DONE.
