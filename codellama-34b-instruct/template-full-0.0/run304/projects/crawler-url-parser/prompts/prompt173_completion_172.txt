  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.error
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.error` would log the message to the console with a higher level of severity, which could potentially cause the test to fail if it is checking for the correct logging behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("different message")
```
This would result in different behavior because the message being logged is different from the original message, which could potentially cause the test to fail if it is checking for the correct message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the message being logged is `null`, which could potentially cause the test to fail if it is checking for a non-null message.

DONE.
