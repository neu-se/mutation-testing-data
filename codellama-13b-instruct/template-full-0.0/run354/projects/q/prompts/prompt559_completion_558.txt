  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isStopIteration(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to throw a `StopIteration` exception when the generator is stopped, rather than returning a `ReturnValue` exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isReturnValue(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to throw a `ReturnValue` exception when the generator is stopped, rather than returning a `StopIteration` exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isException(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to throw an `Exception` exception when the generator is stopped, rather than returning a `ReturnValue` or `StopIteration` exception.

DONE.
