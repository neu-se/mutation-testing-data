  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 1, baseIndex + length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseIndex + 1` would cause the `slice` method to start at the next index instead of the current index, which could result in a different set of operations being transformed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex + length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length - 1` would cause the `slice` method to end one index earlier than the original code, which could result in a different set of operations being transformed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex + length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length + 1` would cause the `slice` method to end one index later than the original code, which could result in a different set of operations being transformed.

DONE.
