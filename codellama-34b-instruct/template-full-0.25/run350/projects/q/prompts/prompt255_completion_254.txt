  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise, message[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the first element of the `message` array as the second argument to `promiseDispatch`, instead of passing the entire `message` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise, message.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `message` array without its first element as the second argument to `promiseDispatch`, instead of passing the entire `message` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise, message.concat(newPromise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a concatenation of the `message` array and the `newPromise` object as the second argument to `promiseDispatch`, instead of passing the `message` array and the `newPromise` object as separate arguments.

DONE.
