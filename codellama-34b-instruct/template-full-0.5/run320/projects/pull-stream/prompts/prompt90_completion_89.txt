  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `test` function, so it would return `true` if the `test` function returned `false`, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data) || false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator returns the first operand if it is truthy, and the second operand otherwise. So if `test(data)` returns a truthy value, the `||` operator would return `true`, and if it returns a falsy value, the `||` operator would return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data) && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator returns the first operand if it is falsy, and the second operand otherwise. So if `test(data)` returns a falsy value, the `
