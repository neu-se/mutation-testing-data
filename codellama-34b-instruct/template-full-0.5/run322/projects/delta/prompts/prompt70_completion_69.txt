  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes != null &&
      typeof attributes === 'object' &&
      Object.keys(attributes).length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `Object.keys(attributes).length` is greater than 0, while this new code checks if it is greater than 1. This means that if the `attributes` object has only one key, the original code would consider it empty, while this new code would consider it non-empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes != null &&
      typeof attributes === 'object' &&
      Object.keys(attributes).length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `Object.keys(attributes).length` is greater than 0, while this new code checks if it is equal to 0. This means that if the `attributes` object has any keys, the original code would consider it non-empty, while this new code would consider it empty.

Option 3: The PL
