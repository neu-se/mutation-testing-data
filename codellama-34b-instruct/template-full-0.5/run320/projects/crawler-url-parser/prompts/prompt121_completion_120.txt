  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[].concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.from` is a method that creates a new array from an array-like or iterable object, while `[].concat` is a method that creates a new array by concatenating two or more arrays.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Set.from
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.from` is a method that creates a new array from an array-like or iterable object, while `Set.from` is a method that creates a new set from an iterable object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Map.from
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.from` is a method that creates a new array from an array-like or iterable object, while `Map.from` is a method that creates a new map from an iterable object.

DONE.
