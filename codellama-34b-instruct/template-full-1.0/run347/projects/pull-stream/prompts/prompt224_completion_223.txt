  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` regardless of the value of `data`, whereas the original code fragment only returns `true` if `test(data)` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test(data);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` regardless of the value of `data`, whereas the original code fragment only returns `false` if `test(data)` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data) && data;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `data` only if `test(data)` is truthy, whereas the original code fragment always returns `data`.

DONE.
