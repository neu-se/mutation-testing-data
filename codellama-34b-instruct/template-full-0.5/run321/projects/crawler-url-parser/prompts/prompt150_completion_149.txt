  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"/"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `split()` method to split the string at every forward slash, regardless of whether it is followed by a space or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\/"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `split()` method to split the string at every forward slash, regardless of whether it is followed by a space or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\s+"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `split()` method to split the string at every sequence of one or more whitespace characters, regardless of whether it is followed by a forward slash or not.

DONE.
