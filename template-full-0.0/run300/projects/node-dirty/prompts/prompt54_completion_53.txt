  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is called immediately, rather than being called when the `drain` event is emitted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('drain'));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is called with a different event name and error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', this._data.size);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is called with a different number of arguments.

DONE.
