  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `id` is a valid identifier, while `null` is a null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `id` is a valid identifier, while `undefined` is a undefined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"id"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `id` is a valid identifier, while `"id"` is a string.

DONE.
