 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"nonexistentMethod", []
```
This would result in different behavior because it references a nonexistent method, causing a `TypeError` when the code is executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"keys", "someString"
