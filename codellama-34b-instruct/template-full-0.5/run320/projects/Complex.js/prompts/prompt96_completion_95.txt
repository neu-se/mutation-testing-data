  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['NAN'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would have returned a complex number with the real part equal to 0 and the imaginary part equal to the parsed value, while the modified code would return a complex number with both real and imaginary parts equal to NaN.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['INFINITY'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would have returned a complex number with the real part equal to the parsed value and the imaginary part equal to 0, while the modified code would return a complex number with both real and imaginary parts equal to Infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(0, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would have returned a complex number with the real part equal to the parsed value and the imaginary part equal to 0, while the modified code would return a complex number with both real and
