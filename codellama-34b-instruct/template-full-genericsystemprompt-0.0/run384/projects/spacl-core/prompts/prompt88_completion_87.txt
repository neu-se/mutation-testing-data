  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.filter(policy => policy.name)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method returns a new array with only the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, while the `map` method returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.reduce((acc, policy) => acc.set(policy.name, policy), new Map())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce` method applies a function against an accumulator and each element in the array (from left to right) to reduce it to a single value, while the `map` method returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.find(policy => policy.name)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `find` method returns
