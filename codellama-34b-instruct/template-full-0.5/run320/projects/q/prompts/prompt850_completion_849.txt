  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error && "string" === typeof error
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than the `!` operator, so the `!error` expression would be evaluated first, and then the result would be compared to `"string" === typeof error`. This would lead to a different outcome in cases where `error` is a truthy value that is not a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!error || "string" !== typeof error
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator has a higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the `!error` expression would be evaluated first, and then the result would be compared to `"string" !== typeof error`. This would lead to a different outcome in cases where `error` is a falsy value that is not a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

error || "string" !== typeof error
