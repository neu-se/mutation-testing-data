  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delete tzs[key].deprecated;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `Object.assign()` method to create a new object with the `deprecated` property set to `false`, while the new code fragment uses the `delete` keyword to remove the `deprecated` property from the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzs[key].deprecated = true;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `||` operator to set the `deprecated` property to `true` only if it is currently `false`, while the new code fragment always sets the `deprecated` property to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzs[key].timezones = tzs[key].timezones.filter(tz => !tz.deprecated);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `map` method to
