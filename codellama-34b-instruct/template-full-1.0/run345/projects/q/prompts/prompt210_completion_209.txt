  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has higher precedence than the square brackets notation for accessing array elements. [2]

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`[Number(2)]`
```
This would result in different behavior because the cast to Number would prevent the fragment from being interpreted as an array element accessor. [3]

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`[*2]`
```
This would result in different behavior because the asterisk token indicates that the proceeding number should be used as a an indefinite argument count, not as an array element accessor. [4]

DONE.
