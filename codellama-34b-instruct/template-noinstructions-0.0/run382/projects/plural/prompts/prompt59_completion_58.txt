  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criteria'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was 'criterion', which is the singular form of the word, while 'criteria' is the plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterion'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was 'criteria', which is the plural form of the word, while 'criterion' is the singular form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterion'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was 'criteria', which is the plural form of the word, while 'criterion' is the singular form.

DONE.
