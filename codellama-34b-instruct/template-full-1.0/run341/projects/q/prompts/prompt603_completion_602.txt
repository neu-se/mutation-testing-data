  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer().get(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `.get(0)` changes the returned value from a Deferred object to the first element of the Deferred's wrapped array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer().promise()
```
This would result in different behavior because `.promise()` changes the returned value from a Deferred object to a Promise object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
foo
```
where `foo` is a Deferred object. This would produce a different result because `foo.get(0)` would throw an error, while `defer().get(0)` would silently fail and return `undefined`.

DONE.
