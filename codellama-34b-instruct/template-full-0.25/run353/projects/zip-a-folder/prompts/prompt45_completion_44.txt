  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `src`, which would cause the `directory` method to operate on a different directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first character of the `src` string, which would cause the `directory` method to operate on a different directory.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the `src` string to uppercase, which would cause the `directory` method to operate on a different directory.

DONE.
