  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
hasStacks &&
        promise.stack &&
        typeof error === "object" &&
        error !== null &&
        error.stack &&
        false
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `&& false` would cause the expression to always evaluate to `false`, even if the original expression would have been `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
hasStacks &&
        promise.stack &&
        typeof error === "object" &&
        error !== null &&
        error.stack ||
        true
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `|| true` would cause the expression to always evaluate to `true`, even if the original expression would have been `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
hasStacks &&
        promise.stack &&
        typeof error === "object" &&
        error !== null &&
        error.stack &&
        typeof error.stack === "string"
```
This would result
