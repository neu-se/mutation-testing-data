  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, ref
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is treated as a falsey value, so the `null` check would not be triggered.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, []
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array `[]` is not equal to `ref`, so the condition `args == null` would be true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, ref.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref.length` returns the number of elements in the `ref` array, so the condition `args == null` would be true if the `ref` array is empty.

DONE.
