  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeStackTraceLong` function is not called with the `reason` parameter, which could result in a different stack trace being generated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.reject(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reason` parameter is not passed to the `reject` method, which could result in the promise being rejected with a different reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error, error
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` variable is being passed to both the `reject` method and the `makeStackTraceLong` function, which could result in a different stack trace being generated.

DONE.
