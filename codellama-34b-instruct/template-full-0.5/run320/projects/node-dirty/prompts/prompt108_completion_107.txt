  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the code to check if the length of the buffer is greater than 1, rather than checking if it is equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, rather than the `!=` operator which checks for inequality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `>` operator checks if the length of the buffer is greater than 0, rather than checking if it is equal to 0.

DONE.
