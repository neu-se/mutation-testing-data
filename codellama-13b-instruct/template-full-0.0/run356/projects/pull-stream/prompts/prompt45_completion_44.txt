  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read && typeof read.source === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `read` object has a `source` property that is a function, while the new code fragment checks if the `read` object has a `source` property that is a function and is truthy. This could potentially cause different behavior in certain cases where the `read` object has a `source` property that is not a function but is still truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read && typeof read.source === 'function' && read.source()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `read` object has a `source` property that is a function, while the new code fragment checks if the `read` object has a `source` property that is a function and is truthy, and then calls the `source` function if it is truthy. This could potentially cause different behavior in certain cases where the `read` object has a `source` property that
