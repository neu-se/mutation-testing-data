  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base
```
This change will cause the `invert` function to always return an empty object, as `base` is an empty object and `attr` is never modified.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attr[key]
```
This change will cause the `invert` function to always return the value of the `attr` object, as `base` is never used.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base[key]
```
This change will cause the `invert` function to always return the value of the `base` object, as `attr` is never used.

DONE.
