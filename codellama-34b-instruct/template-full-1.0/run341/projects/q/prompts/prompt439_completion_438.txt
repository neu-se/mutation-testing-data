  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.catch(fake)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would handle the promise rejection instead of ignoring it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nextTick
```
This would result in different behavior because it would schedule the task for the next tick instead of running it immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => process.exit()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exit the process instead of reporting the unhandled rejection.

DONE.
