  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseArgs.concat` returns a new array with the elements of both arrays, while `baseArgs.pop` removes the last element of the array and returns it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseArgs.concat` returns a new array with the elements of both arrays, while `baseArgs.shift` removes the first element of the array and returns it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseArgs.concat` returns a new array with the elements of both arrays, while `baseArgs.slice(0, 1)` returns a new array with the first element of the original array.

DONE.
