  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method is being called without an argument, which would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'] = true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` property is being set to `true`, which would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'] = false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` property is being set to `false`, which would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`.

DONE.
