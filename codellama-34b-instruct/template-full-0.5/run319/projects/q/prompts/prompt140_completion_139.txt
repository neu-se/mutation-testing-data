  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!p
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would return the opposite of the original value, which would cause the loop to run indefinitely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would run only once, since `p` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p && !p
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would run only once, since `p && !p` is falsy.

DONE.
