  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function is called with an argument, which would cause it to return a rejected promise instead of a resolved one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function is called with a function argument, which would cause it to return a resolved promise with the function as the value instead of a resolved promise with the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function is called with a null argument, which would cause it to return a rejected promise instead of a resolved one.

DONE.
