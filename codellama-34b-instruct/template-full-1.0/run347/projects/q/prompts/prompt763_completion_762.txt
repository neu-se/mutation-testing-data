  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises[0], Q
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first promise in the array, whereas the original code fragment considers all promises in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises[2], Q
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider a different promise in the array than the original code fragment, which could lead to a different outcome if the promises have different resolutions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reference a different variable than the original code fragment, which could lead to a different outcome if the promises have different resolutions.

DONE.
