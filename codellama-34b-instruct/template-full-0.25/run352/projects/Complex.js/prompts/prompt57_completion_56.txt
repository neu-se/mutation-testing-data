  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'r' in a && 'phi' in b
```
This would result in different behavior because the check is now performed on the `b` object instead of the `a` object, which may not have the same properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'r' in b && 'phi' in a
```
This would result in different behavior because the check is now performed on the `b` object instead of the `a` object, which may not have the same properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'r' in a && 'phi' in a
```
This would result in different behavior because the check is now performed on the `a` object, which may not have the same properties as the original `a` object.

DONE.
