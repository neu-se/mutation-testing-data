  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{src, targetFilePath: tarFilePath, format: 'zip', zipAFolderOptions}
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it changes the `format` property from `'tar'` to `'zip'`. This could cause the `tar` function to create a zip file instead of a tar file, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{src, targetFilePath: tarFilePath, format: 'tar', zipAFolderOptions: {compression: COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed}}
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it changes the `zipAFolderOptions` object to use the `COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed` value instead of the default `COMPRESSION_LEVEL.high`. This could cause the `tar` function to create an uncompressed tar file, which could be larger and take longer to transfer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced
