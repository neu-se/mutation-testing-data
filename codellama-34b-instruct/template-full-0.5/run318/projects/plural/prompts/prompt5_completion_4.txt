  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` is a different method than `call`, and it accepts an array of arguments as its second argument, whereas `call` accepts a list of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` is a different method than `call`, and it returns a new function that is bound to the provided `this` value, whereas `call` invokes the function immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.name
```
This would result in different behavior because `name` is a property that returns the name of the function, whereas `call` is a method that invokes the function.

DONE.
