 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` returns the cosine of a number, while `cosh` returns the hyperbolic cosine of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cosh(a + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the input `a` before calculating the hyperbolic cosine, which is not equivalent to the original `cosh(a)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.re * this.re - this.im * this.im
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the square of the real part minus the square of the imaginary part, instead of calculating the square of the norm of the complex number.

DONE.
