Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'w'
```
This would result in different behavior because the file would be opened in write mode instead of read mode, potentially causing data loss or corruption if the file is not intended to be written to.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the file would be opened in append mode instead of read mode, potentially causing unexpected behavior if the file is not intended to be appended to.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'wx'
```
This would result in different behavior because the file would be opened in exclusive creation mode instead of read mode, potentially causing an error if the file already exists, and also allowing write access.

DONE.
