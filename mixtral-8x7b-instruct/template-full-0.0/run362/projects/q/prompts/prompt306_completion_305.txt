 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
answerPs.forEach(function (answerP) {
    Q(answerP).then(resolve, reject);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `forEach` loop, which is not supported in older browsers. The original code uses a traditional `for` loop, which is more widely supported.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
for (let i = 0, len = answerPs.length; i < len; i++) {
    Q(answerPs[i]).then(resolve, reject);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `let` keyword, which is not supported in older browsers. The original code uses the `var` keyword, which is more widely supported.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
for (i = 0, len = answerPs.length; i < len; i++) {
    Q(answerPs[i]).then(
