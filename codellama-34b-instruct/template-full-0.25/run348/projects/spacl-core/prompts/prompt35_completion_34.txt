  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part of spec.split('/').slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method is removed, causing the parts to be returned in the wrong order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part of spec.split('/').slice(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method is called with a different argument, causing the parts to be returned starting from a different index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part of spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().join('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method is called on the array of parts, causing them to be returned in the opposite order, and the `join()` method is called with a separator of `'/'`, causing the parts to be joined together with a different separator.

DONE.
