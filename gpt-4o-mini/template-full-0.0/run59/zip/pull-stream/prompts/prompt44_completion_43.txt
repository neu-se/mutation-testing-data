Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, ref
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` instead of `null` may lead to different handling of the arguments in the `pull` function, potentially causing unexpected behavior when the function is invoked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.length, ref
```
This would result in different behavior because using `ref.length` instead of `null` changes the first argument to a number representing the length of the `ref` array, which could lead to incorrect argument handling in the recursive call to `pull`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0], ref
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `ref[0]` (the first element of the `ref` array) instead of `null` changes the first argument to a specific value from the array, which may alter the expected behavior of the `pull` function when it processes the arguments.

DONE.
