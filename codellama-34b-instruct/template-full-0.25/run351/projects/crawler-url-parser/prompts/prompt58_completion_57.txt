  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would return `null` instead of an object with the parsed URL, which would cause the `extract` function to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!parsedUrl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would return an object with the parsed URL, but the `protocol` property would be set to `null`, which would cause the `extract` function to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.protocol == 'http:'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would return an object with the parsed URL, but the `protocol` property would be set to `'http:'`, which would cause the `extract` function to fail.

DONE.
