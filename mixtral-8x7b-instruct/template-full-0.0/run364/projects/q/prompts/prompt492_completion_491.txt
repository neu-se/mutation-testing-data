 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function checks if the promise passed to it is the same as the one in the `unhandledRejections` array. By replacing `this` with `null`, the comparison will always be false, and the rejection will not be untracked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is a new object, which is different from the promise object in the `unhandledRejections` array. The `untrackRejection` function will not find the promise in the array, and the rejection will not be untracked.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q` is the promise library object, which is not a rejected promise. The `untrackRejection` function expects a rejected promise, and replacing `this` with `Q
