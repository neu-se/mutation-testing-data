  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not call the `predicate` function at all, which was the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, {}, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different value for the `index` parameter, which could affect the behavior of the `predicate` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.forEach(() => {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the `other.ops` array using a different method, which could affect the behavior of the `invert` function.

DONE.
