  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isObject && !Array.isArray(object.coordinates)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `object` is an object and has a `coordinates` property, while the modified code fragment also checks if `object.coordinates` is not an array. This would cause the `fromObject` method to throw a `TypeError` if `object.coordinates` is an array, even if `object` is an object and has a `coordinates` property.
