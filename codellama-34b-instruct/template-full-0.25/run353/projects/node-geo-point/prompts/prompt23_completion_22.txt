  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'longitude'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromObject` method would be checking for the presence of the `longitude` property instead of the `latitude` property, which could cause the method to return an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'latitude' + 'longitude'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromObject` method would be checking for the presence of a property that is the concatenation of `latitude` and `longitude`, which would not be present in the input object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'latitude' * 'longitude'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromObject` method would be checking for the presence of a property that is the product of `latitude` and `longitude`, which would not be present in the input object.

DONE.
