  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `[[Prototype]]` of the new object created by `Q.resolve` would be `Object.prototype` instead of `Promise.prototype`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `[[Prototype]]` of the new object created by `Q.resolve` would be `Object.prototype` instead of `Promise.prototype`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"test"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `[[Prototype]]` of the new object created by `Q.resolve` would be `String.prototype` instead of `Promise.prototype`.

DONE.
