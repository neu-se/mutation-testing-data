Your task is to apply mutation testing to the following code:
```
'use strict'
module.exports = function infinite (generate) {
  generate = generate || Math.random
  return function (end, cb) {
    if(end) return cb && cb(end)
    return cb(null, <PLACEHOLDER>())
  }
}



```

by replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different
behavior than the original code fragment, which was:
```
generate
```
Please consider changes such as using different operators, changing constants,
referring to different variables, object properties, functions, or methods.  

Provide your answer as a fenced code block containing a single line of code,
using the following template:

The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Please conclude your response with "DONE."
