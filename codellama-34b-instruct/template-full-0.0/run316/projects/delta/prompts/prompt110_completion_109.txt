  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.insert` is a string, while `op` is an object with an `insert` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.retain` is a number, while `op` is an object with a `retain` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.delete` is a number, while `op` is an object with a `delete` property.

DONE.
