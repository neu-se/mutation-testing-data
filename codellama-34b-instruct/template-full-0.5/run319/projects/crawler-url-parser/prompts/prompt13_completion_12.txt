  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!https?:)\/\//, 'http://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces only the protocol with "http://", while this code fragment replaces only the protocol with "http://" if it is not already "https:".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!https?:\/\/)/i, 'http://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces only the protocol with "http://", while this code fragment replaces only the protocol with "http://" if it is not already "https?://".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!https?:\/\/)/i, 'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces only the protocol with "http://", while this code fragment replaces only the protocol with "https://" if it is not already "https?://".
