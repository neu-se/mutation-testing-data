  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `nextOp.retain` is a number, while this new code checks if it is a string. This could cause the code to behave differently if `nextOp.retain` is a string, as the code would not execute the expected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `nextOp.retain` is a number, while this new code checks if it is not a number. This could cause the code to behave differently if `nextOp.retain` is not a number, as the code would not execute the expected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.retain === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `nextOp.retain` is a number, while this
