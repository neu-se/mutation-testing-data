  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Math.cos```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function is used instead of `sin`, which would change the resulting value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Math.sin(a)```
This would result in different behavior because the `a` variable is used as the input to `sin`, which would change the resulting value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Math.sinh(b)```
This would result in different behavior because the `b` variable is used as the input to `sinh`, which would change the resulting value.

DONE.
