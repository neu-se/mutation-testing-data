  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.calculateDistance
```
This would result in different behavior because `calculateDistance` and `calculateBearing` are two different methods that perform different calculations, and using one in place of the other would cause the code to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.calculateDistance(point, bearing)
```
This would result in different behavior because `calculateDistance` takes two arguments, `point` and `bearing`, while `calculateBearing` takes only one argument, `point`. Using `calculateDistance` with two arguments in place of `calculateBearing` would cause the code to produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.calculateDistance(point, bearing, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `calculateDistance` takes three arguments, `point`, `bearing`, and `distance`, while `calculateB
