  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].current.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end. This change would cause the `current` property of the `result` object to have a different value than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].all.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end. This change would cause the `all` property of the `result` object to have a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].all.push(tz.r)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the value of `tz.r` to the `all` property of the `result` object, whereas the original code only adds the value of
