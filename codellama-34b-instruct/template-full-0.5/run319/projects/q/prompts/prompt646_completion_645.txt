  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.bind(this)` returns a new function that is bound to the `this` context of the current function, whereas `this.dispatch` would refer to the original function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.call(this)` would call the `dispatch` method immediately, whereas `this.dispatch` would refer to the original function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.apply(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.apply(this)` would call the `dispatch` method immediately, whereas `this.dispatch` would refer to the original function.

DONE.
