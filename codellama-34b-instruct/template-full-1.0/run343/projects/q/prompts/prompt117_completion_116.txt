  Mutation Testing:
===========================

You have decided to apply mutation testing to the code to find weaknesses in the test suite. Your job is to make small changes to the code in order to find weaknesses in its test suite.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self
```
This would result in the same behavior because the PLACEHOLDER is already replacing the `self` reference in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` and `self` are different keywords in JavaScript.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an object and does not have any properties.

DONE.
