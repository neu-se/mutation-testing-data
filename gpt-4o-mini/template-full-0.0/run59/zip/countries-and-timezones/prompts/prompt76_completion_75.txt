Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks specifically for `null` instead of any falsy value, which means that if `timezone` is `undefined` or an empty object, the condition would evaluate to `false`, allowing the memoization to proceed incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!timezone.name
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `name` property of `timezone` is falsy, which would prevent memoization if the `timezone` object exists but does not have a valid `name`, potentially leading to missing timezones in the `timezones` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone && timezone.name === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `timezone` exists and if its `name` property is an empty string. This would allow memoization to occur for any `timezone` object that has a non-empty `name`, which could lead to incorrect behavior if the intention was to skip memoization for invalid or empty timezones.

DONE.
