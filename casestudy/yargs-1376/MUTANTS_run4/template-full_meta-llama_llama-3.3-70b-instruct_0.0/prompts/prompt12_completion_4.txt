Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
config, 'extend'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the existence of a property named 'extend' instead of 'extends', potentially allowing configurations with an 'extend' property to bypass the extend logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
defaultConfig, 'extends'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the 'defaultConfig' object for the 'extends' property instead of the 'config' object, potentially causing the function to incorrectly handle configurations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
config, 'extends' === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it always evaluates to false due to the strict equality check, effectively disabling the extend logic and always returning the original 'config'.

DONE.
