  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3, -2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first three characters of the string instead of starting from the eighth character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2, -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would start from the second to last character instead of the seventh character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
8, -2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the last two characters instead of only the last one.

DONE.
