  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10, places || 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would always return `1`, causing the `Math.pow` function to always return `10`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10, places + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add `1` to the `places` variable, causing the `Math.pow` function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10, places * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would multiply `places` by `2`, causing the `Math.pow` function to return a different value.

DONE.
