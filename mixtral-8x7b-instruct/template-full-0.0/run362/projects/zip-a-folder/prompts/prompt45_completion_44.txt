 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'./'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the directory path to the current directory, which may not be the intended behavior when compressing a given folder or a glob.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
zipArchive
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes the `archiver` object instead of the `src` directory path, which would cause the `zipArchive.directory()` method to fail since it expects a string as its first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
zipAFolderOptions
