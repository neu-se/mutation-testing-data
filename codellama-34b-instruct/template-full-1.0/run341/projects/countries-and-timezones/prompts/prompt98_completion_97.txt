  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deprecated` property is never set to `true`, so the original code would always return the full list of timezones.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deprecated.customProp
```
This would result in different behavior because the `customProp` property does not exist on the `deprecated` object, so the original code would always return `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizedTimezones.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `memoizedTimezones` array is never modified in the original code, so the condition would always be `false`.

DONE.
