  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is equal to 0, while the new code fragment checks if `a` is not equal to 0. This change would cause the code to behave differently when `a` is equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is equal to 0, while the new code fragment checks if `b` is not equal to 0. This change would cause the code to behave differently when `b` is equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` and `b` are both equal to 0, while the new code fragment checks if their sum is not equal to 0. This change would cause the code to behave differently
