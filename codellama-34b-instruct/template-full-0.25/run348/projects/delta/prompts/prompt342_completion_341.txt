  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const baseOp = new OpIterator(slice.ops).next(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `0` as the argument to `next()`, which returns the first element of the slice, while the replaced code fragment uses `1` as the argument, which returns the second element of the slice.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const baseOp = new OpIterator(slice.ops).next(slice.length - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `0` as the argument to `next()`, which returns the first element of the slice, while the replaced code fragment uses `slice.length - 1` as the argument, which returns the last element of the slice.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const baseOp = new OpIterator(slice.ops).next(slice.length);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `0` as
