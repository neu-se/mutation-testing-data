  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return test(data) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical NOT operator (!) to negate the result of the `test` function, while the new code fragment does not use any logical operators and simply returns the result of the `test` function.

DONE.
