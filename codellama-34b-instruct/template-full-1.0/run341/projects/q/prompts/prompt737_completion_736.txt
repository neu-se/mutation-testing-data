  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `all` function to return a resolved promise with an empty array as its value, even if the input array contains rejected promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `all` function to return a rejected promise with an Error object as its reason, if the input array contains any rejected promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length === promises.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `all` function to return a resolved promise with an array of the fulfilled values of the input promises, even if the input array contains rejected promises.

DONE.
