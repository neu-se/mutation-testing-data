  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPromise` function would return `false` for `null`, and the `isRejected` function would return `false` for a fulfilled promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPromise` function would return `false` for `undefined`, and the `isRejected` function would return `false` for a fulfilled promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPromise` function would return `false` for an object, and the `isRejected` function would return `false` for a fulfilled promise.

DONE.
