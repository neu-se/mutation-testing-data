  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFile).catch(() => {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment catches errors and throws them, but this code fragment catches errors and does nothing with them, potentially hiding errors and causing the code to fail silently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFile).then(() => {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value returned by `fs.readFile`, but this code fragment does not use the value returned by `fs.readFile`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFile)()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value returned by `fs.readFile`, but this code fragment does not use the value returned by `fs.writeFile`. Additionally, the original code fragment uses the `universalify.from
