  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throughs.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the `throughs` array, which is not the same as simply referring to the `throughs` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throughs.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop()` method removes the last element from the `throughs` array, which is not the same as simply referring to the `throughs` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throughs.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `shift()` method removes the first element from the `throughs` array, which is not the same as simply referring to the `throughs` array.

DONE.
