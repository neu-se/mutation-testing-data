  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(null, null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with a value of `null`, regardless of the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(null, null, function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with a value of `undefined`, regardless of the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(null, null, function(value) { return value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the original value, regardless of the original value.

DONE.
