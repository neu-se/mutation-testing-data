  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `abort` variable, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `abort` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && value
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator evaluates both operands and returns the second operand if the first operand is truthy, or `false` if the first operand is falsy. In this case, if `abort` is `true`, the `if` statement would evaluate to `value`, which could be any value, including `null` or `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || value
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator evaluates both operands and returns the first operand if it is truthy, or the second operand if the first operand is falsy.
