  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_concat` returns a new array containing the concatenation of all the arguments passed to it, while `array_slice` returns a new array containing a slice of the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_map
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_map` applies a function to each element of the original array and returns a new array containing the results, while `array_slice` returns a new array containing a slice of the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_filter` returns a new array containing the elements of the original array that pass a test implemented by a given function, while `array_slice` returns a new array containing a slice of the original array.

DONE.
