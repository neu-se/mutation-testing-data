  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce` method would return `undefined` instead of the initial value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce` method would return `null` instead of the initial value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce` method would return `0` instead of the initial value.

DONE.
