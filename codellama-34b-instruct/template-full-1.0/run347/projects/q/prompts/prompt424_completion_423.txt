  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!object.inspect().state === "fulfilled";
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check whether the state is not equal to "fulfilled", instead of checking whether it is equal to "fulfilled".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state !== "fulfilled";
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check whether the state is not equal to "fulfilled", instead of checking whether it is equal to "fulfilled".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(object.inspect().state === "fulfilled");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check whether the state is not equal to "fulfilled", instead of checking whether it is equal to "fulfilled".

DONE.
