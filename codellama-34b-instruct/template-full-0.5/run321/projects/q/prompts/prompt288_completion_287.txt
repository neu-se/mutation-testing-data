  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("something went wrong"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to reject with an error message, rather than resolve with a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to resolve with an undefined value, rather than a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(progress);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to notify progress, rather than resolve or reject.

DONE.
