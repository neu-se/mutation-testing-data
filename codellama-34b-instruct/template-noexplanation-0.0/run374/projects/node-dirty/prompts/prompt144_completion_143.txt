  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites < 0 && !this._waitForDrain
```
This change will cause the `drain` event to be emitted when the number of in-flight writes is less than zero, which is a different behavior than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites <= 0 || !this._waitForDrain
```
This change will cause the `drain` event to be emitted when the number of in-flight writes is less than or equal to zero, or when the `waitForDrain` flag is set to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites <= 0 && !this._waitForDrain
```
This change will cause the `drain` event to be emitted when the number of in-flight writes is less than or equal to zero, and the `waitForDrain` flag
