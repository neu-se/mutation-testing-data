 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.on('data', function(data) { nextChunk(data) })
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly triggers the `nextChunk` function with the 'data' event's data, bypassing the original event listener.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.destroy()
```
This would result in different behavior because it immediately destroys the stream, which might not be handled correctly by the rest of the code, leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(nextChunk, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a delay in processing the next chunk, which might not be expected by the rest of the code, potentially causing issues with synchronization or buffering.

DONE.
