  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be adding 1 to the length of the peeked operation, potentially causing the code to skip over a retain operation or to insert an extra character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be subtracting 1 from the length of the peeked operation, potentially causing the code to retain less characters than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be using the length of the peeked operation from the other iterator, potentially causing the code to use the wrong iterator or to use the wrong length.

DONE.
