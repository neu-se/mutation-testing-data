Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
val.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the text value to uppercase before building the text value node, whereas the original code leaves the text value unchanged.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.options.tagValueProcessor(key, val)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would apply the tag value processor function to the text value, which may modify it in some way, whereas the original code only replaces entities in the text value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
val.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first character of the text value before building the text value node, whereas the original code uses the entire text value.

DONE.
