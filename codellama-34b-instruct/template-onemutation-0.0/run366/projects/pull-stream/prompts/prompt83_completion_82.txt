  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(abort || true, done || function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only called the `read` function with the `abort` and `done` arguments if they were both truthy, while the new code fragment calls the `read` function with `abort` and `done` regardless of their truthiness. This could potentially cause the `read` function to be called with invalid arguments, leading to unexpected behavior.
