 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the AttributeMap.invert() method expects a second argument that is an object, and null is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
baseOpData.slice(0, baseOpData.length / 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the AttributeMap.invert() method expects the entire baseOpData object as its second argument, but instead it would receive only half of it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the AttributeMap.invert() method expects the baseOp's attributes as its second argument, but instead it would receive the current operation's attributes.

DONE.
