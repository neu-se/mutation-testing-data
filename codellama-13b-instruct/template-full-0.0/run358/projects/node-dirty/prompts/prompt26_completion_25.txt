  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('Empty lines never appear in a healthy database'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `load` event to be emitted with an error, rather than the number of loaded rows.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('Could not load corrupted row: ' + rowStr));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `load` event to be emitted with an error, rather than the number of loaded rows.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('Could not load corrupted row: ' + rowStr));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `load` event to be emitted with an error, rather than the number of loaded rows.

DONE.
