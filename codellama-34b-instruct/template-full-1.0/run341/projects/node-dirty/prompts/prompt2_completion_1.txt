  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this.path) {
  const cbs = this._queue.get(key) || [];
  if (cb) cbs.push(cb);
  this._queue.set(key, cbs);
  this._flush();
} else {
  setImmediate(() => { if (cb) cb(); this.emit('drain'); });
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `else` block would not be executed if `this.path` is not truthy, which could result in the `cb` callback being called multiple times or not at all.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this.path) {
  const cbs = this._queue.get(key) || [];
  if (cb) cbs.push(cb);
  this._queue.set(key, cbs);
  this._flush();
} else {
  this.emit('drain');
  if (cb) cb();
}
```
