  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `output.on('close', resolve)` event listener would not be triggered, causing the promise to never resolve or reject.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finish'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `output.on('finish', resolve)` event listener would be triggered, causing the promise to resolve even if the archive is not fully written.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `output.on('end', resolve)` event listener would be triggered, causing the promise to resolve even if the archive is not fully written.

DONE.
