  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` regardless of the value of `obj`, whereas the original code would return `true` if `obj` is `null` or `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` regardless of the value of `obj`, whereas the original code would return `false` if `obj` is `null` or `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if `obj` is `undefined`, whereas the original code would return `false` if `obj` is `null` or `undefined`.

DONE.
