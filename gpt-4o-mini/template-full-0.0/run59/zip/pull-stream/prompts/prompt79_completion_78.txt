Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly passes the `data` variable to the `next` function, which is not intended to receive any arguments, potentially leading to unexpected results or errors in the processing logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the `next` function to be called with `null`, which may cause the loop to terminate prematurely and skip processing of valid data, leading to incomplete execution of the stream handling logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes a boolean value `true` to the `next` function, which is not expected and could disrupt the intended flow of data processing, potentially causing logical errors in how the stream is handled.

DONE.
