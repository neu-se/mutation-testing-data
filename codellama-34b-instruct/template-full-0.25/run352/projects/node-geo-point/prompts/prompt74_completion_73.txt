  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(θ) + 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rad2deg` function converts radians to degrees, but adding 360 degrees would cause the result to be off by a multiple of 360 degrees.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ * 180 / Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.PI` constant is used to convert radians to degrees, but multiplying by 180 would cause the result to be off by a factor of 180.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ * 360 / (2 * Math.PI)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.PI` constant is used to convert radians to degrees, but multiplying by 360 and dividing by 2 would cause the result to be off by a factor of 360.
