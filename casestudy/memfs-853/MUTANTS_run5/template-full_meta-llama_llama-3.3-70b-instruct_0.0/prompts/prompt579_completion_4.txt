Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
link.getPath()
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the error message to display the path of the link instead of the filename, potentially affecting how the error is handled or logged.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
filename + ' does not exist'
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends a custom message to the filename, changing the error message's content and potentially affecting how the error is interpreted or displayed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.root.getPath()
```
This would result in different behavior because it displays the path of the root directory instead of the filename, potentially causing confusion or incorrect error handling due to the incorrect error message.

DONE.
