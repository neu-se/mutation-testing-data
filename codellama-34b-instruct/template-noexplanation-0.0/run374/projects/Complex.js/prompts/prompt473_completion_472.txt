  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This change will cause the `isNaN` function to return `true` when the imaginary part of the complex number is `NaN`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + this['im']
```
This change will cause the `isNaN` function to return `true` when the sum of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number is `NaN`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * this['im']
```
This change will cause the `isNaN` function to return `true` when the product of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number is `NaN`, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
