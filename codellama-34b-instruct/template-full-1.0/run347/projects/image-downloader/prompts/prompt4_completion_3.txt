  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.dest` is a string, and `undefined` is a primitive value. Comparing a string to `undefined` will always evaluate to `false`, even if the string is an empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!options.dest || options.dest.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `options.dest` is falsy or an empty string. This change would allow the code to continue execution even if `options.dest` is a valid file path, but an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest && options.dest.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `options.dest` is truthy and has a length greater than 0. This change would allow the code to continue execution only if `options.dest` is a valid file path that is not an
