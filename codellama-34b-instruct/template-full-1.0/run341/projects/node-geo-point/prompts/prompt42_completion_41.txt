  Sure! Here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with buggy code fragments:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function returns the cosine of an angle, whereas the original code fragment uses the `sin` function to return the sine of an angle.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atan2(point1Rad, point2Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because `atan2` returns the arctangent of two variables, whereas the original code fragment uses `atan2` with the `point1Rad` and `point2Rad` variables as inputs, but also uses the `b` and `c` variables.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(point1Rad) + deg2rad(point2Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deg2rad` function converts degrees to radians, whereas the original code fragment uses the `rad2
