  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb()
```
This change will cause the `abortCb` function to be called, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb = null
```
This change will set the `abortCb` variable to `null`, which will cause the `if` statement that checks its value to evaluate to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb = function() {}
```
This change will set the `abortCb` variable to an empty function, which will cause the `if` statement that checks its value to evaluate to `false`.

DONE.
