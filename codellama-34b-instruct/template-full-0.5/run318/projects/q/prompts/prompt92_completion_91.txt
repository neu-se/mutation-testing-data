  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for exactly one argument, while this fragment checks for more than one argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for exactly one argument, while this fragment checks for zero arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!arguments.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for exactly one argument, while this fragment checks for a falsy value, which could be any number of arguments, including zero.

DONE.
