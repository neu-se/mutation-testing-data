  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new OpIterator(slice.ops).next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method is called on the `OpIterator` object, which would advance the iterator to the next operation in the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new OpIterator(slice.ops).peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek()` method is called on the `OpIterator` object, which would return the next operation in the delta without advancing the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new OpIterator(slice.ops).hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasNext()` method is called on the `OpIterator` object, which would return a boolean indicating whether there are more operations in the delta.

DONE.
