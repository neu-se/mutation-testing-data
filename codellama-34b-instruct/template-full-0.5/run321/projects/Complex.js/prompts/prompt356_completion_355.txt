  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `b + 1` is always positive, while `b` can be negative, which would change the result of the `Math.sqrt` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `b * 2` is always twice the value of `b`, while `b` can be any value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `b - 1` is always one less than `b`, while `b` can be any value.

DONE.
