  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' && thisIter.peekLength() <= firstLeft) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next operation is an insert and its length is less than or equal to the first left, but this new code fragment checks if the next operation is an insert and its length is less than the first left.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (thisIter.peekType() === 'delete' && thisIter.peekLength() <= firstLeft) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next operation is a delete and its length is less than or equal to the first left, but this new code fragment checks if the next operation is an insert and its length is less than the first left.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (thisIter.peekType() === 'retain' && thisIter.peekLength() <=
