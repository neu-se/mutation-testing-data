  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a*a) - (b*b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `+`, while the suggested replacement uses `-`. This would cause the function to return a different value for the hypotenuse in cases where the input values are negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `a*a + b*b`, while the suggested replacement uses `0`. This would cause the function to always return `0` as the hypotenuse, regardless of the input values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b*b - a*a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `a*a + b*b`, while the suggested replacement uses `b*b - a*a`. This would cause the function to return a different value for the hypotenuse in cases where the input values are swapped.

DONE.
