  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `test` function, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if the `test` function returned `true`, which would lead to incorrect behavior in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data+1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `data+1` expression adds 1 to the original `data` value, which would cause the `test` function to evaluate to a different result, leading to incorrect behavior in the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `data-1` expression subtracts 1 from the original `data` value, which would cause the `test` function to evaluate to a different result, leading to incorrect behavior in the program.

DONE.
