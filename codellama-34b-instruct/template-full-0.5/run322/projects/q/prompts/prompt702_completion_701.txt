  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.bind(null, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that returns a new array with a subset of the elements of the original array, whereas `array_slice.bind(null, arguments)` is a function that returns a new function that, when called, returns a new array with a subset of the elements of the original array, but the elements are the arguments passed to the function, not the elements of the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.bind(null, arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.bind(null, arguments, 1)` is a function that returns a new array with a subset of the elements of the original array, but the elements are the arguments passed to the function starting from the second argument, not the first.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.bind(null, arguments, 2
