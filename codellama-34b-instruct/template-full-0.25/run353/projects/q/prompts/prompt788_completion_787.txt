  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was expecting a value, but `null` is a falsy value that would cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was expecting a value, but `undefined` is a falsy value that would cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject("error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was expecting a value, but `Q.reject()` would cause the promise to be rejected with the specified error message.

DONE.
