 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the accumulator value would be overwritten with the callback function, instead of the reduced value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc += cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the accumulator value would be incremented by the callback function, instead of being updated with the reduced value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = reducer(acc, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the accumulator value would be updated by passing the callback function as the second argument to the reducer function, instead of the current data value.

DONE.
