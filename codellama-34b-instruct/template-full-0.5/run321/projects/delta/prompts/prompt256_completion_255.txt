  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisOp.insert === typeof otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for equality between the `insert` properties of the two ops, while this code checks only for the same type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert === otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for equality between the `insert` properties of the two ops, while this code checks for strict equality (i.e., both the value and the type must be the same).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert !== otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for equality between the `insert` properties of the two ops, while this code checks for inequality.

DONE.
