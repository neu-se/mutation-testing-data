  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log(a * a + b * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the logarithm of the magnitude of the complex number, rather than the logarithm of the complex number itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log(a + b * 1j)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the logarithm of the complex number in a different way, using the `1j` imaginary unit.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log(a * a - b * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the logarithm of the magnitude of the complex number, but with a different sign than the original code.

DONE.
