  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` and `bind` are different methods in JavaScript, and using `call` instead of `bind` would change the way the function is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` and `bind` are different methods in JavaScript, and using `apply` instead of `bind` would change the way the function is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` is used to bind the `this` context of a function, and passing `null` as the first argument would change the `this` context of the function.

DONE.
