  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Math.pow(2, zoom+1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using `Math.pow(2, zoom-1)`, which would return the incorrect value for the tile's x-coordinate.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Math.pow(2, zoom+2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using `Math.pow(2, zoom-2)`, which would return the incorrect value for the tile's x-coordinate.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Math.pow(2, zoom+3);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using `Math.pow(2, zoom-3)`, which would return the incorrect value for the tile's x-coordinate.

DONE.
