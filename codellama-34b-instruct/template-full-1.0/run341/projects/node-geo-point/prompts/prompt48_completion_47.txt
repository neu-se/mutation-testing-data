  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 = deg2rad(point2.latitude) + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.PI` constant would add an additional 180 degrees to the latitude value, causing the calculated bearing to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 = deg2rad(point2.latitude) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deg2rad` function would be multiplied by 2, causing the latitude value to be twice as large, which would also lead to an incorrect bearing calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 = deg2rad(point2.latitude) + Number.MAX_VALUE
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Number.MAX_VALUE` constant would be added to the latitude value, causing the calculated bearing to be extremely large, which would also lead to an incorrect bearing calculation.

DONE.
