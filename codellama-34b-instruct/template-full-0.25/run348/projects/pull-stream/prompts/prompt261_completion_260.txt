  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with the `err` argument, which is not what the original code does. The original code calls `cb` with `err` as the first argument, but only if `err` is not `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, err)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with `null` as the first argument, which is not what the original code does. The original code calls `cb` with `err` as the first argument, but only if `err` is not `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with `err` as the first argument and `null` as the second argument, which is not what the original code does. The original code calls `cb`
