  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be using the longitude value instead of the latitude value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.latitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be adding 1 to the latitude value, which would change the bearing calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.latitude * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be doubling the latitude value, which would change the bearing calculation.

DONE.
