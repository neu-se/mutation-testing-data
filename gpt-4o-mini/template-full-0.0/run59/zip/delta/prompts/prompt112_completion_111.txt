Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
target.push(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push a `null` value into the `passed` or `failed` arrays instead of the actual operation, potentially leading to unexpected results when processing the arrays later.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
target.push(op.insert);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push only the `insert` property of the operation instead of the entire operation object, which could lead to loss of information about the operation type and other properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
target.push({ ...op, retain: 0 });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the `retain` property of the operation to `0`, which could change the intended logic of how operations are processed and affect the outcome of subsequent operations.

DONE.
