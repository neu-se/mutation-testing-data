  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `gettype` function to always return "internal" for links on the same domain, regardless of the subdomain or path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `gettype` function to return "sublevel" for links that are on a subdomain of the current domain, but not for links that are on the same domain but have a different path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.endsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `gettype` function to return "uplevel" for links that are on a higher-level domain than the current domain, but not for links that are on the same domain but have a different path.

DONE.
