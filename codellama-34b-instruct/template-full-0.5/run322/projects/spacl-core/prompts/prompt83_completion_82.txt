  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, ctx.parent
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the parent context to the `matches` method instead of the current context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, ctx.root
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the root context to the `matches` method instead of the current context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, ctx.clone()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a cloned context to the `matches` method instead of the current context.

DONE.
