 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { throw new Error('Buggy defer'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because a thrown error would prevent the promise from being resolved or rejected properly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not return a deferred object, and the promise would not be able to be resolved or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a different instance of deferred object, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the original deferred object is used elsewhere in the code.

DONE.
