Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the operation from simply passing `op` to modifying it by adding 1, which could lead to unexpected results when `op` is expected to be used as-is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it alters the value of `op` by multiplying it by 2, which could cause the function to behave incorrectly if `op` is not intended to be scaled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing `op` with `null` would cause the dispatch function to receive a null value, potentially leading to runtime errors or unexpected behavior when trying to access properties or methods on `null`.

DONE.
