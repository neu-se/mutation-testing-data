  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.slice(1)
```
This will remove the first element of the `nodeArgs` array, which is the callback function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.concat(deferred.makeNodeResolver())
```
This will concatenate the `nodeArgs` array with the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function, which will create a new array with the same elements as `nodeArgs` followed by the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.map(function(arg) { return arg; })
```
This will create a new array with the same elements as `nodeArgs`, but with each element wrapped in a function that returns the original element.

DONE.
