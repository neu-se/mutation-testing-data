  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is called instead of `deferred.resolve`, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` is called instead of `deferred.resolve`, which would cause the promise to be notified instead of resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var timeoutId = setTimeout(deferred.notify, ms);
```
This would result in different behavior because a timeout is set to notify the deferred instead of resolving it.

DONE.
