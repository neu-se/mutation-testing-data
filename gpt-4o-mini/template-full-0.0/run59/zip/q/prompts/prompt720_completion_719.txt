Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of creating a deferred object that can resolve or reject, it immediately returns a rejected promise, which would cause the `Q.all` function to fail without waiting for the promises to settle.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Promise((resolve, reject) => {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new Promise that neither resolves nor rejects, effectively causing the `Q.all` function to hang indefinitely, as it would never complete the promise chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred = { resolve: function() {}, reject: function() {} }
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a `deferred` object with empty `resolve` and `reject` methods, meaning that even if the promises settle, the `Q.all` function would not be able to resolve or reject the overall promise, leading to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
