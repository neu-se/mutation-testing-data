  Sure, I can help you with that! Here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER in the code with buggy code fragments that have different behavior than the original code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function would throw an error when trying to access the `id` property on `undefined`, rather than returning the country with the specified `id`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'unknown country'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function would return a country with the name `'unknown country'` instead of the country with the specified `id`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1234567890
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function would return a country with the ID `1234567890` instead of the country with the specified `id`.

DONE.
