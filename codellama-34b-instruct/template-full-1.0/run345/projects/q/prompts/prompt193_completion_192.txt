  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
;
```
This would result in different behavior because this is a syntax error, and it would cause the code to fail to parse.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
+
```
This would result in different behavior because this is a unary plus operator, and it would coerce the string to a number before evaluating it as a boolean.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
++
```
This would result in different behavior because this is a prefix increment operator, and it would increment the numeric value stored in the variable before evaluating it as a boolean.

DONE.
