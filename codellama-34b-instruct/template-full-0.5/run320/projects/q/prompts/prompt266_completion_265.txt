  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the boolean value of `resolvedPromise`, causing the `if` statement to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would add 1 to the value of `resolvedPromise`, causing the `if` statement to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method would return a string representation of the `resolvedPromise` object, causing the `if` statement to behave differently.

DONE.
