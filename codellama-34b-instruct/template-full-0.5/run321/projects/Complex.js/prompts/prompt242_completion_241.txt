  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would swap the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, which would cause the calculation of the exponential function to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, which would cause the calculation of the exponential function to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, which would cause the calculation of the exponential function to be incorrect.

DONE.
