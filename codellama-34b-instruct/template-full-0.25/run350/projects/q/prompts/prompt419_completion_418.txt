  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.inspect` is a function, and `this.inspect.then` is undefined, so the `then` method would not be called on the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.inspect` is a function, and `this.inspect.resolve` is undefined, so the `resolve` method would not be called on the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.inspect` is a function, and `this.inspect.reject` is undefined, so the `reject` method would not be called on the promise.

DONE.
