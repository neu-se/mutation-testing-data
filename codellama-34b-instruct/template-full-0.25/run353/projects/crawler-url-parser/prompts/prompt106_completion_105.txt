  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set(currentUrl.url, currentUrl);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `urlMap` to be overwritten with a new value on each iteration of the loop, rather than adding new entries to the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set(currentUrl.url, currentUrl.url);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `urlMap` to be overwritten with a new value on each iteration of the loop, rather than adding new entries to the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set(currentUrl.url, currentUrl.url + currentUrl.baseurl);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `urlMap` to be overwritten with a new value on each iteration of the loop, rather than adding new entries to the map.

DONE.
