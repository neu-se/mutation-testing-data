  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments.slice(1)` would return an array of the arguments passed to the function, excluding the first argument, whereas `arguments` would return an array of all the arguments passed to the function.

DONE.
