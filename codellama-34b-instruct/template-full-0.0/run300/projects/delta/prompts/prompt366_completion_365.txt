  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength` returns the length of the next operation, while `peekType` returns the type of the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the type of the next operation in the other iterator, rather than the current iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `peekType` method, which returns the type of the next operation, rather than just returning the type.

DONE.
