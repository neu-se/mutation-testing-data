  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` function to always return `a` instead of `b`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` function to return `undefined` instead of `b`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` function to return `undefined` instead of `b`, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
