  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isStopIteration` function would always return `true`, even if the `exception` is not an instance of `StopIteration`, which could cause the code to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isStopIteration` function would always return `false`, even if the `exception` is an instance of `StopIteration`, which could cause the code to produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isStopIteration` function would always return `undefined`, even if the `exception` is an instance of `StopIteration`, which could cause the code to produce incorrect results.

DONE.
