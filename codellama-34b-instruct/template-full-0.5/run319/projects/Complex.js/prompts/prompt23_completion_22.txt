  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > b
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison would be reversed, meaning that the code would enter the `if` block when `a` is less than `b`, rather than when `a` is greater than `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a == b
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison would be for equality rather than inequality, meaning that the code would enter the `if` block when `a` is equal to `b`, rather than when `a` is greater than `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison would be for the product of `a` and `b`, rather than their difference. This would cause the code to enter the `if` block when the product of `a` and `b` is greater than zero, rather than when `a` is greater than `b`.

DONE.
