  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.invert(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` method expects a non-null argument, and passing `null` would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.invert(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` method expects a non-null argument, and passing `undefined` would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.invert(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` method expects a non-zero argument, and passing `0` would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

DONE.
