  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coerce
```
This would result in different behavior because the `coerce` function is not defined in the original code, and therefore would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function is not defined in the original code, and therefore would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function is not defined in the original code, and therefore would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
