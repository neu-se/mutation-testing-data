  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
replacer || null
```
This would result in different behavior because if the `replacer` argument is falsy, the original code would call `JSON.stringify` with `replacer` set to `null`, which would result in the function returning `null` if `obj` is not serializable. However, if we replace `replacer` with `replacer || null`, the function would return `null` regardless of whether `obj` is serializable or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
replacer && null
```
This would result in different behavior because if the `replacer` argument is truthy, the original code would call `JSON.stringify` with `replacer` set to `null`, which would result in the function returning `null` if `obj` is not serializable. However, if we replace `replacer` with `replacer && null`, the function would return `null` regardless of whether `obj` is serializable or not.
