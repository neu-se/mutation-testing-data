  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/\//g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag would cause the regex to match all occurrences of `//` in the path, rather than just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/\//i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag would cause the regex to match `//` in a case-insensitive manner, which could lead to unexpected results if the path contains uppercase characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/\//m
```
This would result in different behavior because the `m` flag would cause the regex to match `//` at the beginning of a line, rather than just at the beginning of the path.

DONE.
