  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `while` loop to iterate one more time than it should, potentially leading to an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `while` loop to terminate one iteration earlier than it should, potentially leading to a missing iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `while` loop to iterate one more time than it should, potentially leading to an infinite loop.

DONE.
