  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isPromise(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would make the condition always evaluate to `true`, causing the `if` block to always execute, regardless of the value of `value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromise(value) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, which would cause the `if` block to execute only if the value of `value` is not a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof value !== "object" || value.constructor !== Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator checks the data type of the value, and the `constructor` property checks the constructor function of the value. If the value is not an object or the constructor function is not `Promise`, the `if` block would execute.

DONE.
