 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'$("body a")'
```
This would result in different behavior because it selects all `a` elements within the `body` tag, while the original code selects all `a` elements in the entire document.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'$("a")[0]'
```
This would result in different behavior because it selects the first `a` element in the document, while the original code iterates over all `a` elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'document.querySelectorAll("a")'
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `querySelectorAll` method to select all `a` elements, while the original code uses Cheerio's `$` function.

DONE.
