  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function () {};
```
This would result in different behavior because it would override the `Q.onerror` function with a no-op function, which would prevent any error handling from occurring.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function (error) { throw error; };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would override the `Q.onerror` function with a function that throws any error it receives, which would cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function (error) { return error; };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would override the `Q.onerror` function with a function that returns any error it receives, which would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the error.

DONE.
