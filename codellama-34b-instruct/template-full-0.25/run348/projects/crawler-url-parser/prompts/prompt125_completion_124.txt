  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.includes(pageurl)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `includes()` method checks if the first argument is a substring of the second argument, while the original code fragment checks if the two arguments are equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.indexOf(pageurl) > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `indexOf()` method checks if the first argument is a substring of the second argument, while the original code fragment checks if the two arguments are equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.match(pageurl)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match()` method checks if the first argument is a regular expression that matches the second argument, while the original code fragment checks if the two arguments are equal.

DONE.
