  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index >= count
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute if the index is greater than or equal to the count.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > count
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute if the index is greater than the count.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= count
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute if the index is less than or equal to the count.

DONE.
