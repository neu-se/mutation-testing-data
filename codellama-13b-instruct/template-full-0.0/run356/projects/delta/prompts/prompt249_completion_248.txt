  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thisOp.insert` property is not guaranteed to be a string, and the `indexOf` method is only defined for strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString` method is not guaranteed to return a string that can be used with the `indexOf` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert.toString().indexOf(newline)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString` method is not guaranteed to return a string that can be used with the `indexOf` method, and the `indexOf` method is only defined for strings.

DONE.
