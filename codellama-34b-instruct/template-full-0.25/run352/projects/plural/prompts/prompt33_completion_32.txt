  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substring
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring` is a different method than `substr`, and it has a different behavior when the end index is negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` is a different method than `substr`, and it has a different behavior when the end index is negative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'es'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not handle the case where the word ends with 'quy' correctly.

DONE.
