  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '+' : '') + tokens[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the unary plus operator would be used instead of the unary minus operator, which would cause the sign of the imaginary part to be flipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + tokens[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the unary minus operator would be used instead of the unary plus operator, which would cause the sign of the imaginary part to be flipped.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '*' : '') + tokens[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operator would be used instead of the addition operator, which would cause the imaginary part to be multiplied by the next token instead of being added to it.

DONE.
