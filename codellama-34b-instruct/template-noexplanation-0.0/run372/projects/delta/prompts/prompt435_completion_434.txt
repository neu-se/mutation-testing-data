  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length > opLength - offset
```
This change will cause the `next` method to return a different value than the original code, which could potentially cause issues with the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length < opLength - offset
```
This change will cause the `next` method to return a different value than the original code, which could potentially cause issues with the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length === opLength - offset
```
This change will cause the `next` method to return a different value than the original code, which could potentially cause issues with the test suite.

DONE.
