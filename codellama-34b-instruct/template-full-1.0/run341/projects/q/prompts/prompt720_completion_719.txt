  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is a function that creates a new deferred object, while `null` is a primitive value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is a function that creates a new deferred object, while `undefined` is a primitive value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is a function that creates a new deferred object, while `0` is a number value.

DONE.
