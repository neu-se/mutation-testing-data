  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` keyword refers to the global object in non-strict mode, while `null` would refer to the null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` keyword refers to the global object in non-strict mode, while `undefined` would refer to the undefined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` keyword refers to the global object in non-strict mode, while `{}` would refer to a new object.

DONE.
