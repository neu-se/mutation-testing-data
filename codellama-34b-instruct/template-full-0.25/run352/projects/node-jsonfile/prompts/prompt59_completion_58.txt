  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/EOL/g, EOL
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/EOL/g` would match the string "EOL" instead of the newline character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\r/g, EOL
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/\r/g` would match the carriage return character instead of the newline character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[\r\n]/g, EOL
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/[\r\n]/g` would match both the carriage return and newline characters, which is not the case with the original regular expression `/\n/g`.

DONE.
