  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the inspect function with the wrong number of arguments, potentially causing an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the prototype of the inspect function, rather than the function itself, which could break the code that relies on the function's behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect.arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the arguments object of the inspect function, rather than the function itself, which could break the code that relies on the function's behavior.

DONE.
