  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method expects a function as its argument, but `null` is being passed instead. This would cause the `deferred.reject` method to be called with `null` as its argument, which would result in a different error message than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method expects a function as its argument, but an empty function is being passed instead. This would cause the `deferred.reject` method to be called with a function as its argument, which would result in a different error message than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(deferred.resolve)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method expects a function as its
