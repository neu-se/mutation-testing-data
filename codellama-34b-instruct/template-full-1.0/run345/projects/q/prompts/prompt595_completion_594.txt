  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `args` is an array, and `args[0]` would pick the first element of the array, potentially changing the behavior of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `args` is an array, and `args.slice(1)` would return a new array with all elements except the first one, potentially changing the behavior of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object, and it would likely cause the function to fail if it was expecting an array or a non-empty object.

DONE.
