  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is evaluated to `undefined` and does not return a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a different value than `Q` and would not have the same properties or methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to a different object than `Q` and could potentially have different properties or methods.

DONE.
