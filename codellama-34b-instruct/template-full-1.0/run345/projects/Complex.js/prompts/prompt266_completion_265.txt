  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a/b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the division of `a` and `b`, whereas the original code fragment calculates the `atan2` of `b` and `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b/a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the division of `b` and `a`, whereas the original code fragment calculates the `atan2` of `b` and `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a%b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the modulo of `a` and `b`, whereas the original code fragment calculates the `atan2` of `b` and `a`.

DONE.
