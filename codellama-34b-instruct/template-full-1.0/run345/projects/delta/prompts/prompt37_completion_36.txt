  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys` returns an array of the keys of an object, while `Object.values` returns an array of the values of an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys` returns an array of the keys of an object, while `Object.entries` returns an array of the key-value pairs of an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.getOwnPropertyNames
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.getOwnPropertyNames` returns an array of all properties (including non-enumerable properties) of an object, while `Object.keys` returns an array of only the enumerable properties of an object.

DONE.
