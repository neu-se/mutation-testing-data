 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof global === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the `global` object instead of the `module` object, which may not have the same properties depending on the execution context (e.g., in a browser environment).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns `false`, regardless of the actual type of `module`. This could cause issues if the original code relies on the `Delta` object being exported in certain conditions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
module && typeof module === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an additional check for the existence of the `module` object. If the code is running in an environment where `module` is not defined, this would cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
