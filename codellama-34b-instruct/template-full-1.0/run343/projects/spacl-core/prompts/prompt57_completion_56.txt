  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/:/./g
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any string with a slash followed by any character, whereas the original code fragment only matches strings with a specific character at a specific position.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[.]/g
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any string with a dot character anywhere in the string, whereas the original code fragment only matches strings with a specific character at a specific position.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[.$]/g
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any string with a dot or $ character at the end of the string, whereas the original code fragment only matches strings with a specific character at a specific position.

DONE.
