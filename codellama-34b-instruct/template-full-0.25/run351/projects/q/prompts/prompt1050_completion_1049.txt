  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `ends.reject` would reject the promise instead of resolving it, which would cause the `get` method to fail with an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve = null
```
This would result in different behavior because `ends.resolve` would be set to `null` instead of a function, which would cause an error when trying to call the `put` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve = function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `ends.resolve` would be set to a function that does nothing, which would cause the `put` method to do nothing instead of resolving the promise.

DONE.
