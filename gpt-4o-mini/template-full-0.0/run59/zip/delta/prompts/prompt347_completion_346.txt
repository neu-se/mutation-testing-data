Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of `baseOpData` would cause the handler's `invert` method to receive an invalid argument, potentially leading to unexpected results or errors during the inversion process.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` instead of `baseOpData` may lead to different handling in the `invert` method, which could result in the omission of certain attributes or operations that should have been processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"invalidData"
```
This would result in different behavior because providing a string like `"invalidData"` instead of `baseOpData` would likely cause the handler's `invert` method to fail or behave incorrectly, as it would not be able to process a string in the expected manner.

DONE.
