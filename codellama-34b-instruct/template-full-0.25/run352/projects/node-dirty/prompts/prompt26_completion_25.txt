  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (cb) cb(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed the `err` argument to the callback, while this new code fragment passes `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (cb) cb(new Error('Callback called with error'));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed the `err` argument to the callback, while this new code fragment passes a new `Error` object with a different message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (cb) cb(new Error('Callback called with error'), null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed the `err` argument to the callback, while this new code fragment passes a new `Error` object with a different message and a `null` value for the `data` argument.

DONE.
