  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'longitude'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromObject` method would use the `longitude` property instead of the `latitude` property to create the `GeoPoint` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'latitude' + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromObject` method would use the `latitude` property plus one instead of the `latitude` property to create the `GeoPoint` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'longitude' + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromObject` method would use the `longitude` property plus one instead of the `longitude` property to create the `GeoPoint` object.

DONE.
