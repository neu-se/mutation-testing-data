  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise2"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string "promise2" is not the same as the original string "promise", which could cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise" + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the string "promise" is being concatenated with the number 1, which could cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise" * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the string "promise" is being multiplied by the number 2, which could cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

DONE.
