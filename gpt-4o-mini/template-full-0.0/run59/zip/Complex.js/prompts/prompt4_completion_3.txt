Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the input `x`, which would change the output of the `cosh` function, leading to incorrect results for small values of `x`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it doubles the input `x`, which would significantly alter the output of the `cosh` function, especially for larger values of `x`, resulting in incorrect calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the input `x` with the sine of `x`, which is a completely different mathematical operation and would yield incorrect results for the `cosh` function.

DONE.
