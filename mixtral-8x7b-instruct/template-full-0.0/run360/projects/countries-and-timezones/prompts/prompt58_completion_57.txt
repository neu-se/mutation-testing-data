 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => buildCountry(data, id)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new function each time, which may not take advantage of memoization.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
memoizeCountry(buildCountry(data, 'wrongId'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes a hardcoded 'wrongId' instead of the actual 'id', potentially causing incorrect country initialization.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
memoizeCountry(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it always passes null to memoizeCountry, which might cause issues if the memoizeCountry function relies on its argument.

DONE.
