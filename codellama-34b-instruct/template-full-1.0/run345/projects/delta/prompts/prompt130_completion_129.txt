  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end - index` expression would always be negative, causing the `while` loop to never be entered.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `while` loop would never end, as the `index` variable would always be less than `end`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the `while` loop would never end, as the `index` variable would always be less than `Infinity`.

DONE.
