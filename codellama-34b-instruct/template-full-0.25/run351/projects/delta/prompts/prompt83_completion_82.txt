  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes !== lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because `isEqual` checks for deep equality, while `!==` checks for reference inequality. This means that if `newOp.attributes` and `lastOp.attributes` have the same keys and values, but are stored in different objects, `isEqual` would return `true`, while `!==` would return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(newOp.attributes).length !== Object.keys(lastOp.attributes).length
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys` returns an array of the keys in an object, and `length` returns the length of an array. This means that if `newOp.attributes` and `lastOp.attributes` have the same keys, but different values, `isEqual` would return `true`, while `Object.keys(newOp.attributes).length !== Object.keys(lastOp.attributes).length` would return `false`.
