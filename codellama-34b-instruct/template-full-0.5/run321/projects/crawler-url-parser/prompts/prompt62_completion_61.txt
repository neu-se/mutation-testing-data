  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the path component of the URL, whereas the original code fragment returns the entire URL object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the host component of the URL, whereas the original code fragment returns the entire URL object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the protocol component of the URL, whereas the original code fragment returns the entire URL object.

DONE.
