  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spaces + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spaces` variable is being used as an integer, and the `+ 1` operation would cause the `stringify` function to add an extra space to the output string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spaces - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spaces` variable is being used as an integer, and the `- 1` operation would cause the `stringify` function to remove an extra space from the output string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spaces * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spaces` variable is being used as an integer, and the `* 2` operation would cause the `stringify` function to add an extra space to the output string, and then remove it again, resulting in no change to the output.

DONE.
