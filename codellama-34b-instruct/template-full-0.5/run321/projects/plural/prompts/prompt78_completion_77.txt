  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('goose', 'goose')
```
This would result in different behavior because the rule for 'goose' would be added twice, which would cause the pluralization of 'goose' to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('goose', 'geese')
```
This would result in different behavior because the rule for 'goose' would be overwritten, which would cause the pluralization of 'goose' to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('goose', function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the rule for 'goose' would be overwritten with a new rule that always appends 's' to the word, which would cause the pluralization of 'goose' to be incorrect.

DONE.
