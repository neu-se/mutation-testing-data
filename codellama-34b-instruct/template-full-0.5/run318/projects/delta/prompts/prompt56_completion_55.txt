  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, so the resulting `Delta` object would have its operations in reverse order compared to the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method returns a shallow copy of the array, so the resulting `Delta` object would have a different reference to the operations array compared to the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat()` method returns a new array that is the result of concatenating the given arrays, so the resulting `Delta` object would have a different reference to the operations array compared to the original code.

DONE.
