  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `object` is a valid JavaScript object, while `null` is a primitive value that does not have any properties or methods. If a method is called on `null`, it will throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `object` is a valid JavaScript object, while `undefined` is a primitive value that does not have any properties or methods. If a method is called on `undefined`, it will throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `object` is a valid JavaScript object, while `{}` is an empty object that does not have any properties or methods. If a method is called on `{}`, it will throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
