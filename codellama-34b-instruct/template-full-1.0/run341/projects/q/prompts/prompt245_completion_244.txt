  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```function (result) {
    if (result.length) {
        deferred.reject(new Error("Polyfill failed to load"));
    } else {
        deferred.resolve(result);
    }
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property is not always a reliable indication of whether a promise has been resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```function (error, result) {
    if (error) {
        deferred.reject(new Error("Polyfill failed to load"));
    } else {
        deferred.resolve(result);
    }
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` argument is not always an error object, and the `result` argument may not be the expected data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```function (key, data) {
    if (key === "resolve") {
        deferred.resolve(data
