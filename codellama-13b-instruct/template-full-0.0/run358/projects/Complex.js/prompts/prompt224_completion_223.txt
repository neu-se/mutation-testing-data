  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition `a >= 0` is not equivalent to `a > 0` for negative values of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a >= 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition `a >= 0` is not equivalent to `a >= 1` for values of `a` less than 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition `a >= 0` is not equivalent to `a < 0` for positive values of `a`.

DONE.
