Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_filter` will return only the elements of the array that pass a given test (i.e., are truthy), potentially omitting some promises that should be processed, leading to incomplete results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_map(promises, function(p) { return p; })
```
This would result in different behavior because this code effectively returns the original array without any transformation, which may not handle promises correctly and could lead to unexpected results when resolving them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_map(promises, function(p) { return Q.reject(new Error("Promise rejected")); })
```
This would result in different behavior because this code will transform all promises into rejected promises, causing the `allResolved` function to always return a rejected promise, regardless of the original promises' states.

DONE.
