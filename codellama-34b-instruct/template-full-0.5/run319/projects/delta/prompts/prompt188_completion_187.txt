  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `embedType` variable would be incremented, which could cause the composed delta to have a different structure or content than the original delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `embedType` variable would be decremented, which could cause the composed delta to have a different structure or content than the original delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `embedType` variable would be doubled, which could cause the composed delta to have a different structure or content than the original delta.

DONE.
