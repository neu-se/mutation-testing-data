 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
at > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for the index being greater than -1 instead of equal to -1, causing the unhandled rejection to never be untracked even when it is handled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unhandledRejections.indexOf(promise) !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly accesses the `unhandledRejections` array instead of using the `at` variable, potentially causing unexpected behavior if the array has been modified since the index was stored in `at`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof at !== "number"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the type of `at` instead of its value, causing the unhandled rejection to never be untracked even when it is handled.

DONE.
