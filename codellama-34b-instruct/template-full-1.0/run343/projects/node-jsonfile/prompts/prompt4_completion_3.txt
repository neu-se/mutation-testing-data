  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
files
```
This would result in different behavior because the `readFile` function takes a `file` argument, not `files`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
contents
```
This would result in different behavior because the `readFile` function takes a `options` argument, not `contents`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `readFile` function takes a `options` argument, not `null`.

DONE.
