  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezonesMap === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `timezonesMap` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if it is strictly equal to `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezonesMap.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `timezonesMap` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if its length is equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!timezonesMap.hasOwnProperty('current')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `timezonesMap` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if it has a property called `current`.

DONE.
