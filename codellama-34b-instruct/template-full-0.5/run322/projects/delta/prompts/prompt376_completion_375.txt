  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'insert' && otherIter.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider `insert` operations with a length greater than 0, which would exclude any `insert` operations with a length of 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider any operation that is not an `insert` operation, which would include `delete` and `retain` operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider `retain` operations, which would exclude any `insert` or `delete` operations.

DONE.
