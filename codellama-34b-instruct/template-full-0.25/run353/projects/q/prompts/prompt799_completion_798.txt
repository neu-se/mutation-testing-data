  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` function would receive `null` as its first argument, which would cause it to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` function would receive `undefined` as its first argument, which would cause it to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` function would receive the string "foo" as its first argument, which would cause it to throw an error.

DONE.
