  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.rest
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue iterating over the rest of the ops, even if the current op has already been processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.rest
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue iterating over the rest of the ops in the other delta, even if the current op has already been processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to end immediately, without processing any more ops.

DONE.
