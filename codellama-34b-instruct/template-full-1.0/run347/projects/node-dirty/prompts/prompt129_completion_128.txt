  Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork(? undefined : key);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause `cork` to be called with a different argument than `key`, which would lead to different behavior in the code that follows.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork(key, "");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause `cork` to be called with two arguments instead of one, which would lead to different behavior in the code that follows.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork(key, false);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause `cork` to be called with a different argument than the original code, which would lead to different behavior in the code that follows.

DONE.
