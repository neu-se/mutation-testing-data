  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'abs' in a && 'arg' in b
```
This would result in different behavior because the check is now done on the `b` object instead of the `a` object, which could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if the `abs` and `arg` properties exist on the `a` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'abs' in b && 'arg' in a
```
This would result in different behavior because the check is now done on the `b` object instead of the `a` object, which could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if the `abs` and `arg` properties exist on the `a` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'abs' in a || 'arg' in b
```
This would result in different behavior because the check is now done using the `||` operator instead of the `&&` operator, which could cause the `
