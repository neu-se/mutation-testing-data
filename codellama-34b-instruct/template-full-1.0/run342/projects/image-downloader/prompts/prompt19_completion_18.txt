  Sure, I can help you with that!

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!path.extname(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the destination path has an extension, whereas the original code fragment checks if the path is absolute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename(options.dest) === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the destination path has a basename, whereas the original code fragment checks if the path is absolute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(options.dest) === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the destination path has a parent directory, whereas the original code fragment checks if the path is absolute.

DONE.
