  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ms, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `timeout` function to always return a rejected promise, regardless of whether the given promise is fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, ms
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `timeout` function to always return a fulfilled promise, regardless of whether the given promise is fulfilled or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error, ms
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `timeout` function to always return a rejected promise with the error message "Timed out after 1000 ms", regardless of whether the given promise is fulfilled or rejected.

DONE.
