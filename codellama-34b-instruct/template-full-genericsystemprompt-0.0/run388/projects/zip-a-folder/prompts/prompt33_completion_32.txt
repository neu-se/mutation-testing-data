  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a function that resolves the promise, whereas `reject` is a function that rejects the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.on('error', () => {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has a callback function that logs the error, whereas this new code fragment has an empty callback function that does nothing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.on('error', (err) => { throw err; });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has a callback function that logs the error, whereas this new code fragment has a callback function that throws the error.

DONE.
