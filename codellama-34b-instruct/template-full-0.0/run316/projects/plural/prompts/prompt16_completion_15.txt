  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1, w.length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method would return a different substring, starting from the second character instead of the first.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 2, w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method would return a different substring, starting from the second-to-last character instead of the last.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1, w.length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method would return a different substring, starting from the last character instead of the second-to-last.

DONE.
