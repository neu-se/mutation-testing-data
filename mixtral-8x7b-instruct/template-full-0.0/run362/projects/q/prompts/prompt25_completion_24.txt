 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
setTimeout(task, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `setTimeout` instead of the original `runSingle`, which may cause the task to be executed asynchronously in a future event loop instead of immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
task(); task();
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the task twice, which is not the same as the original `runSingle` which calls the task once.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
eval(task);
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `eval` to execute the task, which can have different scoping and execution context than the original `runSingle`.

DONE.
