  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello world"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"hello world"` is a string and does not have the same type or behavior as the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because `Infinity` is a constant and does not have the same type or behavior as the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 / 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `2 / 0` is division by zero, which returns NaN (not a number) and does not have the same type or behavior as the original code fragment.

DONE.
