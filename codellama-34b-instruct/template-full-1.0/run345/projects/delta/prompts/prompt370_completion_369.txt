  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.insert` would insert a new line at the end of the file, whereas `delta.retain` would retain the existing line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.delete` would delete the last line of the file, whereas `delta.retain` would retain the existing line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(Op.length(thisIter.next()))
```
This would result in different behavior because `Op.length(thisIter.next())` would return the length of the next operation in the iterator, whereas `delta.retain` would retain the existing line.

DONE.
