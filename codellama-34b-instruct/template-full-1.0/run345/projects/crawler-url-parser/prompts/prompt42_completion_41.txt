  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.format(parsedBaseUrl) + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `foo` string would be appended to the base URL, which could potentially cause the `parse` function to fail or produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.format(parsedBaseUrl) + 'bar'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bar` string would be appended to the base URL, which could potentially cause the `parse` function to fail or produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.format(parsedBaseUrl) + 'baz'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baz` string would be appended to the base URL, which could potentially cause the `parse` function to fail or produce incorrect results.

DONE.
