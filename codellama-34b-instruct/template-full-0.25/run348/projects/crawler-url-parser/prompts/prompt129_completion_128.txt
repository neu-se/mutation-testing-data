  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(pageurl, baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `baseUrlStr` parameter to the `parse` function, which would cause the function to use a different base URL for parsing the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(pageurl, baseUrlStr, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `true` parameter to the `parse` function, which would cause the function to use a different algorithm for parsing the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(pageurl, baseUrlStr, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `false` parameter to the `parse` function, which would cause the function to use a different algorithm for parsing the URL.

DONE.
