  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
11, places || 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the base of the logarithm would be 11 instead of 10, which would cause the output to be different for the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10, places || 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `places` parameter would be set to 1 instead of 0, which would cause the output to be different for the same input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10, places + 1 || 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `places` parameter would be incremented by 1 before being used, which would cause the output to be different for the same input.

DONE.
