  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newVerbs
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new `verbs` object instead of modifying the existing one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.assign({}, this.verbs)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a shallow copy of the `verbs` object instead of modifying the existing one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(this.verbs))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a deep copy of the `verbs` object instead of modifying the existing one.

DONE.
