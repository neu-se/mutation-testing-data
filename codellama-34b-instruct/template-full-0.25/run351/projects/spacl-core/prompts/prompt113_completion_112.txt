  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb in this.verbs
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, even if the verb is not in the `verbs` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.verbs[verb]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the value of the `verb` property in the `verbs` object, regardless of whether the verb is in the object or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.verbs.hasOwnProperty(verb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if the `verbs` object has a property with the same name as the `verb` variable, regardless of whether the property is an own property or not.

DONE.
