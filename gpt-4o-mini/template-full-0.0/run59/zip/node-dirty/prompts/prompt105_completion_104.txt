Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key + '1'
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends the string '1' to the key, resulting in a different key being used to store the value in `_data`, which could lead to data loss or incorrect data retrieval.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the value instead of the key to store the data in `_data`, which would cause the data structure to be populated incorrectly, potentially overwriting existing keys with values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to store the value `undefined` as the key in `_data`, which is not a valid key and would lead to unexpected behavior or errors when trying to access or manipulate the data.

DONE.
