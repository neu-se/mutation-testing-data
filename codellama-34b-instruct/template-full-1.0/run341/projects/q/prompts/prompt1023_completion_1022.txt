  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Q(object).nodeify
```
This would result in different behavior because `new` is not a valid operator in this context, and will cause a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).notNodeify
```
This would result in different behavior because `notNodeify` is not a method of the `Q` object, and will cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).nodeify(function() { return; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeify` method expects a callback function as its second argument, but `function() { return; }` will cause the callback to be executed immediately and return `undefined`, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
