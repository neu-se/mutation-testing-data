  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(reject(reason));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `reject` function with the `reason` argument, which would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas the original code would call the `become` function with the `reject` function as an argument, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the result of calling the `reject` function.

DONE.
