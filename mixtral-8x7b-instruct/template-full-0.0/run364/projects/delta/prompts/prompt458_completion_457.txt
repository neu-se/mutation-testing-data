 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return an infinite length for the `rest()` method, even if there are no more operations left in the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the first remaining operation in the `rest()` method, even if there are more operations left in the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return all the remaining operations in the `rest()` method, regardless of the current index and offset. This could lead to unexpected behavior when iterating over the operations.

DONE.
