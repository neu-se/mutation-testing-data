Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because using `null` instead of `void 0` would cause the promise to resolve with `null` instead of `undefined`, potentially leading to unexpected results in subsequent promise chains that expect an `undefined` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because using `1` instead of `void 0` would cause the promise to resolve with the value `1`, which could lead to logic errors in any subsequent operations that assume the resolved value is `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because using `this` instead of `void 0` would cause the promise to resolve with the current context (the promise itself), which could lead to infinite loops or unexpected behavior in promise handling if the context is not managed correctly.

DONE.
