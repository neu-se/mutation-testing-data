  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method would be called with a different argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method would be called with a different argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * z['re'] - this['im'] * z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication and subtraction operations would be performed in a different order.

DONE.
