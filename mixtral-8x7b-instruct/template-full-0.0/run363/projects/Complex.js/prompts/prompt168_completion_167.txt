 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true when the divisor is a zero complex number, even if the dividend is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
z['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if the real part of the divisor is zero, not the entire divisor.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
z.isZero()
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `isZero` method with dot notation instead of bracket notation. This could cause issues if the `isZero` method is not defined as a property of the `z` object.

DONE.
