  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacteria'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a singular noun, while the replacement code fragment is a plural noun.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacteria' + 'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a singular noun, while the replacement code fragment is a plural noun with an extra 'a' at the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacterium' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a singular noun, while the replacement code fragment is a plural noun with an extra 's' at the end.

DONE.
