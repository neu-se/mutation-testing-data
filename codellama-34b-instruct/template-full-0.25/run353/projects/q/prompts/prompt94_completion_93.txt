  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the index is greater than the length of the array, rather than checking if the index is a valid index in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the index is less than the length of the array, rather than checking if the index is a valid index in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index === this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the index is equal to the length of the array, rather than checking if the index is a valid index in the array.

DONE.
