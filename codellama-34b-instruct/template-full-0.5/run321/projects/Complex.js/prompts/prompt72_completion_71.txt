  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, so the code inside the `if` block would not be executed even if `tokens` is `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `tokens` array is empty, whereas the original code checks if `tokens` is `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[0] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the first element of the `tokens` array is `undefined`, whereas the original code checks if `tokens` is `null`.

DONE.
