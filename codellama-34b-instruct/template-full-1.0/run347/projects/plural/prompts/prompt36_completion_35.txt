  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, w.length - 1) + 'es'
```
This would result in different behavior because the word would be pluralized incorrectly, resulting in the incorrect output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, w.length - 5) + 'ies'
```
This would result in different behavior because the word would be pluralized incorrectly, resulting in the incorrect output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, w.length - 3) + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the word would be pluralized incorrectly, resulting in the incorrect output.

DONE.
