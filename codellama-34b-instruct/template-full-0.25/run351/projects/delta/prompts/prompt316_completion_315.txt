  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the operation would be increased by 1, which could cause the code to skip over a necessary operation or perform an unnecessary operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the operation would be decreased by 1, which could cause the code to perform an unnecessary operation or skip over a necessary operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the operation would be doubled, which could cause the code to perform twice as many operations as necessary or skip over necessary operations.

DONE.
