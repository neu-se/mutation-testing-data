  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer()` function is called without assigning the created promise to a variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer().resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the created promise would be resolved immediately with the `value` argument, even though it was not intended to be resolved at that point in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer().reject(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because the created promise would be rejected immediately with the `reason` argument, even though it was not intended to be rejected at that point in the code.

DONE.
