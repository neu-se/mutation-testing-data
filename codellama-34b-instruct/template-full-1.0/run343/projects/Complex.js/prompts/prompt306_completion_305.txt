  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the same value as the original code fragment, which is not the intention of the mutation testing process.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increase the imaginary part of the complex number by 1, which would change the output of the `tan` function and cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, which would change the output of the `tan` function and cause the test to fail.

DONE.
