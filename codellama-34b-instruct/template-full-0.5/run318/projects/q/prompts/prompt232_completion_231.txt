  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
operands[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because `operands[2]` would refer to the third argument passed to the `when` method, whereas `operands[1]` refers to the second argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
operands[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `operands[0]` would refer to the first argument passed to the `when` method, whereas `operands[1]` refers to the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
operands[1] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `operands[1] + 1` would refer to the second argument plus one, whereas `operands[1]` refers to the second argument itself.

DONE.
