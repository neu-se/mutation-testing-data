  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.delete !== length;
```
This would result in different behavior because the check for the `delete` property would be negated, causing the code to always return true, even if the `delete` property does not exist.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.delete !== 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the check for the `delete` property would always return true, whether the `delete` property exists or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp?.delete === length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` property would be checked only if it exists, and the code would return a `ReferenceError` if it does not exist.

Done.
