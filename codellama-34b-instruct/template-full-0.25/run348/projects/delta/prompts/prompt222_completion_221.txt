  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `diff` function would be comparing the second string in the `strings` array instead of the first one, which could lead to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0].length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `diff` function would be comparing the length of the first string in the `strings` array instead of the strings themselves, which could lead to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0].toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `diff` function would be comparing the lowercase version of the first string in the `strings` array instead of the original string, which could lead to incorrect results.

DONE.
