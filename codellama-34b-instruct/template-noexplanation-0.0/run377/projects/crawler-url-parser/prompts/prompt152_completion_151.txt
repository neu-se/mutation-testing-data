  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff <= 0
```
This change will cause the `gettype` function to return "internal" for links that have the same number of path parts as the current page, rather than only returning "internal" for links that have fewer path parts.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff >= 0
```
This change will cause the `gettype` function to return "internal" for links that have the same number of path parts as the current page, rather than only returning "internal" for links that have more path parts.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff != 0
```
This change will cause the `gettype` function to return "internal" for links that have the same number of path parts as the current page, rather than only returning "internal" for links that have a different number of path parts.

DONE.
