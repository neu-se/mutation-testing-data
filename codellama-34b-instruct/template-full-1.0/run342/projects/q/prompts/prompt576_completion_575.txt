  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuex
```
This would result in different behavior because "continuex" is not a valid JavaScript keyword, so using it would result in a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
breakx
```
This would result in different behavior because "breakx" is not a valid JavaScript keyword, so using it would result in a syntax error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
yield
```
This would result in different behavior because using "yield" in a generator function would cause the function to pause execution and return a pending promise, which is not the behavior we want in this case.

DONE.
