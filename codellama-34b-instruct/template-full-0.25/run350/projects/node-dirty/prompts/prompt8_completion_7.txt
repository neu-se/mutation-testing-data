  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `val` would return the value of the `val` variable, while the new code fragment `null` would return `null` regardless of the value of the `val` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `val` would return the value of the `val` variable, while the new code fragment `undefined` would return `undefined` regardless of the value of the `val` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `val` would return the value of the `val` variable, while the new code fragment `0` would return `0` regardless of the value of the `val` variable.

DONE.
