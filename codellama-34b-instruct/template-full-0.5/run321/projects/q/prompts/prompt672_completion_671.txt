  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` would reject the promise, whereas `Q` would resolve it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve("foo")
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve("foo")` would resolve the promise with the value "foo", whereas `Q` would resolve it with the value returned by `object.dispatch("apply", [void 0, args])`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fbind(object, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fbind(object, args)` would bind the function to `object` with the given `args`, whereas `Q` would resolve the promise with the value returned by `object.dispatch("apply", [void 0, args])`.

DONE.
