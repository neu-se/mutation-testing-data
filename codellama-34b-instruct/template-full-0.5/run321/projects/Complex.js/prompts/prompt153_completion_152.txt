  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is not defined on the `Complex` object, so the code would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite'] = function() { return false; };
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is now defined on the `Complex` object, but it always returns `false`, so the code would not behave as expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite'] = function() { return true; };
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is now defined on the `Complex` object, but it always returns `true`, so the code would not behave as expected.

DONE.
