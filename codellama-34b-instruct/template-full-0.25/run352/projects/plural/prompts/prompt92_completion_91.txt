Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chilli'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string literal, while the new code fragment is a variable reference.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chillies'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string literal, while the new code fragment is a variable reference.
