 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
setTimeout
```
This would result in different behavior because it would start a new timeout instead of clearing the existing one, causing the promise to eventually reject even if the original timeout would have expired before that.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
clearInterval
```
This would result in different behavior because it is used to clear intervals, not timeouts. This would lead to the timeout not being cleared and the promise eventually rejecting.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately reject the promise with no timeout, even if the original timeout would have allowed the promise to resolve.

DONE.
