  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^\uFEFF/, '')
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses a different regular expression to match the BOM character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^\uFEFF/g, '')
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the `g` flag to replace all occurrences of the BOM character, not just the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^\uFEFF/g, ' ')
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it replaces the BOM character with a space character, rather than removing it.

DONE.
