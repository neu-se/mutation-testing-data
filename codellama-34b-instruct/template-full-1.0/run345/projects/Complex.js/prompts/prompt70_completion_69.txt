  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function is not a method of the `RegExp` object, and would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b.substring
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring` method expects at least one argument, and would throw an error if none are provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method expects at least one argument, and would throw an error if none are provided.

DONE.
