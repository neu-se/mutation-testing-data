 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
180/Math.PI*θ
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly multiplies θ with a constant, instead of using the `rad2deg` function which might have additional logic or conversions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan2(y, x) * 180 / Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the order of operations and uses different mathematical constants, which might lead to different results due to floating-point precision errors or differences in the order of operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.asin(y / Math.sqrt(Math.pow(x, 2) + Math.pow(y, 2))) * 180 / Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `asin` function instead of `atan2`, which might lead to incorrect results for certain input values
