Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always attempt to peek at the first operation in the `other` Delta as if it had a retain value of 0, which could lead to incorrect handling of subsequent operations that rely on the actual retain value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always assume that the first operation in the `other` Delta has a retain value of 1, potentially causing the algorithm to skip or misinterpret the first operation if it has a different retain value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat the first operation in the `other` Delta as if it does not exist, leading to incorrect processing of the operations and potentially resulting in lost data during the composition.

DONE.
