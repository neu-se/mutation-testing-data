  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get("head")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `get` method to retrieve the `tail` property from the `ends.promise` object, while this modified code fragment uses the `get` method to retrieve the `head` property from the `ends.promise` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get("tail").get("head")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `get` method to retrieve the `tail` property from the `ends.promise` object, while this modified code fragment uses the `get` method to retrieve the `head` property from the `tail` property of the `ends.promise` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get("tail").get("tail")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `get` method
