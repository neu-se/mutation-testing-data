This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes and returns the last element of the array, whereas `shift` removes and returns the first element. This would cause the `trackRejection` function to remove a different promise from the `unhandledRejections` array, which could lead to incorrect tracking of unhandled rejections.

This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes and returns the last element of the array, whereas `shift` removes and returns the first element. This would cause the `trackRejection` function to remove a different reason from the `unhandledReasons` array, which could lead to incorrect tracking of unhandled rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(promise)
```
This would result in
