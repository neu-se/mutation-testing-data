  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
captureLine + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the line number by 1, potentially causing the mutation testing to miss the original line of code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
captureLine - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the line number by 1, potentially causing the mutation testing to miss the original line of code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
captureLine * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the line number, potentially causing the mutation testing to miss the original line of code.

DONE.
