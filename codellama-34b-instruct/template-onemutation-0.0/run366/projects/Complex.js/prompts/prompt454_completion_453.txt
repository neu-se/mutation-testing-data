  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite()` checks if a value is a finite number, while `isNaN()` checks if a value is not a number. In this case, the `isFinite()` function would return `true` for `NaN`, which is not the desired behavior.

DONE.
