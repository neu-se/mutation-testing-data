  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.concat('s')
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.concat('s')` would return a new string with "s" added, while `w.replace` would replace the matched characters with "ves" in "f/fe" ending words, resulting in a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substr(0, w.length - 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.substr(0, w.length - 2)` would return a new string with the last two characters removed, while `w.replace` would replace the matched characters with "ves" in "f/fe" ending words, resulting in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.split('')` would return an array of characters, while `w.replace` would replace the matched characters with "ves" in "f/fe
