  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error('Failed to load database')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an error event with a custom error message instead of the original `'load', 0` event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a `'load'` event with a negative number of records loaded, which could cause unexpected behavior in the application.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', this._data.size + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a `'load'` event with a number of records loaded that is one more than the actual number of records loaded, which could cause unexpected behavior in the application.

DONE.
