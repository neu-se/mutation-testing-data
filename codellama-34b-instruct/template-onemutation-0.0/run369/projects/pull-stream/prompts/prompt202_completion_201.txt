  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` would cause the `read` function to be called with an `abort` argument, which would trigger the `abort` branch of the `if` statement. However, replacing `abort` with `null` would cause the `read` function to be called with a `null` argument, which would trigger the `else` branch of the `if` statement. This would result in the `map` function being called with the `data` argument, which would cause the `busy` flag to be set to `true` and the `map` function to be called with the `data` argument.

DONE.
