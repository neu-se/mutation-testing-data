 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null, rejected, progress
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method's first argument is expected to be a function, but instead, `null` is being passed. This will cause an error in the code, as the `then` method will not be able to process the `null` value as a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fulfilled, 'not a function', progress
