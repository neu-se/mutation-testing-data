  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * places
```
This would result in different behavior because the result would be multiplied by the number of decimal places, rather than the actual value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the result would be added to the number of decimal places, rather than the actual value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b / places
```
This would result in different behavior because the result would be divided by the number of decimal places, rather than the actual value.

DONE.
