  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split(" ").reverse().join(" ")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the words in the stack trace, making it difficult to read and understand.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the stack trace all uppercase, which could make it difficult to read and understand.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.replace(/\d+/g, "X")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace all numbers in the stack trace with the letter "X", which could make it difficult to read and understand.

DONE.
