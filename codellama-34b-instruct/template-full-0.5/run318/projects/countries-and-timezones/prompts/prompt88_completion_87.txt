  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"random"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountryForTimezone` function would return a random country instead of the country associated with the given timezone.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"invalid"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountryForTimezone` function would return `null` instead of a country object, indicating that the given timezone is invalid.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountryForTimezone` function would return `undefined` instead of a country object, indicating that the given timezone is not defined.

DONE.
