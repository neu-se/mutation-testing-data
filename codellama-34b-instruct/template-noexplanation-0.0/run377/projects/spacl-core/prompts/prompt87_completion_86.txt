  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(null)
```
This change will cause the `clone` method to return a new policy with a null name, which may cause errors in the code that uses the policy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(undefined)
```
This change will cause the `clone` method to return a new policy with an undefined name, which may also cause errors in the code that uses the policy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(name)
```
This change will cause the `clone` method to return a new policy with the same name as the original policy, which may not cause any errors but may also not have the desired effect of creating a new policy.

DONE.
