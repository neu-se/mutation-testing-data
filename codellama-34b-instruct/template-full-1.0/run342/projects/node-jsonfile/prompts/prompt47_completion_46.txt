  Sure, I can help you with that!

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expect `file` to be a string, but `null` would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expect `file` to be a string, but `undefined` would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expect `file` to be a non-empty string, but `''` would cause the function to return `null`.

DONE.
