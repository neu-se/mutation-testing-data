  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a method that deletes a range of items from the delta, whereas `concat` is a method that concatenates two deltas.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` is a method that retains a range of items in the delta, whereas `concat` is a method that concatenates two deltas.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` is a method that adds an item to the end of the delta, whereas `concat` is a method that concatenates two deltas.

DONE.
