  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the sign of the result returned by the square root function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1/Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the result returned by the square root function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the result returned by the square root function to always return a positive value.

DONE.
