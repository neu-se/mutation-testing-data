  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` event is emitted when there is an error in the database, whereas the `drain` event is emitted when all the data has been written to the database.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` event is emitted when the database connection is closed, whereas the `drain` event is emitted when all the data has been written to the database.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event is emitted when the database is loaded, whereas the `drain` event is emitted when all the data has been written to the database.

DONE.
