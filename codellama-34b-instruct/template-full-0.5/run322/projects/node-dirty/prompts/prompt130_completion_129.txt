  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, cbs] = [1, 2];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment destructured the array passed to it, while this code fragment assigns the array to the variables `key` and `cbs` directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, cbs] = [1, 2] = [3, 4];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment assigned the array to the variables `key` and `cbs` directly, while this code fragment assigns the array to the variables `key` and `cbs` and then reassigns them to different values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, cbs] = [1, 2];

This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment destructured the array passed to it, while this code fragment assigns the array to the variables `key` and `cbs
