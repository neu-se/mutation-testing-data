  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lines[0].startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `startsWith` checks if the string starts with the given substring, while `indexOf` checks if the string contains the substring at any position.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lines[0].endsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `endsWith` checks if the string ends with the given substring, while `indexOf` checks if the string contains the substring at any position.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lines[0].includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` checks if the string contains the given substring, while `indexOf` checks if the string contains the substring at any position.

DONE.
