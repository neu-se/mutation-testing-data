  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `array_slice(args || [])` to create a copy of the `args` array, while this replacement code modifies the original `args` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.unshift(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `array_slice(args)` to create a copy of the `args` array, while this replacement code modifies the original `args` array by adding the node resolver function to the beginning of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat([deferred.makeNodeResolver()]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `array_slice(args)` to create a copy of the `args` array, while this replacement code creates a new array that contains the original `args` array followed by
