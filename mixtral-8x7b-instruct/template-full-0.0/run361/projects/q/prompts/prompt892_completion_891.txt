 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nfcall` function would no longer wait for the callback to be called. Instead, it would immediately return a resolved promise, causing the continuation to be called prematurely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject("Error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nfcall` function would immediately reject the promise with an error message, bypassing the callback function altogether.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
setTimeout(function () {
  Q.resolve();
}, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nfcall` function would schedule the resolution of the promise using `setTimeout`, causing the continuation to be called asynchronously even if the callback is called synchronously. This could lead to unexpected behavior in the continuation.

DONE.
