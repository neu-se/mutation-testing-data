 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
cb => cb && cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because if `cb` is falsy, it will not be invoked, and the `emit('drain')` will not be called either.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => { this.emit('drain'); if (cb) cb(); }
