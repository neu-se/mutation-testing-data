 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options instanceof String
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `options` is an instance of the built-in `String` object, rather than checking if it's a string primitive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for strict equality to the string `'string'`, rather than checking if `options` is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(options) && options[0] === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `options` is an array with a single element that is the string `'string'`. This is unlikely to be true in the original context, so it would likely cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
