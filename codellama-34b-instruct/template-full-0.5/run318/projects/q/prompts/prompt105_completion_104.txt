  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis, this[index], index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` variable is now incremented by 1, which would cause the `basis` value to be different in the next iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis, this[index], index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` variable is now decremented by 1, which would cause the `basis` value to be different in the next iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis, this[index], index * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` variable is now multiplied by 2, which would cause the `basis` value to be different in the next iteration.

DONE.
