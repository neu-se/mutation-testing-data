  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_toString.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_toString` is a function that expects an object as its argument, but `null` is not an object. In the original code, `object_toString` is called with the `this` value of the `exception` object, which is an object. By replacing it with `null`, the function will throw a `TypeError` instead of returning a string representation of the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_toString.call(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not an object, just like `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_toString.call(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a number, not an object. In the original code, `object_toString` is called with the `this` value of the `exception` object, which is an object. By replacing
