  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
let currentUrl of urlMap.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys()` method returns an iterator over the keys of the `Map`, rather than the values, so `currentUrl` would be a key rather than a value of the `urlMap`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
let currentUrl of urlMap.entries()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `entries()` method returns an iterator over the `[key, value]` pairs of the `Map`, rather than just the values, so `currentUrl` would be a `[key, value]` pair rather than just a value of the `urlMap`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
let currentUrl of urlMap.values().reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method returns a new `Map` with the same entries as the original `Map`, but with the order of the keys and values reversed, so `currentUrl
