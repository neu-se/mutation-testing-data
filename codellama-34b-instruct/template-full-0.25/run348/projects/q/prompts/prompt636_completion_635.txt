  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method is called on `null`, which would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method is called on `undefined`, which would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method is called on `0`, which would throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
