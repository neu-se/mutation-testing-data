  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true` when the queue is not empty, even if there are no in-flight writes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true` when there are in-flight writes, even if the queue is empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size + this._inFlightWrites > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true` when there are either in-flight writes or items in the queue, even if the queue is empty.

DONE.
