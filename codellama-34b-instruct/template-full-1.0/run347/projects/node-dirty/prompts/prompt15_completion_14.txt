  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb` is a callback function that is not always called. In the original code, `cb` is called only if it is truthy, but in this modified code, it is always called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, err)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb` is called with different arguments. In the original code, `cb` is called with no arguments, but in this modified code, it is called with `null` and `err` as arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb && cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb` is called only if it is truthy. In the original code, `cb` is always called, but in this modified code, it is only called if `cb` is truthy.

DONE.
