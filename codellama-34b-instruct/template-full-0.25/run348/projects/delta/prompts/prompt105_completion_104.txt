  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.forEach(op => {
  if (op.retain) {
    op.retain = op.retain * 2;
  }
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property of each op would be doubled, which would cause the `length` method to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.forEach(op => {
  if (op.retain) {
    op.retain = op.retain + 1;
  }
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property of each op would be incremented by 1, which would cause the `length` method to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.forEach(op => {
  if (op.retain) {
    op.retain = op.retain - 1;
