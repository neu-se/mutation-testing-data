  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback, arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass only the first argument of the `apply` method, rather than all of them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback, arguments.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass all but the first argument of the `apply` method, rather than all of them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback, []
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an empty array, rather than the actual arguments.

DONE.
