  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substring
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring` is a different method from `substr`, and would change the way the substring is extracted from the original string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the substring to start at the second character of the original string, rather than the first character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` is a different method from `substr`, and would change the way the substring is extracted from the original string. Additionally, the `slice` method takes two arguments, a start index and an end index, whereas `substr` only takes one argument.

DONE.
