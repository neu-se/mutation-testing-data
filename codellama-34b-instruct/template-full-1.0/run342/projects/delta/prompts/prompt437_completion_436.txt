  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.attributes && nextOp.attributes.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `attributes` property exists on `nextOp`, while this code checks if the `attributes` property is a non-empty array. This could cause the code to produce different results if the `attributes` property is not defined or is an empty array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!nextOp.attributes || nextOp.attributes.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `attributes` property exists on `nextOp` and is a non-empty array, while this code checks if the `attributes` property does not exist or is an empty array. This could cause the code to produce different results if the `attributes` property is defined but is an empty array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.attributes || nextOp.attributes[0]
```
This would result in
