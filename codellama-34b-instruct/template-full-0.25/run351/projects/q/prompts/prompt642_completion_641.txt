  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args.slice(1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first element of the `args` array, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args.concat(args)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `args` array with itself, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args.reverse()]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the elements in the `args` array, which could cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
