  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a UnaryExpression returned by the context of the function Q.denodeify.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only provide a copy of the array instead of the original array passed as argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new array with the argument array values concatenated with the array.

DONE.
