Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'wrongEmbedType'
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the handler to be `undefined` (since there is no handler for 'wrongEmbedType'), which would prevent the transformation from occurring, potentially leading to incorrect data being retained.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(otherData)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the embed type from `otherData` instead of `thisData`, which could lead to a mismatch in the transformation logic if the two embed types are different, resulting in incorrect transformations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisData[embedType]
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses the value of `thisData` instead of `otherData` for the transformation, which could lead to incorrect results if the two data sets are not aligned, potentially causing data corruption during the transformation process.

DONE.
