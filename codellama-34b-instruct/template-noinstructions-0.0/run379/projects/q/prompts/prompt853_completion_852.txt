  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clearInterval
```
This would result in different behavior because `clearInterval` is a different function than `clearTimeout`, and would not clear the timeout set by the `setTimeout` function in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` would create a new timeout, rather than clearing the existing one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, and would cause an error when the code is executed.

DONE.
