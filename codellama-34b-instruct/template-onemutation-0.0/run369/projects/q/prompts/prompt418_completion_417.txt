  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the state to be "fulfilled" or "pending", while the new code fragment only checks for "rejected". This would cause the function to return a different value for a rejected promise, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that uses this function.

DONE.
