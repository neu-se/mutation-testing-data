  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { throw new Error("test error"); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an additional `then` handler to the promise, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the given error message if it is fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return Q.reject("test error"); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an additional `then` handler to the promise, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the given error message if it is fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return Q.fulfill("test error"); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an additional `then` handler to the promise, which would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the given value if it is fulfilled.

DONE.
