  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('bacterium', 'bacteria')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a rule for the word "bacterium" to the list of rules, but this new code fragment does not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('bacterium', 'bacteriums')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a rule for the word "bacterium" to the list of rules, but this new code fragment adds a rule for the word "bacteriums" instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('bacterium', 'bacteria')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a rule for the word "bacterium" to the list of rules, but this new code fragment adds a rule for the word "bacteria" instead.

DONE.
