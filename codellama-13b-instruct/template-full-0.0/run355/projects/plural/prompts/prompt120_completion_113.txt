  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add an "s" to the end of the word, regardless of whether it is a singular or plural noun.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace(/s$/, '') }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the "s" from the end of the word, regardless of whether it is a singular or plural noun.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace(/s$/, 'es') }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the "s" at the end of the word with "es", regardless of whether it is a singular or plural noun.

DONE.
