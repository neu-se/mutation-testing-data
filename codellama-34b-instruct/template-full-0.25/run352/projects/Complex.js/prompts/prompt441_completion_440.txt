  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the result to be off by 1, which could lead to incorrect calculations and test failures.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the result to be twice as large, which could lead to incorrect calculations and test failures.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the result to be off by 1, which could lead to incorrect calculations and test failures.

DONE.
