  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber[0] === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `fileNameAndLineNumber[0]` would be `undefined`, which is a falsy value, and `undefined` is not equal to `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber[0] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `fileNameAndLineNumber[0]` would be `null`, which is a falsy value, and `null` is not equal to `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof fileNameAndLineNumber[0] === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because `fileNameAndLineNumber[0]` would be `null`, which is a falsy value, and `typeof null` is not equal to `"undefined"`.

DONE.
