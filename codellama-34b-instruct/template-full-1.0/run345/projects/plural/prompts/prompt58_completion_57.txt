  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('person', 'peoples')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new rule for the word "person" that would change the plural form to "peoples" instead of "people".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('person', 'apple')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new rule for the word "person" that would change the plural form to "apple" instead of "people".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('person', function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new rule for the word "person" that would change the plural form to "persons" instead of "people".

DONE.
