  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[value, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, which could cause the function to behave differently if it relies on the order of the arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument is being passed to the function, which could cause it to behave differently if it expects a specific number of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument is being passed to the function, which could cause it to behave differently if it expects a specific number of arguments.

DONE.
