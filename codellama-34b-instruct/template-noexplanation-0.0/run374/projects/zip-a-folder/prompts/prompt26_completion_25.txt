  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
format, archiverOptions || { gzip: true }
```
This change will cause the `archiverOptions` object to be created with a `gzip` property set to `true`, even if it was not provided in the original code. This can cause the `archiver` function to behave differently than intended, potentially leading to a bug.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
format, archiverOptions || { store: true }
```
This change will cause the `archiverOptions` object to be created with a `store` property set to `true`, even if it was not provided in the original code. This can cause the `archiver` function to behave differently than intended, potentially leading to a bug.

```
format, archiverOptions || { gzip: false }
```
This change will cause the `archiverOptions` object to be created with a `gzip` property set to `false`, even if it was not provided
