  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method returns a string representation of the object, whereas the original code used the `linkurl` object directly, which could have different methods and properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.text
```
This would result in different behavior because the `text` property may not exist on the `linkurl` object, and could result in an error or unexpected behavior if it does not exist.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.removed
```
This would result in different behavior because the `removed` property may not exist on the `linkurl` object, and could result in an error or unexpected behavior if it does not exist.

DONE.
