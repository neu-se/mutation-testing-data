  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
while (true) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the while loop will run indefinitely, causing the script to never terminate.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Purposeful error");
```
This would result in different behavior because the script will throw an error, causing the script to terminate and produce a different outcome than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return;
```
This would result in different behavior because the function will return early, causing the script to exit the function before completing the intended behavior.

DONE.
