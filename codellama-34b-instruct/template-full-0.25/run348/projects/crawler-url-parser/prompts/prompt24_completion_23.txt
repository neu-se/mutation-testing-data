  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[a-z]+/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any sequence of characters that starts with a `#`, while the new code fragment matches any sequence of characters that consists only of lowercase letters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\w+/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any sequence of characters that starts with a `#`, while the new code fragment matches any sequence of characters that consists only of word characters (letters, digits, and underscores).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[a-zA-Z0-9]+/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any sequence of characters that starts with a `#`, while the new code fragment matches any sequence of characters that consists only of letters, digits, and underscores.

DONE.
