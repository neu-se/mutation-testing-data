  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => seg + acc + '$'
```
This would result in different behavior because the extra '$' would cause the regex to match the end of the string, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => seg + acc + '\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the extra '\\' would cause the regex to match a literal backslash, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => seg + acc + '|'
```
This would result in different behavior because the extra '|' would cause the regex to match a literal pipe character, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
