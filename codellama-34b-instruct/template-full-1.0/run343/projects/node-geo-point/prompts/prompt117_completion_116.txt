  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculateDestination function would return a destination point with a latitude and longitude of 0, regardless of the input parameters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculateDestination function would return null, indicating that the calculation could not be performed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new GeoPoint(42, 42)
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculateDestination function would return a destination point with a latitude and longitude of 42, regardless of the input parameters.

DONE.
