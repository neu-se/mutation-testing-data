  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\\\$1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment escapes the `$` character, which is a special character in regular expressions, while the new code fragment does not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'$1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment captures the first group in the regular expression, while the new code fragment does not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\$1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment escapes the `$` character, which is a special character in regular expressions, while the new code fragment does not.

DONE.
