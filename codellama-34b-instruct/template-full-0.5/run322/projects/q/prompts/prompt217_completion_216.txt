  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operation would change the value of the `value` variable, which could affect the rest of the program's execution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operation would change the value of the `value` variable, which could affect the rest of the program's execution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operation would change the value of the `value` variable, which could affect the rest of the program's execution.

DONE.
