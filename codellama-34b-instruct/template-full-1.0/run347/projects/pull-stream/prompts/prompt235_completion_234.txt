  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
shadow
```
This would result in different behavior because `shadow` is a different variable than `next`, and it may not have the same properties or methods as `next`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (end, data) {}
```
This would result in different behavior because this code fragment is a different expression than `next`, and it may not have the same side effects or interactions with other code in the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
del()
```
This would result in different behavior because `del` is a different function than `next`, and it may have different behavior or side effects when it is called with the same arguments.

DONE.
