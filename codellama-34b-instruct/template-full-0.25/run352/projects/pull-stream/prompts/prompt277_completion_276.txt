  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read = stream
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the `stream` variable to `_read`, instead of the `read` function. This would cause the `nextChunk` function to be called with the `stream` variable as its argument, instead of the `read` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read = null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign `null` to `_read`, instead of the `read` function. This would cause the `nextChunk` function to be called with `null` as its argument, instead of the `read` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read = function() { return stream }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign a function that returns the `stream` variable to `_read`, instead of the `read` function. This would cause the `nextChunk` function to be called with the `stream` variable as its argument
