  Sure, I can help you with that!

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would no longer return a truthy value, which could cause issues for any code that relies on this function to return a truthy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would no longer return a function, which could cause issues for any code that relies on this function to return a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"string"
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a string instead of a boolean, which could cause issues for any code that relies on this function to return a boolean.

DONE.
