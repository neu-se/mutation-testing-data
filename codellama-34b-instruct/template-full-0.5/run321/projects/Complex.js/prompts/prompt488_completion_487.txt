  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__esModule": false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Complex` constructor would not be exported as a module, and the `define` function would not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__esModule": true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Complex` constructor would be exported as a module, but the `define` function would not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__esModule": "something else"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Complex` constructor would not be exported as a module, and the `define` function would not be called.

DONE.
