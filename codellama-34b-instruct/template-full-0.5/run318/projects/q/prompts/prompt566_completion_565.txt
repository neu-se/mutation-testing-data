  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `when` is a function that returns a promise that is resolved with the value of its argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a function that returns a resolved promise, whereas `when` is a function that returns a promise that is resolved with the value of its argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `when` is a function that returns a promise that is resolved with the value of its argument.

DONE.
