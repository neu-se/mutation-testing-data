  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `cb` function if the `end` argument is falsy, but this replacement code fragment calls the `cb` function regardless of the value of `end`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (end) cb(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `cb` function if the `end` argument is falsy, but this replacement code fragment only calls the `cb` function if `end` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `cb` function if the `end` argument is falsy, but this replacement code fragment calls the `cb` function regardless of the value of `end`.

DONE.
