Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data.slug
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method is not called, which could lead to issues if `data.slug` is not already a string, potentially causing errors in the `slugize` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data.title.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `title` property instead of the `slug` property, which could lead to incorrect slug generation if `title` and `slug` have different values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data.slug + ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses implicit type conversion to string instead of the `toString()` method, which could lead to differences in behavior if `data.slug` is an object with a custom `toString()` method or if it's a value that can't be converted to a string.

DONE.
