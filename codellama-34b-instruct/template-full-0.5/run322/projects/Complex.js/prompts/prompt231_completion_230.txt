  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `sqrt` function to always return 0, regardless of the input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `sqrt` function to return a different value, which would affect the rest of the calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `sqrt` function to return a different value, which would affect the rest of the calculations.

DONE.
