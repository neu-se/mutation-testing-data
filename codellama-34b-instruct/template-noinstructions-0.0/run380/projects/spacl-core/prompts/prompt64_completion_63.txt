  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.push(rules)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the entire array of rules onto the policy's rule list, rather than pushing each rule individually.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.push(rules[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only push the first rule in the array onto the policy's rule list, rather than pushing all of the rules.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.push(rules.slice(1))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push all of the rules except for the first one onto the policy's rule list, rather than pushing all of the rules.

DONE.
