  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 1, baseIndex + length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice would start at the wrong index, causing the wrong part of the base Delta to be returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - 1, baseIndex + length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice would start at the wrong index, causing the wrong part of the base Delta to be returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex + length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice would end at the wrong index, causing the wrong part of the base Delta to be returned.

DONE.
