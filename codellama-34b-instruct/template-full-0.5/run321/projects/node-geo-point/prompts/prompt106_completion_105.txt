  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 ** zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Math.pow(2, zoom)`, which raises 2 to the power of `zoom`, while the new code uses `2 ** zoom`, which performs a bitwise XOR operation between 2 and `zoom`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Math.pow(2, zoom)`, which raises 2 to the power of `zoom`, while the new code uses `2 * zoom`, which performs multiplication between 2 and `zoom`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 + zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Math.pow(2, zoom)`, which raises 2 to the power of `zoom`, while the new code uses `2 + zoom`, which performs addition between 2 and `zoom`.

DONE.
