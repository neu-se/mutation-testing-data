  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isZero` checks if the real and imaginary parts of the complex number are both zero, while `isInfinite` checks if the real part is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the real part is equal to infinity, while `isInfinite` checks if the real part is infinite or negative infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the imaginary part is equal to infinity, while `isInfinite` checks if the real part is infinite or negative infinity.

DONE.
