  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!shouldThrow
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `shouldThrow`, so if `shouldThrow` is `true`, the negated value would be `false`, and the `if` statement would not be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
shouldThrow === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, so if `shouldThrow` is not `false`, the `if` statement would not be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
shouldThrow && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator checks for both operands to be truthy, so if `shouldThrow` is `true`, the second operand `false` would be evaluated, and the `if` statement would not be executed.

DONE.
