  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/.*@([^:]+):(\d+)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any character except for a colon, rather than matching any character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/.*@([^:]+):(\d+):\d+$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any character except for a colon, and would also match the line number and column number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/.*@([^:]+):(\d+):\d+:\d+$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any character except for a colon, and would also match the line number, column number, and another number.

DONE.
