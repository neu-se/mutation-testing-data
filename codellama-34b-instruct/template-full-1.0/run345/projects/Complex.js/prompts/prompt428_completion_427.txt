  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places || 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code using the mutated function would produce different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places || Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the code using the mutated function would produce different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places || "Hello World!"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code using the mutated function would produce different output.

DONE.
