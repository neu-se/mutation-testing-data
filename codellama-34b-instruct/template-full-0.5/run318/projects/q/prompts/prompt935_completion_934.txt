  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method is used to extract a slice of an array, but by adding `.reverse()` to the end, the resulting array would be reversed, which could cause unexpected behavior if the code relies on the original order of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.sort()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method is used to extract a slice of an array, but by adding `.sort()` to the end, the resulting array would be sorted, which could cause unexpected behavior if the code relies on the original order of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method is used to extract a slice of an array, but by adding `.pop()` to the end, the resulting array would be modified by removing the last element
