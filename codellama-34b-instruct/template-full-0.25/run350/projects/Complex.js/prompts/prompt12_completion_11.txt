  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function would return the same value as `x`, instead of `1 - x`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-x
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinh` function would return the same value as `-x`, instead of `1 - x`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosm1` function would return a different value than `cosh(x) - 1`.

DONE.
