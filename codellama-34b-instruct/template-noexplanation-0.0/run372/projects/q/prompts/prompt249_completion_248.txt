  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.lastIndexOf
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses `lastIndexOf` instead of `indexOf`. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently, depending on the specific input and implementation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.slice(1)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses `slice` instead of `indexOf`. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently, depending on the specific input and implementation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.substring(1)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses `substring` instead of `indexOf`. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently, depending on the specific input and implementation.

DONE.
