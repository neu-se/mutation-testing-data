  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!path, ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical AND (&&) operator to check if both `path` and `ctx` are truthy, while the replaced code fragment uses the logical NOT (!) operator to check if `path` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path || ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical AND (&&) operator to check if both `path` and `ctx` are truthy, while the replaced code fragment uses the logical OR (||) operator to check if either `path` or `ctx` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path + ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical AND (&&) operator to check if both `path` and `ctx` are truthy, while the replaced code fragment uses the addition (+) operator to concatenate the strings `path`
