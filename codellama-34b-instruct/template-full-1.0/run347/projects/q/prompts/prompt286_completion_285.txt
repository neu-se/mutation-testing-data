  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver == "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `resolver` variable is a string "function" rather than a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `resolver` variable is not a string "function" rather than a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof resolver === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `resolver` variable is an object rather than a function.

DONE.
