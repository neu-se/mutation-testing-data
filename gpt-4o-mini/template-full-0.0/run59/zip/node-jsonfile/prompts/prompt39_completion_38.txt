Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.appendFile
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.appendFile` will append data to the file instead of overwriting it, which could lead to unexpected results if the file already exists.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because using `fs.writeFileSync` in an asynchronous function would cause a runtime error, as it is a synchronous method and does not return a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.write
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.write` requires a file descriptor and does not directly take a file path as the first argument, which would lead to an error when trying to write to a file.

DONE.
