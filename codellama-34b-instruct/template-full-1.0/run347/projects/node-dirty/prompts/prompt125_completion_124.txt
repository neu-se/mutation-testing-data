  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `emit` method on a different object, potentially leading to errors or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null.emit
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown, as `null` does not have an `emit` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `emit` method with an empty object, potentially leading to unexpected behavior when the `emit` method is called.

DONE.
