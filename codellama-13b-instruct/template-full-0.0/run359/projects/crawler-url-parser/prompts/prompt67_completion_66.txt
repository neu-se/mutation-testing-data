  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"!="
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!=` operator is used to check for inequality, whereas the `=` operator is used to assign a value. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when the `href` attribute is not equal to the `baseUrlStr` variable, which would result in the `currentUrl` variable being set to `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"<"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<` operator is used to check if one value is less than another, whereas the `=` operator is used to assign a value. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when the `href` attribute is less than the `baseUrlStr` variable, which would result in the `currentUrl` variable being set to `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
">"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `>` operator is used
