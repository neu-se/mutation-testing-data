  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === "function" && define.amd
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `define` function is defined and if it has an `amd` property, which is a common pattern used in AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition) environments. The new code fragment would check if the `define` function is defined and if it has an `amd` property, which is the same as the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === "function" && define.amd && define.amd.version === "1.0"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `define` function is defined and if it has an `amd` property, which is a common pattern used in AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition) environments. The new code fragment would check if the `define` function is defined and if it has an `amd` property, and if the `amd` property has a `version` property that is equal to "1.0
