  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '-'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the parser to interpret a minus sign as a plus sign, potentially leading to incorrect calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '*'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the parser to interpret a multiplication operator as a plus sign, potentially leading to incorrect calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the parser to interpret a division operator as a plus sign, potentially leading to incorrect calculations.

DONE.
