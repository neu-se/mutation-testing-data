1. Use different operators: Try using bitwise operators like `or` or `and` instead of `||` or `&&`.
2. Change constants: Use a different value for the constant variables like `STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR`.
3. Refer to different variables, object properties, functions, and methods: Use a variable or property that isn't related to the `Q` object.
4. Use functions that return different values: Use `typeof` instead of `===`.
5. Use null or undefined: Replace `QReturnValue` with `null` or `undefined`.

Remember to test your changes to ensure they produce different behavior. DONE.
