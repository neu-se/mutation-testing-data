  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseInt(tokens[i + 1]) !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `parseInt` will always return an integer, while `parseFloat` may return a floating-point number. In the case where `tokens[i + 1]` is a string that starts with a number, `parseInt` will return that number while `parseFloat` will return `NaN`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1].charAt(0) === '0x'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be looking for a string that starts with "0x", which is a different condition than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1].includes('e')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be looking for a string that contains the letter "e", which is a different condition than the original code.

DONE.
