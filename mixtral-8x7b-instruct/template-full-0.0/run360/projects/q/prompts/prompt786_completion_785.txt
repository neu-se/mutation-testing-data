 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would always be fulfilled, regardless of whether the input promise is rejected. This could cause issues if the developer is relying on the error handling capabilities of the `catch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { throw new Error('Buggy replacement'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because an error would always be thrown, even if the input promise is fulfilled. This could cause issues if the developer is not expecting an error to be thrown in this scenario.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
rejected || function () { throw new Error('Buggy replacement'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because an error would be thrown if the `rejected` parameter is falsy, even if the input promise is fulfilled. This could cause issues if the developer is not expecting an error to be thrown in this scenario.
