  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.of
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.of` creates a new array with a variable number of arguments, whereas `Array.from` creates a new array from an existing array-like object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.slice.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype.slice.call` converts an array-like object to an array, whereas `Array.from` creates a new array from an existing array-like object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.concat.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype.concat.apply` concatenates two or more arrays, whereas `Array.from` creates a new array from an existing array-like object.

DONE.
