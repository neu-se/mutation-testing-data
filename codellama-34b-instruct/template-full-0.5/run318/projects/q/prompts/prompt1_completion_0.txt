  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof bootstrap !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator would return a different value, and the `!==` operator would evaluate to `true` if the values were different, which would cause the code to enter the `if` block.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof bootstrap === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator would return a different value, and the `===` operator would evaluate to `true` if the values were the same, which would cause the code to enter the `if` block.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof bootstrap === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator would return a different value, and the `===` operator would evaluate to `true` if the values were the same, which would cause the code to enter the `if` block.

DONE.
