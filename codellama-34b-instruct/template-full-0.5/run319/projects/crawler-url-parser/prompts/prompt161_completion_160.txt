  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_without_last_part === pageurl_without_last_part
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the two strings for strict equality, rather than the original code which used the `==` operator for abstract equality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_without_last_part.length === pageurl_without_last_part.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the lengths of the two strings, rather than the strings themselves.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_without_last_part.split("/").length === pageurl_without_last_part.split("/").length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the number of segments in the two URLs, rather than the strings themselves.

DONE.
