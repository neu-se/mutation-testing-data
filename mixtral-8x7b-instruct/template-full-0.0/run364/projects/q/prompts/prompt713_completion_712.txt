 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"keys", ["dummy"]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys` method would now receive an argument, whereas it didn't in the original code. This could cause the `keys` method to behave unexpectedly if it doesn't handle unexpected arguments correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"values"
