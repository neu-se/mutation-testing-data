  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Delta.getHandler` is a function that returns a handler for a given embed type, but the new code fragment `() => {}` is a function that returns an empty object, which would not have the same behavior as the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Delta.getHandler` is a function that returns a handler for a given embed type, but the new code fragment `null` is a null value, which would not have the same behavior as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Delta.getHandler` is a function that returns a handler for a given embed type, but the new code fragment `undefined` is an undefined value, which would not have the same behavior as the original code.

DONE.
