  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.slice(index, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` will return a new array containing the item at the specified index, whereas `promises` will return the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.replace(promise, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `replace` will replace the first occurrence of the specified value (in this case, `promise`) with `undefined`, whereas `promises` will return the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.filter(function(item) { return item !== promise; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` will return a new array containing the items that pass the filter function, whereas `promises` will return the original array.

DONE.
