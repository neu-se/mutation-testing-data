  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"values", []
```
This would result in different behavior because `values` is not a valid method for the `Promise` object, and would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"keys", [1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `keys` expects an empty array as its argument, and passing `[1]` would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo", []
```
This would result in different behavior because `foo` is not a valid method for the `Promise` object, and would cause an error to be thrown.

DONE.
