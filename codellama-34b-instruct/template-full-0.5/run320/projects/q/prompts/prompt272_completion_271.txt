  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise` is a function that returns a new promise, whereas `progressListener` is a function that is called with the progress value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that rejects the promise with the given reason, whereas `progressListener` is a function that is called with the progress value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `notify` is a function that notifies the promise with the given progress value, whereas `progressListener` is a function that is called with the progress value.

DONE.
