  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `emit` property of the `process` object is equal to the string `"function"`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process.emit === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `emit` property of the `process` object is undefined, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `emit` property of the `process` object is null, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
