  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'die'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'dice'`, which is the correct plural form of the word "die".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'dies'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'dice'`, which is the correct plural form of the word "die".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'dice'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'die'`, which is the correct singular form of the word "die".

DONE.
