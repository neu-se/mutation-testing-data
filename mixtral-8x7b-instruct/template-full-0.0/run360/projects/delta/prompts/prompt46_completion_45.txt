 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'0' as any
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the embedType to be a string, which could cause issues if the handler is expecting a number or another type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'embedType'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the string 'embedType' as the embedType, instead of getting the actual embedType from the op object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Math.random().toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a random string as the embedType, which would likely cause issues in the handler, as it would not match any registered embed types.

DONE.
