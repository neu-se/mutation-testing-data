  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the next operation's type instead of its length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the previous operation's type instead of its length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length * otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the length of the next operation by the number of times it can be peeked.

DONE.
