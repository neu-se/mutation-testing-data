  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"put"
```
This would result in different behavior because "put" and "post" are different HTTP methods, and the API is expected to handle them differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"patch"
```
This would result in different behavior because "patch" is a different HTTP method than "post," and the API is expected to handle them differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because "foo" is not a recognized HTTP method, and the API is expected to handle it differently.

DONE.
