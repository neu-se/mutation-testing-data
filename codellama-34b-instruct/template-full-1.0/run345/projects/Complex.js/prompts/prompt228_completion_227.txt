  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(2*r))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the square root of `(2*r + a)`, which is a complex number, while the modified code calculates the square root of `(2*r)`, which is a real number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a+r))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the square root of `(a+b) / 2`, which is a complex number, while the modified code calculates the square root of `(a+r)`, which is a real number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(b-r))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the square root of `(b-a) / 2`, which is a complex number, while the modified code calculates the square root of `(b-r)`, which is a real number.

DONE.
