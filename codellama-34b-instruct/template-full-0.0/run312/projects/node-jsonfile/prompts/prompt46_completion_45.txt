  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFile
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFile` is a function that writes data to a file asynchronously, whereas `fs.writeFileSync` is a function that writes data to a file synchronously. Using `fs.writeFile` instead of `fs.writeFileSync` would cause the `writeFileSync` function to return a promise instead of the expected result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync(file, str, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFileSync` is a function that writes data to a file synchronously, whereas `fs.writeFile` is a function that writes data to a file asynchronously. Using `fs.writeFileSync` instead of `fs.writeFile` would cause the `writeFile` function to return the result of the write operation instead of a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync
