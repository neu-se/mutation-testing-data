  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r + a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the minus sign has been changed to a plus sign, which would cause the formula to calculate the cosh function instead of the sinh function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r * a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the minus sign has been changed to a multiplication operator, which would cause the formula to calculate a different expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r / a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the minus sign has been changed to a division operator, which would cause the formula to calculate a different expression.

DONE.
