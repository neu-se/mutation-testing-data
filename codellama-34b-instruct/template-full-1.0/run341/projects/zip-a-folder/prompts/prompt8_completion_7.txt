  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath !== src
```
This would result in different behavior because it would no longer check for equality between `targetBasePath` and `src`, but rather check for inequality, which would always evaluate to `true` if `targetBasePath` and `src` are different, and always evaluate to `false` if they are the same.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.indexOf(src) === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check whether `src` is a substring of `targetBasePath`, rather than checking for equality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.includes(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check whether `src` is a substring of `targetBasePath`, rather than checking for equality.

DONE.
