  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength(this.index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the next operation instead of the current one, which could cause the `hasNext()` method to return the wrong value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength(this.index - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the previous operation instead of the current one, which could cause the `hasNext()` method to return the wrong value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength(this.index + 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the operation after the next one instead of the current one, which could cause the `hasNext()` method to return the wrong value.

DONE.
