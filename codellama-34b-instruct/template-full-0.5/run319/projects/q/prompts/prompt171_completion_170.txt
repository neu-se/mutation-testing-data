  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNodeFrame()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNodeFrame` is a function that checks if a string is a Node.js frame, and it would cause the `filterStackString` function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isInternalFrame()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInternalFrame` is a function that checks if a string is an internal frame, and it would cause the `filterStackString` function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` is a function that checks if a value is a promise-like object, and it would cause the `coerce` function to return a different value.

DONE.
