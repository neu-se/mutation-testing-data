Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return read(null, done || function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the argument passed to `read` from `abort` to `null`, which may lead to incorrect handling of the abort state and potentially cause the stream to continue processing instead of stopping.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return read(abort && false, done || function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a logical AND operator with `abort`, which could lead to `read` being called with `false` instead of the intended `abort` value, potentially causing the stream to behave incorrectly when aborting.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return read(true, done || function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the argument passed to `read` from `abort` to a constant `true`, which may ignore the actual abort state and lead to unintended continuation of the stream processing.

DONE.
