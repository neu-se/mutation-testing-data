  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a value of `1` instead of `0`, which could cause any listeners for the `load` event to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a value of `-1` instead of `0`, which could cause any listeners for the `load` event to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a value of `null` instead of `0`, which could cause any listeners for the `load` event to behave differently.

DONE.
