 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'=='
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the equality comparison to an abstract equality comparison, which may not behave the same as the original strict equality comparison.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'!=='
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the equality comparison to an abstract inequality comparison, which may not behave the same as the original strict equality comparison.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'>'
