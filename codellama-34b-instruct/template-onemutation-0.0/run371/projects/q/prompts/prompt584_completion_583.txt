  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `return Q.reject(exception)`, which returns a rejected promise with the exception as the reason, while the new code fragment uses `return reject(exception)`, which returns a rejected promise with the exception as the reason, but without the `Q` namespace. This could cause issues if the code relies on the `Q` namespace to resolve the promise.

DONE.
