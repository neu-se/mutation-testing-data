  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 to the argument would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg'] - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 1 from the argument would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication of 2 by the argument would cause the function to return a different value.

DONE.
