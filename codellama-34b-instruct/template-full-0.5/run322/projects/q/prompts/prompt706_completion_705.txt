  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args + args
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate `args` with itself, resulting in a duplicate of the original `args` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the elements in the `args` array, which could potentially cause issues if the code relies on a specific order of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last element from the `args` array, which could potentially cause issues if the code relies on that element being present.

DONE.
