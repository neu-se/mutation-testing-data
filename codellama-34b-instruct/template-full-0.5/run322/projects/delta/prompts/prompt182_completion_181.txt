  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of an array in JavaScript is one more than the highest index of the array, so `length - 1` would be a different index than the one being accessed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of an array in JavaScript is one more than the highest index of the array, so `length + 1` would be a different index than the one being accessed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of an array in JavaScript is one more than the highest index of the array, so `length * 2` would be a different index than the one being accessed.

DONE.
