  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite(tz.d)
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` checks if a value is a finite number, which is not the same as checking if it is an integer. This means that the code will return a different value for certain inputs, resulting in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof tz.d !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` checks the type of a value, which is not the same as checking if it is a integer. This means that the code will return a different value for certain inputs, resulting in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!tz.d
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of a boolean, which is not the same as checking if it is an integer. This means that the code will return a different value for certain inputs, resulting in different behavior.

DONE.
