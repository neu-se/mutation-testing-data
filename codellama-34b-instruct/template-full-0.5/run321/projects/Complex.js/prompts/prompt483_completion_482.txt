  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return !(this['isNaN']() || this['isFinite']());
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked if the complex number was not at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere, while this new code fragment checks if the complex number is at the zero pole of the Riemann sphere.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this['isNaN']();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked if the complex number was not at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere, while this new code fragment checks if the complex number is not a number (NaN).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this['isFinite']();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked if the complex number was not at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere, while this new code fragment checks if the complex number is finite.

DONE.
