 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
5
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns 5 instead of null or the error object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof err
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the string "object" or "boolean" instead of null or the error object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
