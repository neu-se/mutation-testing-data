  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split("@")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method would return an array of strings, and the first element of the array would be used as the filename, which would likely be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.replace(/^.*@/, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace()` method would remove the filename and line number from the beginning of the string, which would likely cause the `getFileNameAndLineNumber()` function to return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.substring(stackLine.indexOf("@") + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring()` method would return the portion of the string after the `@` symbol, which would likely be incorrect.

DONE.
