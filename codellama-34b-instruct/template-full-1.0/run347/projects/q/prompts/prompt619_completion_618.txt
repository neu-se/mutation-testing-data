  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [key, Q(null)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method is different from the `get` method, and passing `Q(null)` as the second argument would cause the promise to resolve with `null`, which may not be the expected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key, Q.reject(new Error("Test error"))]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would reject the promise, and the `Q.reject` method would return a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"mapply", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `mapply` method is not defined in the `Promise` prototype, and it would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
