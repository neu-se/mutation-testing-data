  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `isNaN` method, so if the original code returned `true`, the modified code would return `false`, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite` method checks if the number is finite, whereas the `isNaN` method checks if the number is not a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `im` property is a complex number, and the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, so if the original code returned `true`, the modified code would return `false`, and vice versa.

DONE.
