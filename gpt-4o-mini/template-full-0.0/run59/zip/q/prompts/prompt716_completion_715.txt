Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.invoke
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to call a method named `invoke` on the `Promise` object instead of dispatching the "keys" action, which may not exist and would lead to an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("values", []);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the action being dispatched from "keys" to "values", which likely does not correspond to the intended functionality of retrieving the keys of the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("keys", null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes `null` as the second argument instead of an empty array, which may cause the dispatch method to behave incorrectly or throw an error if it expects an array.

DONE.
