  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the operation from getting a property value to setting a property value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the operation from getting a property value to deleting a property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [key, value]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the operation from getting a property value to posting a value to a property.

DONE.
