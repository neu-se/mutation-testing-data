  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the global object, while `key` refers to the property name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the property name, which may not be what the original code intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the property name with the string "foo", which may not be what the original code intended.

DONE.
