  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNotEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNotEqual` function would return `true` when the two objects are not equal, whereas the original `isEqual` function would return `false`. This would cause the `if` statement to execute the code inside the block, which could have unintended consequences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isEqual(a, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isEqual` function would return `true` when the two objects are equal, whereas the original `isEqual` function would return `false`. This would cause the `if` statement to not execute the code inside the block, which could also have unintended consequences.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isEqual(a, b) && isEqual(c, d)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isEqual` function would return `true` when the two objects are equal, whereas the original `
