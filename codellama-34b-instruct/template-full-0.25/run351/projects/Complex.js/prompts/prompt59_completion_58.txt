  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Number.isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the result of `Number.isFinite`, causing the `if` statement to execute even if the value is finite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isNaN` checks if the value is Not-a-Number, which is different from `Number.isFinite` which checks if the value is finite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a !== a` is always false, so the `if` statement would never execute, even if the value is not finite.

DONE.
