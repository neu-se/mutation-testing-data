  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'img'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment filtered for anchor tags (`'a'`) while the new code fragment filters for image tags (`'img'`).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'base'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment filtered for anchor tags (`'a'`) while the new code fragment filters for the `base` element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'p'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment filtered for anchor tags (`'a'`) while the new code fragment filters for paragraph tags (`'p'`).

DONE.
