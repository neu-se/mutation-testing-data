 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
parts.push('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an empty string to the `parts` array, which would then be included in the final regex pattern. This could cause unexpected matches or failures in the matching process.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
parts.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the last element from the `parts` array, changing the final regex pattern. This could lead to missing parts of the pattern and cause incorrect matching results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
parts.unshift('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a leading slash to the `parts` array, changing the final regex pattern. This could cause unexpected matches or failures in the matching process, especially if the input string does not start with a slash.

DONE.
