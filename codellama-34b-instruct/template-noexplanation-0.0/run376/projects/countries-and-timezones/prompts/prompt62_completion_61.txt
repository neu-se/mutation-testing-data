  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id + 1
```
This change will cause the `getCountry` function to return a different country than the one requested, which may cause the tests to fail if they are not robust enough to handle unexpected changes in the data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id - 1
```
This change will cause the `getCountry` function to return a different country than the one requested, which may cause the tests to fail if they are not robust enough to handle unexpected changes in the data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id * 2
```
This change will cause the `getCountry` function to return a different country than the one requested, which may cause the tests to fail if they are not robust enough to handle unexpected changes in the data.

DONE.
