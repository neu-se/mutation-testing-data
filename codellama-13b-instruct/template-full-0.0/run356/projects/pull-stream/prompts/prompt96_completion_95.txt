  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value is not equal to `null`, and the `cb` function would be called with a non-null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called with a null value, which could indicate that the `test` function did not pass.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called with the same value as the `data` variable, which could indicate that the `test` function passed.

DONE.
