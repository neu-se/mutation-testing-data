  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a case-sensitive comparison, while this replacement uses a case-insensitive comparison.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.match(/[^a-z0-9\:\/\?\#\[\]\@\!\$\&\'\(\)\*\+\,\;\=\.\-\_\~\%]/i)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a regular expression to test for the presence of illegal characters, while this replacement uses a different regular expression to test for the presence of different illegal characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replace(/[^a-z0-9\:\/\?\#\[\]\@\!\$\&\'\(\)\*\+\,\;\=\.\-\_\~\%]/i, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a regular expression to remove illegal characters,
