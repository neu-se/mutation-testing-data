  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick(flush);
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` is a function that takes no arguments, so passing `flush` as an argument would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick(function() {});
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` is a function that takes no arguments, so passing an anonymous function as an argument would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` is a function that takes no arguments, so passing `null` as an argument would cause an error.

DONE.
