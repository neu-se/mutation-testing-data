  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(2 * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the absolute value of `b`, whereas this replacement code fragment calculates twice the value of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(-b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the absolute value of `b`, whereas this replacement code fragment calculates the negative value of `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(b * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the absolute value of `b`, whereas this replacement code fragment calculates the square of `b`.

DONE.
