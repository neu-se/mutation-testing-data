 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
otherIter.next(opLength - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it consumes one less character from the `otherIter` iterator, potentially causing a mismatch in the number of consumed characters between the two iterators.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
otherIter.next(opLength * 2)
