 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { throw rejected; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the rejected reason would be thrown as an exception instead of being returned as a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject(rejected)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately reject the promise with the `rejected` value instead of waiting for the original promise to reject.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.resolve(rejected)
