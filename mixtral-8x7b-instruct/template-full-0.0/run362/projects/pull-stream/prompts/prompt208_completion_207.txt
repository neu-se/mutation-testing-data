 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the data to the callback instead of the `aborted` value, which could cause the downstream code to continue processing the data instead of handling the aborted state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a `null` value to the callback instead of the `aborted` value, which could cause the downstream code to continue processing the data instead of handling the aborted state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Forced error')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force an error to be passed to the callback instead of the `aborted` value, which could cause the downstream code to handle the error instead of the aborted state.

DONE.
