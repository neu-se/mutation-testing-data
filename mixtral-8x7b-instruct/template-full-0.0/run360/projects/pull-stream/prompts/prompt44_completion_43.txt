 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the current execution context, which is not guaranteed to be the same as the `pull` function. In this case, it would likely cause a `TypeError` when `apply` is called with `this`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty object is not equivalent to `null`. The `apply` method would treat the empty object as an array with a single element, which is the `ref` array. This would likely cause unexpected behavior in the `pull` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
