  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property of the `op` object is never referenced in the original code fragment, so this change would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` property of the `op` object is never referenced in the original code fragment, so this change would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attributes` property of the `op` object is never referenced in the original code fragment, so this change would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
