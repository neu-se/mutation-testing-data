Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'[^/]+'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the regex to match any sequence of characters that are not slashes, instead of ensuring that the path ends correctly, potentially matching invalid paths.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'(?=/$)'
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a lookahead assertion that would match paths that end with a slash, which is contrary to the original intent of ensuring that paths do not end with a slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'(?<=/)[^/]+'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the regex to match only sequences of characters that are preceded by a slash, which could lead to incorrect matching of paths that do not conform to the expected structure.

DONE.
