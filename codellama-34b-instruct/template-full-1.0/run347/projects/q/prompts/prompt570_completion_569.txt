  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value, callback, errback
```
This would result in different behavior because it would unwrap the value of the result promise before passing it to the next step in the async function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result, callback(result.value), errback
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the callback function with the resolved value of the result promise, rather than the promise itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result, callback(result.value), errback(result.value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call both the callback and errback functions with the resolved value of the result promise, rather than passing the promise itself to the errback function.

DONE.
