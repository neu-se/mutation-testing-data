  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof options !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would evaluate to `false` instead of `true`, causing the code to execute the `else` block instead of the `if` block.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would evaluate to `true` instead of `false`, causing the code to execute the `if` block instead of the `else` block.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would evaluate to `false` instead of `true`, causing the code to execute the `else` block instead of the `if` block.

DONE.
