  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this.close(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` method would be called with an argument, which would cause it to behave differently than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this.close(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` method would be called with a different argument, which would cause it to behave differently than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this.close()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` method would be called without any arguments, which would cause it to behave differently than the original code.

DONE.
