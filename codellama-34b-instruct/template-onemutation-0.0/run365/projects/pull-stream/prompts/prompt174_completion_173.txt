  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `array` variable directly, while the modified code fragment uses the `array.length - 1` expression, which is equivalent to the length of the array minus one. This change would cause the `i >= array.length` condition to be evaluated differently, potentially leading to different behavior in the `if` statement.

DONE.
