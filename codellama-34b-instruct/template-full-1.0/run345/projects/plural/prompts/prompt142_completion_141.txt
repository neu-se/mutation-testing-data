  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0] === Number(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat the word as a number and try to match it with the rule's numerical value, instead of treating it as a string and matching it with the rule's string value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0] == word
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use loose equality instead of strict equality, which could lead to false positives or false negatives.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].indexOf(word) > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the word is a substring of the rule, instead of checking if it's an exact match.

DONE.
