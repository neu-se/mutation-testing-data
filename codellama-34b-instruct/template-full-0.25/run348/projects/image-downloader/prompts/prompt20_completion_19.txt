  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isRelative
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.isRelative` checks if the path is relative, while `path.isAbsolute` checks if the path is absolute. If the path is relative, the code would not reject the promise as it should.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isAbsolute(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.isAbsolute(options.dest)` checks if the `options.dest` path is absolute, while `path.isAbsolute` checks if the current path is absolute. If the `options.dest` path is absolute, the code would not reject the promise as it should.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isAbsolute(path.dirname(options.dest))
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.isAbsolute(path.dirname(options.dest))` checks if the parent directory of the `options.dest`
