  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val
```
This would result in different behavior because `row.val` is the value stored at the key, whereas `row.key` is the key itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key + "suffix"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append the string "suffix" to the key, which would change the key and potentially cause the code to not find the correct value in the database.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the key by 2, which would change the key and potentially cause the code to not find the correct value in the database.

DONE.
