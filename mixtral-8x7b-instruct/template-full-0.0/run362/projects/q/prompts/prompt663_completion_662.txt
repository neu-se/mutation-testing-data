 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"POST", [name, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the string is now capitalized, which could cause issues if the `dispatch` method is case-sensitive when checking for method names.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"post", [name, 123]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the `dispatch` method is an array that contains the arguments for the method to be dispatched. By replacing the arguments with a constant value, we are changing the behavior of the method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"post", [null, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument of the `dispatch` method is the target object, which is `this` in the original code. By replacing `this` with `null`, we are changing the behavior of the method
