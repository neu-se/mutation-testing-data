  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0 !== d
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `d` is equal to 0, while this replacement checks whether `d` is not equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `d` is equal to 0, while this replacement checks whether `d` is not equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `d` is equal to 0, while this replacement checks whether `d` is equal to 1.

DONE.
