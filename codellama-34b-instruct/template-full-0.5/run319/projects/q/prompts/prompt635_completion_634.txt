  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.del` would throw an error instead of returning a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.del` would return a promise that resolves to `undefined` instead of the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.del` would return a promise that resolves to `0` instead of the original value.

DONE.
