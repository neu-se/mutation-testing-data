  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("apply", ["wrong name", args]));
```
This would result in different behavior because the "apply" method is called with the wrong name parameter, causing a different behavior in the "dispatch" method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("apply", [void 0, args]));
```
This would result in different behavior because the "apply" method is called with a different second argument, causing a different behavior in the "dispatch" method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("call", [void 0, args]));
```
This would result in different behavior because the "dispatch" method is called with a different method name, causing a different behavior in the "dispatch" method.

DONE.
