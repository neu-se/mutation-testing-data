  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This change will cause the `read` function to return `null` instead of `end`, which will result in the `nextStream` function being called again, even if the current stream has ended. This could cause an infinite loop if the `read` function always returns `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This change will cause the `read` function to return `undefined` instead of `end`, which will result in the `nextStream` function being called again, even if the current stream has ended. This could cause an infinite loop if the `read` function always returns `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This change will cause the `read` function to return `false` instead of `end`, which will result in the `nextStream` function being called again, even if the current stream has ended. This could cause an infinite loop if the `read` function always returns `false`.

DONE.
