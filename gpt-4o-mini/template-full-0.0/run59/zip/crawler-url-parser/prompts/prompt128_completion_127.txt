Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `pageurl` is strictly equal to `null`, which would not account for other falsy values like `undefined` or an empty string, potentially leading to incorrect parsing behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof pageurl === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `pageurl` is an object rather than a string, which would cause the function to incorrectly process `pageurl` if it were a string, leading to unexpected results in URL parsing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `pageurl` has a length greater than 0, which would not correctly validate the type of `pageurl` and could lead to errors if `pageurl` is not a string or is an empty string.

DONE.
