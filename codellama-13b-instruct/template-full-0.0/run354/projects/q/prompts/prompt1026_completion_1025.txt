  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method is called on the `object` variable, which would return a string representation of the object, rather than the object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `valueOf()` method is called on the `object` variable, which would return the primitive value of the object, rather than the object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.constructor
```
This would result in different behavior because the `constructor` property is accessed on the `object` variable, which would return the constructor function of the object, rather than the object itself.

DONE.
