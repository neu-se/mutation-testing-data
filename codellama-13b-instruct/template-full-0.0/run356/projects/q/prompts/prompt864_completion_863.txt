  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.delay(1000)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.delay` function returns a promise that resolves after a specified amount of time, whereas the original code fragment `Q` returns a promise that resolves immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.timeout(1000)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.timeout` function returns a promise that rejects after a specified amount of time, whereas the original code fragment `Q` returns a promise that resolves immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nfbind(function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.nfbind` function returns a function that returns a promise, whereas the original code fragment `Q` returns a promise directly.

DONE.
