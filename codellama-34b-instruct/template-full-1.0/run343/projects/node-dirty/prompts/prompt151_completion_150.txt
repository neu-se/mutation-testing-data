  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `err` to be an error object, but `null` is not an error object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `err` to be an error object, but an empty string is not an error object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `err` to be an error object, but `undefined` is not an error object.

DONE.
