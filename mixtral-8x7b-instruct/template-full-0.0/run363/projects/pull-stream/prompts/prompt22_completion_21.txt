 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function being passed to `pull` as the first argument (`read`) would be replaced with the number 1, which would likely cause errors or unexpected behavior in the rest of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function being passed to `pull` as the first argument (`read`) would be replaced with `null`, which would likely cause errors or unexpected behavior in the rest of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the function being passed to `pull` as the first argument (`read`) would be replaced with a random number, which would likely cause errors or unexpected behavior in the rest of the function.

DONE.
