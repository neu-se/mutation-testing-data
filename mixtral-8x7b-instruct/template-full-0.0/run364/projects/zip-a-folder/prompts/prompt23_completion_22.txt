 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
new archiver.Archiver('zip', archiverOptions)
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly sets the archive format to 'zip', which may not be desired when calling the `compress` function with a format of 'tar'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
archiver.create('zip', archiverOptions)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `create` method instead of the `Archiver` constructor, which might have different behavior or edge cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
new archiver.Archiver('tar', archiverOptions)
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly sets the archive format to 'tar', which may not be desired when calling the `compress` function with a format of 'zip'. This could expose issues related to improper handling of archive formats in the test suite.

DONE.
