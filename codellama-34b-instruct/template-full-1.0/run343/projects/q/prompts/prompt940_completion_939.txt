  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an empty array, which is different from the original code fragment that returns the arguments passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return undefined, which is different from the original code fragment that returns the arguments passed to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return null, which is different from the original code fragment that returns the arguments passed to the function.

DONE.
