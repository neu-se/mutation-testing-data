  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `countries` array is empty, whereas the original code fragment would check if the `countries` variable is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries.includes(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `countries` array includes the value `undefined`, whereas the original code fragment would check if the `countries` variable is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries.some(country => country === undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if any element in the `countries` array is `undefined`, whereas the original code fragment would check if the `countries` variable is falsy.

DONE.
