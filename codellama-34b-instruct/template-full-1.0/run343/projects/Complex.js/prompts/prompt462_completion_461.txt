  Sure, here are my three options:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `a + 1` is always truthy, whereas `a` alone may be falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `a - 1` may be negative, whereas `a` alone may be positive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!a
```
This would result in different behavior because `!a` is always falsey, whereas `a` alone may be truthy or falsy depending on its value.

DONE.
