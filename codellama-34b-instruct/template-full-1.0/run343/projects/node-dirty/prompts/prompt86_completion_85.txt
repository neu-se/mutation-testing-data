  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\r'
```
This would result in different behavior because '\r' is a carriage return character, which would cause the data to be written in a different format than expected, potentially leading to errors when the data is read back in.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty string would not add any separation between the data, potentially causing the JSON objects to become merged together.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because a space character would cause the data to be written in a different format than expected, potentially leading to errors when the data is read back in.

DONE.
