  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const policy of policies.reverse())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, so the loop would iterate over the policies in reverse order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const policy of policies.slice(1))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method returns a new array with the elements from the specified start index to the end of the array, so the loop would iterate over all but the first policy in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const policy of policies.filter(p => p.name !== 'admin'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter()` method returns a new array with the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, so the loop would iterate over all policies except the ones with the name 'admin'.

DONE.
