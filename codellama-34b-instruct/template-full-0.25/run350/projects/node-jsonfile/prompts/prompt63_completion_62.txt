  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a new string, while `toString()` returns the original string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.substring(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring()` returns a new string, while `toString()` returns the original string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.substr(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `substr()` returns a new string, while `toString()` returns the original string.

DONE.
