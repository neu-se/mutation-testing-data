  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance by a different amount than the original code, potentially skipping or duplicating operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(iter.peekLength());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance by the length of the current operation, potentially skipping or duplicating operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(otherIter.peekLength());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance by the length of the current operation in the other iterator, potentially skipping or duplicating operations.

DONE.
