 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._flush = () => {};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_flush` method is assigned an empty function, which means that the data in the queue will not be written to the disk when the `_flush` method is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._flush = this.set;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_flush` method is assigned the `set` method, which means that the data in the queue will be written to the disk using the `set` method, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._flush = (key, val, cb) => {
  this._data.set(key, val);
  if (cb) cb();
};
