Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.html$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the file extension from a generic one (like `.php`, `.aspx`, etc.) to a specific one (`.html`), which would not match URLs ending with other extensions that the original regex would have matched.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]{3}$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it restricts the matching to only three-letter file extensions, whereas the original regex allows for any length of alphabetic characters after the dot, potentially missing valid matches like `.php` or `.asp`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[0-9a-z]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it allows numeric characters in the file extension, which the original regex does not permit, thus matching URLs that the original regex would have excluded.

DONE.
