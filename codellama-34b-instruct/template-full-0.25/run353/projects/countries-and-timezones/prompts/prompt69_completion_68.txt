  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones[name] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `!` operator to check if the `timezones` object has a property with the given `name`, while this code fragment uses the `===` operator to check if the value of the `timezones[name]` property is `undefined`. If the `timezones` object has a property with the given `name` but its value is not `undefined`, the original code would return `false`, while this code fragment would return `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `!` operator to check if the `timezones` object has a property with the given `name`, while this code fragment uses the `hasOwnProperty` method to check if the `timezones` object has a property with the given `name`. If the `timezones` object has a property with
