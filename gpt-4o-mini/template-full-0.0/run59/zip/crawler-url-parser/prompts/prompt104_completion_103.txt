Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!tmpUrl.text.startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `tmpUrl.text` does not start with a certain string instead of checking if it includes a substring, which could lead to different results when concatenating text.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `tmpUrl.text` is empty rather than checking for the presence of a substring, which would prevent concatenation if `tmpUrl.text` is empty, regardless of the actual content.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.includes(' ')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `tmpUrl.text` contains a space character instead of checking for any substring, which would alter the conditions under which text is concatenated.

DONE.
