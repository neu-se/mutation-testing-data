  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c !== '+'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `c` is equal to `'+'`, while this new code fragment checks if `c` is not equal to `'+'`. This change would cause the code to execute the `else` block when `c` is equal to `'+'`, which would result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '-'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `c` is equal to `'+'`, while this new code fragment checks if `c` is equal to `'-'`. This change would cause the code to execute the `else` block when `c` is equal to `'-'`, which would result in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `c` is equal to `'+'`, while this new code fragment checks if `c
