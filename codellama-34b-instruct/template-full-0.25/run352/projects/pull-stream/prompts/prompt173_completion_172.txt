  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray(array)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the original check for an array, allowing the code to proceed even if the input is not an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the array has a length of 0, rather than checking if it is an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array instanceof Object
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the input is an instance of the Object class, rather than checking if it is an array.

DONE.
