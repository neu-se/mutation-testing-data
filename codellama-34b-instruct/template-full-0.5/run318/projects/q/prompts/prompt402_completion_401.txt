  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return reason; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws an exception, while this new code fragment returns the reason as a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { throw new Error(reason); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws an exception with the reason as the message, while this new code fragment throws an Error object with the reason as the message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { throw reason.message; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws an exception with the reason as the message, while this new code fragment throws an exception with the message of the reason.

DONE.
