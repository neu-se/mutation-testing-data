  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function would be called with `null` instead of `error`, which could potentially change the behavior of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function would be called with `undefined` instead of `error`, which could potentially change the behavior of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('different error')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function would be called with a different error object, which could potentially change the behavior of the program.

DONE.
