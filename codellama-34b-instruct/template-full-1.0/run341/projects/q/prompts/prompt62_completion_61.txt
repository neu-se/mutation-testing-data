  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.nextTick` is called with a different argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {
    throw "error";
}
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` would throw an error, rather than calling `flush`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"example"
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` would call `flush` with a different argument.

DONE.
