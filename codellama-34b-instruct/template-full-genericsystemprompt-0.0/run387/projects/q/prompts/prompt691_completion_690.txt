  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [null, array_slice(arguments)]
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not the same as `void 0`, which is a special value in JavaScript that represents the absence of a value. In this case, using `null` instead of `void 0` would cause the `dispatch` method to receive a different set of arguments, which could potentially result in a different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 1)` is not the same as `array_slice(arguments)`. The former would return an array containing all elements of `arguments` except the first one, while the latter would return an array containing all elements of `arguments`. This could potentially cause the `dispatch` method to receive a different set of arguments, which could result in a different behavior.
