Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '/').split('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the output from a string to an array, which would affect how the subsequent code processes the `linkurl_parts` and `pageurl_parts`, potentially leading to incorrect comparisons.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '/').replace(/\/old\.[a-z]+$/, '/')
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces an additional replacement that modifies the `linkurl_path` by removing occurrences of `/old.<extension>`, which may not be intended and could lead to incorrect path comparisons.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '/').replace(/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '/').toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because converting the path to uppercase would affect string comparisons later in the code, potentially leading to mismatches when checking for equality between `linkurl_without_last_part
