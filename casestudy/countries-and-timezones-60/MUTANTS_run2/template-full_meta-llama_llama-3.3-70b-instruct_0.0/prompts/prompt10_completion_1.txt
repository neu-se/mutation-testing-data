Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
offset / 120
```
This would result in different behavior because the denominator has been changed from 60 to 120, which would alter the calculated hours value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.ceil(offset) / 60
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.abs` function has been replaced with `Math.ceil`, which would round the offset up to the nearest integer before calculating the hours value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(utcOffset) / 60
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable `offset` has been replaced with `utcOffset`, which is a different variable that may have a different value, leading to a different calculated hours value.

DONE.
