  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && !ended
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is not being checked for truthiness, and the `!ended` check is not being performed on the correct variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && !end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ended` variable is not being checked for truthiness, and the `!end` check is not being performed on the correct variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended && end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!ended` check is not being performed on the correct variable, and the `end` variable is not being checked for truthiness.

DONE.
