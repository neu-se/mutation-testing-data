  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the type of `options` is a string, while this code fragment checks if it is not a string. This could cause the code to behave differently when `options` is not a string, leading to potential errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `options` is a string, while this code fragment checks if it is an empty string. This could cause the code to behave differently when `options` is an empty string, leading to potential errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.indexOf('string') === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `options` is a string, while this code fragment checks if it does not contain the substring 'string'. This could cause the code to behave differently when `options` does not contain the substring 'string
