  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastOp.insert` is not the same property as `lastOp.attributes`, and the code relies on the correctness of the `attributes` property for some of its functionality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[index - 2].attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `attributes` property of the previous operation, which could have a different value than the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[index - 1].insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` is a different property than `attributes`, and the code relies on the correctness of the `attributes` property for some of its functionality.

DONE.
