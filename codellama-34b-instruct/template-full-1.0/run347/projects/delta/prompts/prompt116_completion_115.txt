  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```diff
- reduce((accum: T, curr: Op, index: number) => {
+ reduce((accum: T, curr: Op) => {
    return predicate(accum, curr);
}, initialValue);
```
This would result in different behavior because the index parameter is missing, which could cause the predicate function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```diff
- reduce((accum: T, curr: Op, index: number) => {
+ reduce((accum: T, curr: Op, index: number) => {
    return predicate(accum, curr, index);
}, initialValue);
```

This would result in different behavior because the number of arguments in the predicate function is different, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```diff
- reduce((accum: T, curr: Op, index: number) => {
+ reduce((accum: T, curr:
