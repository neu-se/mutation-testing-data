Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses bracket notation to access the property, which allows for dynamic property names, potentially leading to different results if `key` is not a valid property name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object[keys]
```
This would result in different behavior because it refers to a variable `keys` instead of the intended `key`, which would likely result in an undefined value being checked, causing the loop to behave incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object["key"]
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses a property with a hardcoded string "key", which will only return the value of that specific property, ignoring any other properties that may exist on the object.

DONE.
