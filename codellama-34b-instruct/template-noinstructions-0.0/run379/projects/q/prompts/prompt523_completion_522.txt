  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return object[name].apply(object, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the method on the object directly, rather than on the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return object[name].apply(this, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the method on the object with the wrong context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return object[name].apply(void 0, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the method on the object with the wrong arguments.

DONE.
