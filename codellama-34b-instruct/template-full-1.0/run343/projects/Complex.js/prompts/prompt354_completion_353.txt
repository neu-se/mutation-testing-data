  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the variable `a`, which is not the same as the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the variable `b`, which is not the same as the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the variables `a` and `b` together, which is not the same as the original code fragment.

DONE.
