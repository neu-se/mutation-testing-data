  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `null` as the first argument to the callback, even if there was an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the error as the first argument to the callback, even if there was no error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `null` as the second argument to the callback, even if there was data.

DONE.
