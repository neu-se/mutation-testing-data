  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 2, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0, regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the method to enter an infinite loop, as the variable `baseIndex` would never exceed the value of `Infinity`.

DONE.
