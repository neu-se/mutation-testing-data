  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err && abort, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is different from the `||` operator used in the original code fragment. The `&&` operator will only evaluate the second operand if the first operand is truthy, whereas the `||` operator will evaluate the second operand if the first operand is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err ? abort : cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `?` operator is different from the `||` operator used in the original code fragment. The `?` operator will evaluate the second operand if the first operand is truthy, and the third operand if the first operand is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err ? cb : abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `?` operator is different from the `||` operator used in the original code fragment. The `?` operator will evaluate the
