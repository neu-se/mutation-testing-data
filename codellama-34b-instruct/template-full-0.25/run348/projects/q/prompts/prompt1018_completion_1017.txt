  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would reject the promise, while `deferred.resolve` would resolve it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` and `deferred.notify` are both methods of the deferred object, but they have different purposes. `deferred.reject` is used to reject the promise, while `deferred.notify` is used to notify progress.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` is a method of the deferred object that creates a new node resolver, while `deferred.reject` is used to reject the promise.

DONE.
