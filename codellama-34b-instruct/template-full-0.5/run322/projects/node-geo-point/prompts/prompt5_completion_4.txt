  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!<PLACEHOLDER>.hasOwnProperty('type')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `type` property is not defined on the object, rather than checking if it is defined and has the value `'Point'`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER> instanceof Object
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `point` object is an instance of the `Object` constructor, rather than checking if it is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof <PLACEHOLDER> === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `point` object is of type `'object'`, rather than checking if it is an object.

DONE.
