  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin2
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin2` would return the square of the sine, which is not the same as the sine function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos2
```
This would result in different behavior because `cos2` would return the square of the cosine, which is not the same as the sine function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan2
```
This would result in different behavior because `tan2` would return the square of the tangent, which is not the same as the sine function.

DONE.
