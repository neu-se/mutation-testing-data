  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.regex.test(path)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.regex.test(path)` would return a boolean value indicating whether the path matches the regex, whereas `this.regex` would return the regex object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.match(this.regex)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.match(this.regex)` would return an array of matches, whereas `this.regex` would return the regex object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.replace(this.regex, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.replace(this.regex, '')` would return a new string with all matches of the regex replaced with the empty string, whereas `this.regex` would return the regex object itself.

DONE.
