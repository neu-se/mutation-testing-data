Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b, -a
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the sign of the second argument in the `atan2` function, which could lead to incorrect angle calculations for the complex number, affecting the final result of the exponentiation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the sum of the real and imaginary parts instead of the correct arguments for the `atan2` function, which would yield an incorrect angle for the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, b
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the first argument of `atan2` to zero, which would always return a fixed angle (0 or Ï€), disregarding the actual values of `a` and `b`, leading to incorrect calculations in the exponentiation.

DONE.
