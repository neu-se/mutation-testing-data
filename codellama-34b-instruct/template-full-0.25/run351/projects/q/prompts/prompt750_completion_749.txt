  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `pendingCount` is equal to zero, while this replacement checks if it is greater than zero. This would cause the `onRejected` function to be called for all rejected promises, rather than just the last one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount < promises.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `pendingCount` is equal to zero, while this replacement checks if it is less than the length of the `promises` array. This would cause the `onRejected` function to be called for all rejected promises, rather than just the last one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises[index].state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `pendingCount` is equal to zero, while this replacement
