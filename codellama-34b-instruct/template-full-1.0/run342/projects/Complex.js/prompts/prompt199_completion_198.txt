  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log` returns the natural logarithm of a number, whereas `Math.pow` returns the base raised to a specified power.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a + b` returns the sum of `a` and `b`, whereas `Math.pow` returns the base raised to a specified power.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - a
```
This would result in different behavior because `b - a` returns the difference of `b` and `a`, whereas `Math.pow` returns the base raised to a specified power.

DONE.
