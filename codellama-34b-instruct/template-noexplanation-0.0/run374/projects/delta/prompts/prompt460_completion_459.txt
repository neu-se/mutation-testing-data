  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index + 1
```
This change will cause the `rest()` method to start from the next index instead of the current index, which may result in different behavior depending on the implementation of the `Op` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index - 1
```
This change will cause the `rest()` method to start from the previous index instead of the current index, which may result in different behavior depending on the implementation of the `Op` class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index * 2
```
This change will cause the `rest()` method to start from the double of the current index instead of the current index, which may result in different behavior depending on the implementation of the `Op` class.

DONE.
