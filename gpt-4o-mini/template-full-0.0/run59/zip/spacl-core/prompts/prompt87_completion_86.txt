Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the cloned rules to be created with `null` instead of a valid rule object, potentially leading to runtime errors or unexpected behavior when the cloned policy is used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule
```
This would result in different behavior because it would clone the same rule object instead of creating a new instance, meaning that changes to the cloned policy's rules would affect the original policy's rules, violating the intended deep copy functionality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `undefined` to the `clone` method of the rule, which may not be handled correctly, leading to unexpected results or errors when the rules are queried or manipulated.

DONE.
