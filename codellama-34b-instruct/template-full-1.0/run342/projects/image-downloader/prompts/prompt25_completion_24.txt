  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname()` is the parent directory of the file, while `__dirname` is the directory of the file. This can cause the program to save the file in a different location.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.basename()` returns the base name (file name and extension) of the file, while `__dirname` returns the directory of the file. This can cause the program to save the file with a different name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.cwd()
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.cwd()` returns the current working directory, while `__dirname` returns the directory of the file. This can cause the program to save the file in a different location.

DONE.
