  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"none"
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would be rejected with "none" as the reason, instead of the actual reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would be resolved with null as value, instead of the actual value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject("some error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would be rejected with the string "some error" as the reason, instead of the actual reason.

DONE.
