  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinh` is the hyperbolic sine function, which has a different output than `cosh` and would change the result of the `sin` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const placeholder = Math.sinh;
```
This would result in different behavior because `placeholder` is a constant and would not be updated if the value of `b` changes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b = Math.sinh(b);
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` is updated to be the hyperbolic sine of its original value, which would change the result of the `sin` method.

DONE.
