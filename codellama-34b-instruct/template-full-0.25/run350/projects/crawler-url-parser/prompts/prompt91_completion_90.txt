  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(javascript|mailto:|ftp:)/ig.match
```
This would result in different behavior because `test` is a method that checks if a pattern exists in a string, while `match` is a method that returns the matches found in a string. In this case, the `match` method would return an array of matches, which would cause the `if` statement to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(javascript|mailto:|ftp:)/ig.replace
```
This would result in different behavior because `replace` is a method that replaces a pattern in a string with a new string, while `test` is a method that checks if a pattern exists in a string. In this case, the `replace` method would replace the matched pattern with a new string, which would cause the `if` statement to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(javascript|mailto:|ftp:)/ig.split
```
