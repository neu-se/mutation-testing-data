  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that is called with the arguments `end` and `stream`, while `null` is a primitive value that does not have a `call` method and cannot be called as a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that is called with the arguments `end` and `stream`, while `undefined` is a primitive value that does not have a `call` method and cannot be called as a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that is called with the arguments `end` and `stream`, while `false` is a primitive value that does not have a `call` method and cannot be called as a function.

DONE.
