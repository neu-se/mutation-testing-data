Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'Type'
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison `point.type !== 'Point'` would fail for any GeoJSON object where the type is correctly set to 'Point' but with a different case, leading to a TypeError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'coordinates'
```
This would result in different behavior because the check for the presence of the 'type' property would be bypassed, allowing objects without a 'type' property to pass through, potentially leading to incorrect handling of GeoJSON data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'pointType'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would look for a non-existent property 'pointType' instead of 'type', causing the check to fail and throwing a TypeError even for valid GeoJSON objects that have the correct 'type' property.

DONE.
