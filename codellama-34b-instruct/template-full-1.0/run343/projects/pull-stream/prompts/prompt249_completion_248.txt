  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` function is replaced with `null`, which means that the stream will never be aborted, even if the `abort` event is received.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` function is replaced with `true`, which means that the stream will always be aborted, even if the `abort` event is not received.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
7
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` function is replaced with `7`, which is a number and not a function, so the code will throw an error.

DONE.
