  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `url` property of `baseUrl` object instead of the `baseUrlStr` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr || currentUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `baseUrlStr` variable if it is defined, otherwise it would use the `url` property of `currentUrl` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` instead of a string as the `baseUrlStr` parameter.

DONE.
