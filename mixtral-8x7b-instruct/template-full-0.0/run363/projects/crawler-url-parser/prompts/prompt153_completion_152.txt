 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"".concat(linkurl_path.slice(-1))
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends the last character of `linkurl_path` as a string to the regex replace argument, instead of using an empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
linkurl_path.slice(-1) + ""
```
This would result in different behavior because it prepends an empty string to the last character of `linkurl_path` as a string, instead of using an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
linkurl_path.substr(-1)
