  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider the possibility of `fileNameAndLineNumber` being `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider the possibility of `fileNameAndLineNumber` being positive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof fileNameAndLineNumber !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider the possibility of `fileNameAndLineNumber` being defined as `undefined`.

DONE.
