Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` to the `unique` function would likely cause it to treat all items as unique, as it would not receive the intended field value to check against.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` instead of the `field` variable would mean that the `unique` function does not receive a valid input, potentially leading to unexpected results or errors in processing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field + 'extra'
```
This would result in different behavior because appending a string to the `field` variable would change its value, which could lead to incorrect uniqueness checks, as it would no longer match the original items in the context of the `unique` function.

DONE.
