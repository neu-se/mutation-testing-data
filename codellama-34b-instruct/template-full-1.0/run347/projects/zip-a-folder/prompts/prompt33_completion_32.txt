  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because reject is used to indicate that an error has occurred, while resolve is used to indicate that the operation was successful. Replacing reject with resolve would cause the promise to be resolved even if an error occurs, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw
```
This would result in different behavior because throwing an error inside an event handler would cause the event to be aborted and an error to be logged. In this case, the promise would not be resolved or rejected, and the program would continue executing as if nothing had happened.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log
```
This would result in different behavior because console.log is used for logging messages to the console, while reject and resolve are used to indicate the outcome of a promise. Replacing reject or resolve with console.log would cause the program to log a message to the console instead of resolving or rejecting the promise, which could lead
