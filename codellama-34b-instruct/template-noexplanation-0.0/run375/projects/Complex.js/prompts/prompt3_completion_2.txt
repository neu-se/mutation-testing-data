  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(x)
```
This is the original code fragment, which is correct.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(x) + 1
```
This code fragment is incorrect, as it adds 1 to the result of `Math.exp(x)`, which is not the same as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(x) - 1
```
This code fragment is incorrect, as it subtracts 1 from the result of `Math.exp(x)`, which is not the same as the original code.

DONE.
