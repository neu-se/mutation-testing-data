  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key
```
This would result in different behavior because `row.key` is the key of the row, not the value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `row.val + 1` is not the same as `row.val`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `row.val * 2` is not the same as `row.val`.

DONE.
