  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value[name]()
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` is a method of a function, and `()` is used to call a function. In the original code, `apply` is used to call the function `value[name]` with the arguments `args`. However, in the buggy code fragment, `value[name]` is called without any arguments, which could result in different behavior if the function has side effects or depends on the arguments.

DONE.
