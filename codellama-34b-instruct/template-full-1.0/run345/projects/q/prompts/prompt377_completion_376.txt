  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the original value to `deferred.notify`, rather than the transformed value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("test")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error, rather than passing a transformed value to `deferred.notify`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `undefined` to `deferred.notify`, rather than a transformed value.

DONE.
