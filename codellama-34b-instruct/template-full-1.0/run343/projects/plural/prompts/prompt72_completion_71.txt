  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bone'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would return `'cello'` for the plural form of `'cello'`, while the replaced code would return `'bone'`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cellos'
```
This would result in the same behavior as the original code, as the replaced code would also return `'cellos'` for the plural form of `'cello'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'celli'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would return `'cellos'` for the plural form of `'cello'`, while the replaced code would return `'celli'`.

DONE.
