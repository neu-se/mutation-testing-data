  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because the real part of the complex number would be used instead of the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because the imaginary part of the complex number would be used instead of the real part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() * places
```
This would result in different behavior because a random number would be used instead of the imaginary part of the complex number.

DONE.
