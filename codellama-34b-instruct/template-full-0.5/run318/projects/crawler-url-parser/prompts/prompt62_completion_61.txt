  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.protocol + "//" + parsedUrl.host + parsedUrl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the protocol and host in the URL, which may not be desired in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only include the path portion of the URL, which may not be sufficient for some use cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.href
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the full URL, including the protocol, host, and path, which may not be desired in some cases.

DONE.
