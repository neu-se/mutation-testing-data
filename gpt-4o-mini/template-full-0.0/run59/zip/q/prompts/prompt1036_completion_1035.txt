Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve()` immediately resolves a promise with a value, rather than creating a new deferred object that can be resolved later, which would disrupt the intended queuing mechanism.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` creates a promise that is already rejected, which would cause any subsequent operations that expect a resolved promise to fail immediately, breaking the queue's functionality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because using `null` would lead to a runtime error when trying to access properties or methods on `null`, as it does not have the necessary structure to function as a promise or deferred object, effectively breaking the queue operations.

DONE.
