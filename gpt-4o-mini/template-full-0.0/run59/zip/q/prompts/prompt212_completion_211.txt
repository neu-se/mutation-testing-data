Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value instanceof Object
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return true for any object, not just instances of Promise, allowing non-promise objects to be treated as promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof value === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return true for any function, which could lead to functions being incorrectly treated as promises, even if they are not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return true only for null values, causing all other values (including valid promises) to be treated as non-promises, which would break the intended functionality.

DONE.
