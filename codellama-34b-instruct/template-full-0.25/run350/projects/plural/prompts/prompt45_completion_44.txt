  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a different regular expression pattern and a different replacement string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[^aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a different regular expression pattern and a different replacement string.
