  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, args, 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the extra `1` at the end of the array would cause the `dispatch` method to be called with an additional argument, which would likely cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, args.slice(1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return a new array with the first element removed, which would cause the `dispatch` method to be called with a different set of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, args.concat([1])]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method would return a new array with the value `1` appended to the end, which would cause the `dispatch` method to be called with a different set of arguments.

DONE.
