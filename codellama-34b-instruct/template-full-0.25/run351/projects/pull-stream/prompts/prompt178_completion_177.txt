  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function is not being called with the correct arguments. The `abortCb` function expects three arguments: `cb`, `abort`, and `onAbort`. However, in the original code, the `abortCb` function is being called with only two arguments: `cb` and `abort`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is not being called with the correct arguments. The `cb` function expects two arguments: `abort` and `onAbort`. However, in the original code, the `cb` function is being called with only one argument: `abort`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort(cb, abort)
```
