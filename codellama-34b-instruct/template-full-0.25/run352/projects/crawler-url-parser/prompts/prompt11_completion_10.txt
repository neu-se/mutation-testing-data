  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regex would cause the regex to match all occurrences of the pattern, not just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regex would cause the regex to match all occurrences of the pattern, not just the first one, and also make the match case-insensitive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//gm
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regex would cause the regex to match all occurrences of the pattern, not just the first one, and the `m` flag would cause the regex to match across multiple lines.

DONE.
