 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(accum, curr, index) => accum + curr
```
This would result in different behavior because it performs addition instead of the original predicate function, causing incorrect accumulator values in the `reduce` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(accum, curr, index) => accum - curr
