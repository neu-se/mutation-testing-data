  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only set the name of the policy as the key in the Map, rather than the combination of the policy's name and itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
context
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to set the context of the policy map as the key in the Map, rather than the combination of the policy's name and itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[policy.name]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to set the policy as the value of the key in the Map, rather than the combination of the policy's name and itself.

DONE.
