  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a callback function that was not being called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a callback function that was not being called with any arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a callback function that was not being called with any arguments, and the new code fragment is calling the callback function with an error argument.

DONE.
