  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all` expects an array of promises, but `object` is not an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` returns a promise that is already resolved with the given value, but the original code expects a promise that is not yet resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` returns a promise that is already rejected with the given reason, but the original code expects a promise that is not yet rejected.

DONE.
