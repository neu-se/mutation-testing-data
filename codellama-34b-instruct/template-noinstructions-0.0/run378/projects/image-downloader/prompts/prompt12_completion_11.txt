  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pathname.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `pathname` returns the full pathname, while the new code fragment `pathname.split('/').pop()` returns only the last component of the pathname.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pathname.split('/').shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `pathname` returns the full pathname, while the new code fragment `pathname.split('/').shift()` returns only the first component of the pathname.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pathname.split('/').slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `pathname` returns the full pathname, while the new code fragment `pathname.split('/').slice(1)` returns all but the first component of the pathname.

DONE.
