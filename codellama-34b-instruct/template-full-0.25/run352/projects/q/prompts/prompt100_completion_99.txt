  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index in this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the index is less than the length of the array, rather than checking if the index is a valid property of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index in this.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the index is less than the length of the array minus one, rather than checking if the index is a valid property of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index in this.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the index is less than the length of the array plus one, rather than checking if the index is a valid property of the array.

DONE.
