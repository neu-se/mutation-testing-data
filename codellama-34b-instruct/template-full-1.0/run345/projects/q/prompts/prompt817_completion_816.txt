  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because when the promise is rejected, the `done` method would throw an error, instead of calling the `onUnhandledError` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because when the promise is fulfilled, the `done` method would call `makeStackTraceLong` and `Q.onerror`, instead of throwing an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because when the promise is rejected, the `done` method would throw an error, instead of calling the `onUnhandledError` function.

DONE.
