  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This will cause the promise to be resolved instead of rejected, which may have unintended consequences in the surrounding code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This will cause the promise to be notified instead of rejected, which may have unintended consequences in the surrounding code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Test error"))
```
This will cause the promise to be rejected with a specific error message, which may be more informative than the original rejection.

DONE.
