  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the function is no longer returning the sine of the angle.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the function is now returning the negative sine of the angle.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(Math.PI/2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function is now returning the sine of the supplementary angle, which is the cosine of the original angle.

DONE.
