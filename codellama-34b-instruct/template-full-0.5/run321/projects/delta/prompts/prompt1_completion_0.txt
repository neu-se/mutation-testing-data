  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `a` is not an object, while this new code checks if `a` is not null. If `a` is an object, it will be treated as if it were not an object, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `a` is not an object using the strict equality operator (`!==`), while this new code checks if `a` is not null using the abstract equality operator (`!=`). If `a` is an object, it will be treated as if it were not an object, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a instanceof Object
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `a` is not an object using the `typeof` operator, while this new code checks if `
