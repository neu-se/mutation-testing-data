  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.call(this, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` sets its first argument as the value of `this` within the called function, and `call` sets its first argument as the value of `this` within the called function and then applies the function to the remaining arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.bind(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` sets the value of `this` within the called function and `bind` returns a new function with a bound context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.call(null, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` sets `this` to the global object in non-strict mode, and changes the value of `this` in strict mode.
DONE.
