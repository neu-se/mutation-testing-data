  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would resolve instead of rejecting with an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because null is not a function and would throw an error instead of being called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty object is not a function and would throw an error instead of being called.

DONE.
