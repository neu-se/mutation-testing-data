  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p.source.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because `p.source` is undefined, so the code would throw a `TypeError` instead of returning a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p.stack + "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the concatenated string would be different from the original `p.stack` string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p.stack.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the uppercase string would be different from the original `p.stack` string.

DONE.
