  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` and `Math.sin` have different ranges and values, which can cause the algorithm to produce different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `x * Math.sin` would return a different value than `Math.sin` for the same input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(x + Math.PI / 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin(x + Math.PI / 2)` would return the sine of `x + Math.PI / 2`, which is different from the sine of `x`.

DONE.
