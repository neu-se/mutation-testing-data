  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFileSync)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFileSync` is a synchronous function that returns the contents of the file, while `universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFile)` is an asynchronous function that returns a promise that resolves with the contents of the file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFile, { encoding: 'utf8' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `encoding` option is set to `'utf8'` instead of the default value of `'utf-8'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFile, { throws: false })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throws` option is set to `false` instead of the default value of `true`.

DONE.
