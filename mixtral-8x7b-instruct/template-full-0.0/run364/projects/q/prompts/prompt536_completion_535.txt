 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve()` creates a new fulfilled promise with the given value, while the original code uses the `Q` library's `spread` method to handle the array of values from `value.all()`. The behavior might differ in error handling or promise resolution order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Promise(resolve => resolve(value))
