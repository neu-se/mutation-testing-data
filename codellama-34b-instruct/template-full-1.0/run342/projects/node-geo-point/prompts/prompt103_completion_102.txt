  Option 1: The buggy code fragment can be replaced with:
```
-λ2
```
This would result in a negative bearing value, which is not realistic.

Option 2: The buggy code fragment can be replaced with:
```
λ1
```
This would result in a bearing value of 0, which is not realistic either.

Option 3: The buggy code fragment can be replaced with:
```
λ2 + Math.PI
```
This would result in a bearing value of 180 degrees, which is not the correct value.

DONE.
