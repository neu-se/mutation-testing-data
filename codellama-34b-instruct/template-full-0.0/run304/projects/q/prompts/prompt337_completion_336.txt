  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fulfilled` state is not the same as the `rejected` state, and the callback would be called for fulfilled promises instead of rejected ones.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pending` state is not the same as the `rejected` state, and the callback would be called for pending promises instead of rejected ones.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "unknown"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unknown` state is not the same as the `rejected` state, and the callback would be called for promises in the `unknown` state instead of rejected ones.

DONE.
