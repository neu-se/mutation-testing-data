 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array from the arguments object, excluding the first argument (the callback), which is not what the original code does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1)
