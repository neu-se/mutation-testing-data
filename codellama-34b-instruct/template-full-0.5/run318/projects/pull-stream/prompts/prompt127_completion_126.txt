  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i--)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment increments `i` before calling the callback, while this modified code fragment decrements `i` before calling the callback. This could potentially cause the callback to be called with a different value of `i` than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, max)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment increments `i` before calling the callback, while this modified code fragment calls the callback with the value of `max` instead of `i`. This could potentially cause the callback to be called with a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment increments `i` before calling the callback, while this modified code fragment increments `i` by one before calling the callback. This could potentially cause the
