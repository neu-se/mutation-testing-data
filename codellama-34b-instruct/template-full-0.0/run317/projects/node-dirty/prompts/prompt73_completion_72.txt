  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code === 'ENOENT' || err.code === 'EACCES'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also check for the "EACCES" error code, which is not checked in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code !== 'ENOENT'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for any error code other than "ENOENT", whereas the original code fragment only checks for "ENOENT".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code === 'EISDIR'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for the "EISDIR" error code, which is not checked in the original code fragment.

DONE.
