  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
__filename
```
This would result in different behavior because `__filename` is a variable that contains the name of the current file, while `__dirname` is a variable that contains the name of the current directory. In the original code, `__dirname` is used to resolve the destination path, but if we replace it with `__filename`, the destination path will be resolved relative to the current file instead of the current directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.join(__dirname, '..')
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.join(__dirname, '..')` is a function that joins two paths together, but if we replace it with `__dirname`, the destination path will be resolved relative to the current directory instead of the parent directory.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.resolve(__dirname, '..')
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.resolve(__dirname, '..')` is a function that resolves a path relative to the current directory
