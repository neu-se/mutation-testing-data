  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cbrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cbrt` returns the cube root of a number, whereas `Math.sqrt` returns the square root.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(2, a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.pow(2, a)` returns 2 raised to the power of `a`, whereas `Math.sqrt` returns the square root of a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin(a)` returns the sine of `a`, whereas `Math.sqrt` returns the square root of a number.

DONE.
