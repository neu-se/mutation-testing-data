  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a method call, but `Math.sqrt` is a method reference. The method reference would not be called, resulting in a different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a method call, but `a` is a variable reference. The variable reference would not be called, resulting in a different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a method call, but `1` is a number. The number would not be called, resulting in a different behavior.

DONE.
