  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 1];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns the delta with the final operation removed, while this code returns the final operation itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.ops[delta.ops.length / 2];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns the delta with the final operation removed, while this code returns a different operation in the middle of the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.slice(0, delta.length - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns the delta with the final operation removed, while this code returns the entire delta except for the last operation.

DONE.
