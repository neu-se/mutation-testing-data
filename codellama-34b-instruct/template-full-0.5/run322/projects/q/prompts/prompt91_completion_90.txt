  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` returns a new array with the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, while `slice` returns a new array with the elements of the original array, starting from the specified position.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.sort
```
This would result in different behavior because `sort` returns a new array with the elements of the original array, sorted in place, while `slice` returns a new array with the elements of the original array, starting from the specified position.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.reverse
```
This would result in different behavior because `reverse` returns a new array with the elements of the original array in reverse order, while `slice` returns a new array with the elements of the original array, starting from the specified position.

DONE.
