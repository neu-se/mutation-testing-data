  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, end
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the order of the parameters passed to the `cb` function, which could potentially cause a failure if the function expects them to be in a specific order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, data
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the first parameter of the `cb` function to `null`, which could potentially cause a failure if the function expects it to be non-null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the second parameter of the `cb` function to `null`, which could potentially cause a failure if the function expects it to be non-null.

DONE.
