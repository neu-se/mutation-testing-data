  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would result in the `runSingle` function being called with `undefined` as the `task` argument, which would likely cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would result in the `runSingle` function being called with `null` as the `task` argument, which would likely cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would result in the `runSingle` function being called with `0` as the `task` argument, which would cause it to be treated as a function and executed as a task, but it would likely cause an error because `0` is not a valid function.

DONE.
