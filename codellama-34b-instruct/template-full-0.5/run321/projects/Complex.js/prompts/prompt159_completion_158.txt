  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero'](<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method is not defined in the `Complex` class, so it would throw a `ReferenceError` instead of returning a `Complex` object as expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero'](a);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method is not defined in the `Complex` class, so it would throw a `ReferenceError` instead of returning a `Complex` object as expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero'](z);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method is not defined in the `Complex` class, so it would throw a `ReferenceError` instead of returning a `Complex` object as expected.

DONE.
