Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` always rounds down to the nearest integer, while `Math.round` rounds to the nearest integer, which could lead to different results for values that are not whole numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil(this['im'] * places) / places
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil` rounds up to the nearest integer, which would yield a different result compared to `Math.round`, especially for values that are not whole numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the rounding entirely, returning the raw product of `this['im']` and `places`, which could lead to a loss of precision and a different representation of the complex number.

DONE.
