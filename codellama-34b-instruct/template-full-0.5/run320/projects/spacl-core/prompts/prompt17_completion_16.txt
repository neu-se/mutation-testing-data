  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const { regex, props } = compile(spec)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `compile` function with the `spec` parameter, which is not the intended behavior. The `compile` function is only meant to be used as a helper function to generate the regex and props for the `Matcher` class, and it should not be called directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const { regex, props } = { regex: spec, props: [] }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different object with the same properties as the one returned by the `compile` function. The `regex` property of the returned object would be set to the `spec` parameter, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const { regex, props } = { regex: /^$/, props: [] }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different object with the same properties
