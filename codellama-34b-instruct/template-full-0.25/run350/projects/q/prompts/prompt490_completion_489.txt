  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the truthiness of the `rejected` variable, so the `if` statement would always evaluate to `false`, even if the promise is rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator short-circuits if the first operand is falsy, so the `if` statement would always evaluate to `false`, even if the promise is rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator short-circuits if the first operand is truthy, so the `if` statement would always evaluate to `true`, even if the promise is rejected.

DONE.
