  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone.r === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `timezone.r` is truthy, while this code checks if it is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone.r !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `timezone.r` is truthy, while this code checks if it is not null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!timezone.r
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `timezone.r` is truthy, while this code checks if it is falsy.

DONE.
