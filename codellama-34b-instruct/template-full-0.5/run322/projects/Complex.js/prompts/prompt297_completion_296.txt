  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function has a different range of values than the `sinh` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tanh
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tanh` function has a different range of values than the `sinh` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function has a different range of values than the `sinh` function.

DONE.
