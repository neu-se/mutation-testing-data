  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.extname(options.dest) === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.extname()` returns the extension of the file, including the dot. So, `path.extname(options.dest) === ''` checks if the file has an extension or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename(options.dest).startsWith('.')
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.basename()` returns the base name of the file without the directory path or extension. So, `path.basename(options.dest).startsWith('.')` checks if the file has a dot at the beginning of its base name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(options.dest) !== ''
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname()` returns the directory path of the file, so `path.dirname(options.dest) !== ''` checks if the file has a directory path
