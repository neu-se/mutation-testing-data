  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue = (resolvedPromise ? resolvedPromise : promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise instead of using the existing `resolvedPromise` and `promise` variables.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trueValue = !value; // invert the value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the value of `value` before passing it to `resolvedPromise`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nullValue = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` instead of `value` to `resolvedPromise`.

DONE.
