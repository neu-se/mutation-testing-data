  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero'](0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method checks if the complex number is equal to zero, but passing `0` as an argument would always return `false`, even if the complex number is actually zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero'](1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method checks if the complex number is equal to zero, but passing `1` as an argument would always return `true`, even if the complex number is not actually zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero'](this['re'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method checks if the complex number is equal to zero, but passing `this['re']` as an argument would always return `false`, even if the complex number is actually zero.

DONE.
