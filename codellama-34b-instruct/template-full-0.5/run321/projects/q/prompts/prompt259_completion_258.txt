Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(fulfill(value))

This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` is a function that returns a resolved promise, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a resolved promise. Additionally, `fulfill` is a function that returns a resolved promise, so `Q.resolve(fulfill(value))` would result in a resolved promise, whereas `Q` would result in a pending promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(reject(reason))
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a resolved promise. Additionally, `reject` is a function that returns
