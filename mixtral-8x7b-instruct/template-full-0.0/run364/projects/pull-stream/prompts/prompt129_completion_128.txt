 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i++)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only calls `cb` with a single argument, whereas this modification calls `cb` with two arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(i++)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls `cb` with a single `null` argument, whereas this modification calls `cb` with a single argument being the current count `i`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only calls `cb` with a single argument when the counter `i` exceeds the maximum value `max`, whereas this modification calls `cb` with a single argument `true` regardless of the counter value.

DONE.
