  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(name)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezone` function is called with the `name` parameter, which is a string, instead of the `tzName` parameter, which is an object. This would cause the function to return `null` instead of the expected timezone object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(tzName.name)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezone` function is called with the `name` property of the `tzName` object, which is a string, instead of the `tzName` object itself. This would cause the function to return `null` instead of the expected timezone object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(tzName.name.toUpperCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezone` function is called with the uppercase version of the `name` property of the `tzName`
