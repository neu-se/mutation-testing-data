  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer.resolve()` would immediately resolve the promise, whereas the original code `defer` would create a new promise that would be resolved later.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer.reject()` would immediately reject the promise, whereas the original code `defer` would create a new promise that would be resolved later.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.notify()
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer.notify()` would immediately notify the promise, whereas the original code `defer` would create a new promise that would be resolved later.

DONE.
