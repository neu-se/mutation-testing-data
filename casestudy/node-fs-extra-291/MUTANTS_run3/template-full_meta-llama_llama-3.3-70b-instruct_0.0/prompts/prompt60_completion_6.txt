Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'$'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string would only escape a single '$' character instead of two, potentially leading to incorrect path replacements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'$$' + targetPath
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append the `targetPath` to the replacement string, potentially causing incorrect path constructions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the escaping of '$' characters altogether, potentially leading to incorrect path replacements or unexpected behavior when the `targetPath` contains '$' characters.

DONE.
