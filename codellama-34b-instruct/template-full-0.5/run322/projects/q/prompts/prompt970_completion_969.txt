  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.npost` method expects a string as the first argument, but `null` is not a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"not-a-function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.npost` method expects a function as the first argument, but `"not-a-function"` is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.npost` method expects a function with a specific name as the first argument, but the function created by `function () {}` does not have a name.

DONE.
