  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return cb(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abortCb` calls the `abortCb` function, which is not the same as calling `cb` with `false` as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return cb(null, array[i++])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abortCb` calls the `abortCb` function, which is not the same as calling `cb` with `null` and `array[i++]` as arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return cb(array[i++])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abortCb` calls the `abortCb` function, which is not the same as calling `cb` with `array[i++]` as an argument.

DONE.
