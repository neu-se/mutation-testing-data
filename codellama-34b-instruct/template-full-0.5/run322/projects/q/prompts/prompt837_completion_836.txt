  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw error;
```
This would result in different behavior because the error would be thrown immediately, rather than being forwarded to the next tick.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.domain.bind(error, promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because the error would be bound to the process domain, rather than being forwarded to the next tick.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nextTick(error, promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because the error would be passed to Q.nextTick, rather than being forwarded to the next tick.

DONE.
