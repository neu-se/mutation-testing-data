  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain + firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add `firstLeft` to `firstOther.retain` instead of subtracting it, potentially causing the `while` loop to continue even if `firstOther.retain` is less than or equal to `firstLeft`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain * firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply `firstOther.retain` by `firstLeft` instead of subtracting them, potentially causing the `while` loop to continue even if `firstOther.retain` is less than or equal to `firstLeft`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain / firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because it would divide `firstOther.retain` by `firstLeft` instead of subtracting them, potentially causing the `while` loop to continue even if `firstOther.retain`
