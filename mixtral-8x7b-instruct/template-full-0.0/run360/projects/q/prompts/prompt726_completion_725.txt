 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method would not be called on the promise, and the state would not be checked. This could cause issues if the promise is still pending, leading to different behavior in the `all` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `snapshot.state` would be undefined, causing the `if` condition to fail. This could lead to the function not properly handling fulfilled promises, causing different behavior in the `all` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ state: 'unknown' }
