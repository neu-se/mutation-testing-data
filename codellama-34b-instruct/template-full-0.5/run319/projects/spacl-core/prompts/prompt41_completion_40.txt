  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches a forward slash, while the replacement code fragment matches a backslash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches a forward slash, while the replacement code fragment matches a forward slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'[/]'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches a forward slash, while the replacement code fragment matches a forward slash or a backslash.

DONE.
