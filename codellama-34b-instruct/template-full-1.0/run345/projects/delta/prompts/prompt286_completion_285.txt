  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\n\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `indexOf` method to find the index of the first newline character, and our new fragment would return the index of the second newline character instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `length` property to get the length of the text, and our new fragment would return the length of a single space character instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `split` method to split the text into lines, and our new fragment would return an array with a single null element instead.

DONE.
