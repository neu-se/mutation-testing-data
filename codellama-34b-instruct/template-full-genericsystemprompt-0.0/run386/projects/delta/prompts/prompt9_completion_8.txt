  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const key in a) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the properties of the `a` object, but it would not check if the property is defined in the `b` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const key in b) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the properties of the `b` object, but it would not check if the property is defined in the `a` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const key in a) {
  if (a[key] !== undefined && b[key] === undefined) {
    attributes[key] = a[key];
  }
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the property is defined in both the `a` and `b` objects, and if it is not defined in `b`, it would assign the value from `a` to the `
