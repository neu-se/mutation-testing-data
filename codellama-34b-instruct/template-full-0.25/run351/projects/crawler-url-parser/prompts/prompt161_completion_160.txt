  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_without_last_part === pageurl_without_last_part
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, including the type of the operands, whereas the `==` operator checks for loose equality, which only checks the value of the operands.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_without_last_part != pageurl_without_last_part
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!=` operator checks for inequality, whereas the `==` operator checks for equality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_without_last_part.length === pageurl_without_last_part.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of a string returns the number of characters in the string, and the `===` operator checks for strict equality, including the type of the operands.

DONE.
