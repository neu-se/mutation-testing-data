Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.statusCode + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the status code sent in the response would be incremented by 1, potentially changing the interpretation of the response by the client.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
res.statusCode
```
This would result in different behavior because `res.statusCode` is used instead of `this.statusCode`, which could lead to differences if the context of `this` has changed, potentially causing the wrong status code to be sent.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
200
```
This would result in different behavior because a fixed status code of 200 (OK) would always be sent, regardless of the actual status code of the response, potentially masking errors or other status codes that should be reported to the client.

DONE.
