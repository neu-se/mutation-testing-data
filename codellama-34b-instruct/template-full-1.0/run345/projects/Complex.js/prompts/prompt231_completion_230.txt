  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan2` function would not receive the correct `b` value, leading to an incorrect computation of the complex sine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan2` function would receive a different `b` value, leading to an incorrect computation of the complex sine.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan2` function would receive a different `b` value, leading to an incorrect computation of the complex sine.

DONE.
