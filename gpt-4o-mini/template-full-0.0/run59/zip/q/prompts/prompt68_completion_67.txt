Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes a numeric argument to the `flush` function, which may not be expected and could lead to errors or unintended behavior if `flush` is not designed to handle parameters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes a `null` value to the `flush` function, which may cause it to behave differently if it checks for the presence of a valid argument or if it tries to operate on the argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly passes `undefined` to the `flush` function, which could lead to different execution paths or errors if the function expects a defined value or performs operations based on the argument's type.

DONE.
