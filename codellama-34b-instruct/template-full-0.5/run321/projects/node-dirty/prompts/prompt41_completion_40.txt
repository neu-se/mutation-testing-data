  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key` variable is incremented, which would cause the `get` method to return a different value than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key` variable is decremented, which would cause the `get` method to return a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key` variable is multiplied by 2, which would cause the `get` method to return a different value than the original code.

DONE.
