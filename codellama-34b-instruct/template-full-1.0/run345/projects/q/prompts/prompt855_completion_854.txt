  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code resolves the promise with the value, while the modified code rejects the promise with the same value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code resolves the promise with the value, while the modified code resolves the promise with a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code resolves the promise with the value, while the modified code notifies the promise with a progress update.

DONE.
