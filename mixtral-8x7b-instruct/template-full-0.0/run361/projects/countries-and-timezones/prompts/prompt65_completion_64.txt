 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
countries['id']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would look for a string 'id' as the key instead of using the value of the id variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
countries[1234] // assuming 1234 is not a valid country id
```
This would result in different behavior because it would look for a non-existent country id, and if the original code did not handle such cases, it could lead to unexpected results or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
countries[id].name
