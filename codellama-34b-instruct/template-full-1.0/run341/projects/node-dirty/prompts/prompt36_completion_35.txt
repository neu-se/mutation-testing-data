  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delete this._data[key];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the key entirely from the map, whereas the original code fragment would only delete the value associated with the key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data[key] = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value associated with the key to `undefined`, whereas the original code fragment would delete the key-value pair from the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data[key] = key;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value associated with the key to the key itself, whereas the original code fragment would set the value to the value passed as an argument to the `set` method.

DONE.
