  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nfapply` method is called with a rejected promise, which would result in the `deferred.reject` method being called on the `deferred` object, causing the returned promise to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nfapply` method is called with `undefined` as the first argument, which would result in an error being thrown when `callback.apply` is called, causing the returned promise to be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nfapply` method is called with `null` as the first argument, which would result in an error being thrown when `callback.apply` is called, causing the returned promise to be rejected.

DONE.
