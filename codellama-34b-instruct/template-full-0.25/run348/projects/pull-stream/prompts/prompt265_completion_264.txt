  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a variable that is expected to be defined in the scope of the function, while `null` is a constant value that would cause the function to return `null` instead of the expected data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a variable that is expected to be defined in the scope of the function, while `undefined` is a constant value that would cause the function to return `undefined` instead of the expected data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a variable that is expected to be defined in the scope of the function, while `''` is an empty string that would cause the function to return an empty string instead of the expected data.

DONE.
