 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 * bearing
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the `bearing` to a number using the multiplication operator, which is less explicit and less performant than the original `Number()` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
parseFloat(bearing)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `parseFloat()` function, which only converts the initial portion of the input string to a number, while `Number()` converts the entire string. This could lead to different results when the `bearing` value contains trailing non-numeric characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.floor(bearing)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Math.floor()` function, which rounds the input value down to the nearest integer. This would change the behavior of the `calculateDestination()` method, as it would always use a rounded bearing value,
