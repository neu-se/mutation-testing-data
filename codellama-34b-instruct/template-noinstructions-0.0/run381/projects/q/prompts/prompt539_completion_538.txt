  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return array;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` method would return a promise that is resolved with the array of values, rather than a promise that is resolved with the array of promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(array);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` method would return a promise that is resolved with the array of promises, rather than a promise that is resolved with the array of values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return array.map(function(value) {
    return Q(value);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` method would return a promise that is resolved with the array of promises, rather than a promise that is resolved with the array of values.

DONE.
