  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test + false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator has a higher precedence than the `!` operator, so the `!` would be applied to the result of `test + false` instead of to `test` directly, which would change the boolean value that is being negated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test * true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator has a higher precedence than the `!` operator, so the `!` would be applied to the result of `test * true` instead of to `test` directly, which would change the boolean value that is being negated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test ?? false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `??` operator has a higher precedence than the `!` operator, so the `!` would be applied to the result of `test ?? false` instead of to `test` directly, which would change
