  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
++index < length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment `index` before checking if it is less than `length`, which could cause the loop to continue running even if `index >= length`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `index` is less than or equal to `length`, which could cause the loop to run more times than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `index` is less than `length + 1`, which could cause the loop to run more times than intended.

DONE.
