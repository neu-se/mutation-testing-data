  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect(84);
```
This would result in different behavior because the call to `inspect` would return a different value, and the subsequent check for the state of the promise would be based on incorrect information.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.resolve(function () { return reason; });
```
This would result in different behavior because the call to `resolve` would return a different promise, and the subsequent check for the state of the promise would be based on incorrect information.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect(function () { return "rejected"; });
```
This would result in different behavior because the call to `inspect` would return a different value, and the subsequent check for the state of the promise would be based on incorrect information.

DONE.
