  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const [key, val] of this._data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the data in a different order than the original code, which could cause the test suite to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const [key, val] of Object.entries(this._data))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the data as an array of key-value pairs, rather than an actual object. This could cause the test suite to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const [key, val] of this._data.entries())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the data as an array of key-value pairs, rather than an actual object. This could cause the test suite to fail.

DONE.
