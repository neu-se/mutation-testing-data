  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a + 1` expression would always evaluate to a positive value, whereas the original `a` expression could evaluate to a negative value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a * 2` expression would always evaluate to a larger value than the original `a` expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a / 2` expression would always evaluate to a smaller value than the original `a` expression.

DONE.
