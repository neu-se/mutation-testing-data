  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(input / 61)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would round the input to the nearest 61st instead of the nearest 60th.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
input + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the input instead of rounding it down.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil(input / 60)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would round the input up to the nearest 60th instead of rounding it down.

DONE.
