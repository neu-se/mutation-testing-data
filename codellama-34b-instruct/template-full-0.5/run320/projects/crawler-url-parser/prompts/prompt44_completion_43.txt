  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would not be called with the `true` option, which means that the parsed URL object would not have the `auth` and `hash` properties set.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would be called with the `null` option, which means that the parsed URL object would not have the `auth` and `hash` properties set.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would be called with the `undefined` option, which means that the parsed URL object would not have the `auth` and `hash` properties set.

DONE.
