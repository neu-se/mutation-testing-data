  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(b) < Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the absolute value of the imaginary part of the complex number, rather than the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(a + b) < Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the absolute value of the sum of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, rather than just the real part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(a - b) < Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the absolute value of the difference between the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, rather than just the real part.

DONE.
