  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `parse` function to accept null as a valid `b` value, whereas the original code fragment only allows undefined values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Boolean(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `parse` function to accept any falsy value as a valid `b` value, whereas the original code fragment only allows undefined values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNaN(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `parse` function to accept any value that is not a number as a valid `b` value, whereas the original code fragment only allows undefined values.

DONE.
