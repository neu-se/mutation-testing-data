 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek() !== null || otherIter.peek() !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the existence of a next element instead of checking if the iterator has a next element. This could lead to skipping or adding unnecessary operations if the first or last operation is not being considered.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() !== undefined || otherIter.peekType() !== undefined
