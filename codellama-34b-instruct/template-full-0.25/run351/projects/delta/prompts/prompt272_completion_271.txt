  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue even if there are no more operations to iterate over, leading to an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to exit early, potentially missing some operations that need to be applied.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to skip over any 'insert' operations, potentially leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
