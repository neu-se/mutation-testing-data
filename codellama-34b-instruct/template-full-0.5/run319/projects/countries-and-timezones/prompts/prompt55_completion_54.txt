  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not an object, and `Object.keys()` would throw a `TypeError` when called on it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an object, and `Object.keys()` would throw a `TypeError` when called on it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object, and `Object.keys()` would return an empty array when called on it.

DONE.
