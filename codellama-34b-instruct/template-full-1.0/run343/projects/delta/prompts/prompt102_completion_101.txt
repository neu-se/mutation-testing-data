  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.pop(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the pop() method returns the value that was removed from the array, not the array itself. By returning this instead, we are able to chain method calls and perform additional operations on the returned value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because the push() method adds an element to the end of an array, whereas the pop() method removes an element from the end of an array and returns it. By pushing the newOp onto the end of the array, we can ensure that it is included in the resulting composition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(this.ops.length - 1, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the splice() method removes a specified number of elements from an array starting at a specified index. By splic
