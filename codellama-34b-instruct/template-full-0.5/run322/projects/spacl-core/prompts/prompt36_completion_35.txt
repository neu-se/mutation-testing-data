  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(2).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first segment of the path, which could cause the matcher to fail to match certain paths that it should have matched.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().join('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would join the segments of the path back together with a '/' character, which could cause the matcher to fail to match certain paths that it should have matched.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would join the segments of the path back together with an empty string, which could cause the matcher to fail to match certain paths that it should have matched.

DONE.
