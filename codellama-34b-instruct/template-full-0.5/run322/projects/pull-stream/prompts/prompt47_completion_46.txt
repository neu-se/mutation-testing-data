  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would not iterate at all, potentially leading to errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i === length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only iterate once, potentially leading to errors.

DONE.
