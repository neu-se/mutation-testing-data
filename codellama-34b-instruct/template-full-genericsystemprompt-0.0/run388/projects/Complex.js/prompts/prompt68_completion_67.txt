  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parser_exit` function would be called with an argument, which would cause it to throw a different error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parser_exit` function would be called with a null argument, which would cause it to throw a different error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parser_exit` function would be called with an undefined argument, which would cause it to throw a different error.

DONE.
