  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return err.message || 'Unknown error occurred.';
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only returns a message if the error has a message property, while the mutated code fragment always returns a message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return cb && cb(err.message || 'Unknown error occurred.');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the callback function only if it is defined, while the mutated code fragment calls the callback function regardless of its definition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return cb && cb(err.message || 'Unknown error occurred.') || prompt('Unknown error occurred.');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback function if it is defined, while the mutated code fragment calls the callback function and also displays a prompt if the callback function is not defined.

DONE.
