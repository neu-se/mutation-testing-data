  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type(rule[0]) === 'RegExp' && rule[0].test(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` method is used to check if the word matches the regular expression, whereas the original code fragment uses the `match` method to check if the word matches the regular expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type(rule[0]) === 'RegExp' && rule[0].exec(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `exec` method is used to check if the word matches the regular expression, whereas the original code fragment uses the `test` method to check if the word matches the regular expression.
