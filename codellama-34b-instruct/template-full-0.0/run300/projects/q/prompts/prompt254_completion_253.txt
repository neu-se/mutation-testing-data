  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
message.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the `message` array starting from the second element, instead of the entire array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
message.concat(["new element"])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate a new element to the `message` array, changing its length and content.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
message.filter(function(element) { return element !== "new element"; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would filter out any elements in the `message` array that are equal to the string "new element", potentially changing its length and content.

DONE.
