  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isStopIteration(exception) && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&& false` would always result in `false`, causing the `if` block to be skipped, even if `isStopIteration(exception)` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isStopIteration(exception) || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `|| true` would always result in `true`, causing the `if` block to be executed, even if `isStopIteration(exception)` is `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isStopIteration(exception) ^ true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `^ true` would flip the result of `isStopIteration(exception)`, causing the `if` block to be executed if `isStopIteration(exception)` is `false`, and skipped if `isStopIteration(exception)` is `true`.
