Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly signal that the stream should continue processing, even when an error has occurred, potentially leading to unexpected results or infinite loops.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` would not indicate a proper abort condition, which could cause the stream to continue processing when it should not, leading to incorrect handling of the stream's state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because passing a numeric value instead of a boolean would confuse the logic of the `nextStream` function, potentially causing it to misinterpret the abort signal and continue processing incorrectly.

DONE.
