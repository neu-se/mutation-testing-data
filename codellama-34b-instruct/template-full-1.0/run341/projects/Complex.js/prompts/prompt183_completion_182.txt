  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for equality with 0, whereas this new code checks for greater than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for equality with 0, whereas this new code checks for less than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks the imaginary part of the complex number, whereas this new code checks the real part of the complex number.

DONE.
