  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the fragment identifier from the URL, while the new code fragment would leave it in place.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'?'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the query string from the URL, while the new code fragment would leave it in place.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#' + encodeURIComponent(str)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the fragment identifier from the URL, while the new code fragment would encode it and add it back to the URL.

DONE.
