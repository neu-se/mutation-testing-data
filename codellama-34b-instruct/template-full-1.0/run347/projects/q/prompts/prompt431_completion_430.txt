  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.status === "rejected" 
```
This would result in a different behavior because the `inspect()` method of a promise returns an object with a `state` property, which can be either `"fulfilled"` or `"rejected"`, but does not have a `status` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.fulfilledStatus === "rejected"
```
This would result in a different behavior because the object returned by the `inspect()` method of a promise does not have a `fulfilledStatus` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.rejectedStatus === "rejected"
```
This would result in a different behavior because the object returned by the `inspect()` method of a promise does not have a `rejectedStatus` property.

DONE.
