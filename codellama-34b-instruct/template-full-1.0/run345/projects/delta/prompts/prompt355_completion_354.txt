  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof arg == 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a Delta object instead of a number, which would break the code that depends on this function returning a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof arg === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a string instead of a number, which would break the code that depends on this function returning a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof arg != 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a value that is not a number, which would break the code that depends on this function returning a number.

DONE.
