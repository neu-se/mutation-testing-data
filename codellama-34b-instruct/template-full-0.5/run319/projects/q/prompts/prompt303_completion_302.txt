  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = 10, len = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would not iterate over the `answerPs` array, and the `Q.race` function would not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = 0, len = -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate over the `answerPs` array in reverse order, and the `Q.race` function would be called with a negative length, which could cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = 0, len = answerPs.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate over the `answerPs` array in reverse order, and the `Q.race` function would be called with a length that is one less than the original length.

DONE.
