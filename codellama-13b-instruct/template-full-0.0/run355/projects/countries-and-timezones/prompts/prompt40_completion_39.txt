  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(data.countries).reduce((prev, id) => {
  return <PLACEHOLDER>(prev, { [id]: getCountry(id, options) });
}, {});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getAllCountries` function to return an object with the country IDs as keys and the country objects as values, rather than an array of country objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(data.countries).reduce((prev, id) => {
  return <PLACEHOLDER>(prev, { [id]: getCountry(id, options) });
