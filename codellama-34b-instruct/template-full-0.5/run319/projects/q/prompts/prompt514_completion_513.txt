  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function is called with the argument `1`, which would cause the `defer` function to return a rejected promise with the reason `TypeError: Cannot read property 'runAfter' of undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function is called with the argument `null`, which would cause the `defer` function to return a rejected promise with the reason `TypeError: Cannot read property 'runAfter' of null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function is called with the argument `undefined`, which would cause the `defer` function to return a rejected promise with the reason `TypeError: Cannot read property 'runAfter' of undefined`.

DONE.
