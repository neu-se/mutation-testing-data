  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `a[key]`, which would cause the `isEqual` function to return `false` even if the values are equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the value of `b[key]` to `a[key]`, which would cause the `isEqual` function to return `false` if the values are not equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the value of `a[key]`, which would cause the `isEqual` function to return `false` even if the values are equal.

DONE.
