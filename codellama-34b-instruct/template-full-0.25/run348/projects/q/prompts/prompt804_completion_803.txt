  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `progressed` function to be called with `null` as the first argument, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, undefined, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `progressed` function to be called with `undefined` as the first argument, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, void 0, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `progressed` function to be called with `void 0` as the first argument, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
