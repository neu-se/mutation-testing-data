  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href, baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because the `href` and `baseUrlStr` variables are not defined in the current scope.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href, currentUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because the `currentUrlStr` variable is not defined in the current scope.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href, parsedUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parsedUrl.host` property is not defined in the current scope.

DONE.
