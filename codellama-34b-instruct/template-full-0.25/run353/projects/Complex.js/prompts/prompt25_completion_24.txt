  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 - b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `+` operator, while this replacement code fragment is using the `-` operator. This would cause the final result to be different, potentially leading to incorrect calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `+` operator, while this replacement code fragment is using the `-` operator. This would cause the final result to be different, potentially leading to incorrect calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `+` operator, while this replacement code fragment is using the `*` operator. This would cause the final result to be different, potentially leading to incorrect calculations.

DONE.
