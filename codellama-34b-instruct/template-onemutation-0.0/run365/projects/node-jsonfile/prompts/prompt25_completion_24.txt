  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `content` variable directly, while the new code fragment uses the `toUpperCase()` method to convert the content to uppercase. This could cause the test suite to fail if it is not expecting the content to be in uppercase.
