  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.isFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the promise is fulfilled, but it would not actually resolve the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.isRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the promise is rejected, but it would not actually reject the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the promise is not resolved, but it would not actually resolve the promise.

DONE.
