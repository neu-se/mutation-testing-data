  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the result of `iter.hasNext()`, causing the loop to continue even if there are no more elements to iterate over.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasNext() && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would cause the loop to continue only if both `iter.hasNext()` and `false` are truthy, which would never be the case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasNext() || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would cause the loop to continue if either `iter.hasNext()` or `true` are truthy, which would always be the case.

DONE.
