  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === undefined || a === null || a === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would only check if `a` is `undefined` or `null`, while this new code fragment also checks if `a` is `0`. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === undefined || a === null || a === NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would only check if `a` is `undefined` or `null`, while this new code fragment also checks if `a` is `NaN`. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === undefined || a === null || a === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would only check if `a` is `undefined` or `null`, while this new code fragment also checks if `a` is
