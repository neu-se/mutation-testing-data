  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!rule.clone
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` instead of cloning the rule object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the cloned rule object instead of simply cloning it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(undefined, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a shallow clone of the rule object instead of a deep clone.

DONE.
