Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly increase the length of the operation being processed, potentially causing the transformation logic to skip or incorrectly handle operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reduce the length of the operation being processed, which could lead to incorrect retention or insertion of operations, affecting the final transformed Delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the length of the operation being processed, which could lead to unintended consequences in how operations are retained or inserted, potentially causing data loss or corruption in the transformed Delta.

DONE.
