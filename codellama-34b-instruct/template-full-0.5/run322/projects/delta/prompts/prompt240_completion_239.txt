  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter` is an iterator for the `other` Delta, while `thisIter` is an iterator for the `this` Delta. Using `otherIter.peekLength()` would cause the code to operate on the wrong Delta, which could result in incorrect behavior or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to operate on one more character than it should. This could result in incorrect behavior or errors if the code is not designed to handle this extra character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to operate on one fewer character than it should. This could result in incorrect behavior or errors if the code is not designed to handle this missing character.
