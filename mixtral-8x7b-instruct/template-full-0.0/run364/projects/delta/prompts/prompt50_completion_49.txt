 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'b' + Object.keys(b)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it concatenates the string 'b' with the first key of the object `b`, instead of just using the first key as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it always assigns `null` as the embed type, which might cause issues when the actual embed type is expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Math.random() > 0.5 ? 'a' : 'c'
```
This would result in different behavior because it randomly assigns either 'a' or 'c' as the embed type, instead of using the consistent embed type from the input objects. This could lead to unexpected behavior when specific embed types are expected.

DONE.
