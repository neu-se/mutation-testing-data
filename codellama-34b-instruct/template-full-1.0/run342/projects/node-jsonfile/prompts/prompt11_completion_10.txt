  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER in the code with a buggy code fragment that has different behavior:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 'dummy'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator is applied to the `data` object, which is not a valid operation. The code would throw an error because `data` is an object, but `dummy` is a string, and the two cannot be concatenated using the `+` operator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator is applied to the `data` object, which is not a valid operation. The code would throw an error because `data` is an object, and the `-` operator cannot be applied to an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `data` object is being accessed using the bracket notation
