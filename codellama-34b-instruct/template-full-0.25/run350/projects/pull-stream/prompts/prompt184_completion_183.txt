  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb(null, array[i++])` would return the next element in the array, while the new code fragment `cb(null, null)` would return `null` for every element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(array[i++], null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb(null, array[i++])` would return `null` for every element, while the new code fragment `cb(array[i++], null)` would return the next element in the array followed by `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i--])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb(null, array[i++])` would return the next element in the array, while the new code fragment `cb(null, array[i--])`
