  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(null)` is a resolved promise with a value of `null`, whereas `callback` is a function that may or may not return a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(undefined)` is a resolved promise with a value of `undefined`, whereas `callback` is a function that may or may not return a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(1)` is a resolved promise with a value of `1`, whereas `callback` is a function that may or may not return a promise.

DONE.
