 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
line.indexOf('node') === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks for the string 'node' in the stack line, which may not accurately identify Node.js frames.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!Array.isArray(line) && line
