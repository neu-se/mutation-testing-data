  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at 1 instead of 0, potentially skipping the first element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at -1 instead of 0, potentially causing an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never start, as Infinity is not a valid array index.

DONE.
