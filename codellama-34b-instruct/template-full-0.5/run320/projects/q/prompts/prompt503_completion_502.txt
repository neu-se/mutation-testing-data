  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args, void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the arguments passed to the `apply` method, which could potentially cause issues if the function being called expects the arguments in a specific order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, args
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the first argument to the `apply` method, which could potentially cause issues if the function being called expects a non-null value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0], args
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the first element of the `args` array as the first argument to the `apply` method, which could potentially cause issues if the function being called expects a different value.

DONE.
