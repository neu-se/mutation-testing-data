  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is not the same as the `once` method, and it would cause the `close` method to be called immediately, rather than waiting for the `'drain'` event to be emitted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.on('drain', () => this.close());
```
This would result in different behavior because the `on` method is not the same as the `once` method, and it would cause the `close` method to be called every time the `'drain'` event is emitted, rather than just once.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.once('drain', () => this.close());
```
This would result in different behavior because the `once` method is not the same as the `on` method, and it would cause the `close` method to be called only once, when the `'drain'` event
