  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone.call({})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new instance of the `rule` object, rather than cloning the original object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone["call"]({})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `call` method of the `rule` object, passing an empty object as the `this` context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone.apply({})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `apply` method of the `rule` object, passing an empty object as the `this` context.

DONE.
