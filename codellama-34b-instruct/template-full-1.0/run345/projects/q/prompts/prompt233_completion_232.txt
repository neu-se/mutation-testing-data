  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.otherMethod.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherMethod` is not a method of `resolvedPromise`, so it would throw a `TypeError` when called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejectedPromise.promiseDispatch.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejectedPromise` is not the same as `resolvedPromise`, so it would not have the same `promiseDispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressPromise.promiseDispatch.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `progressPromise` is not the same as `resolvedPromise`, so it would not have the same `promiseDispatch` method.

DONE.
