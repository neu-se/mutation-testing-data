  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype.slice` expects an array as its `this` value, but `arguments` is not an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.slice.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype.slice` expects an array as its `this` value, but `this` is not an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.slice.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype.slice` expects an array as its `this` value, but `null` is not an array.

DONE.
