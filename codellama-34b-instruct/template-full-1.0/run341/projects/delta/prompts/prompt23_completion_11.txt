  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the value of `key` in `b` to the value of `key` in `a`, whereas the original code fragment compares the value of `key` in `a` to the value of `key` in `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the value of `key` in `a` to the value of `key` in `b` plus 1, whereas the original code fragment compares the value of `key` in `a` to the value of `key` in `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] && b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the value of `key` in `a` to the value of `key` in `b`, and return `true` if both values are
