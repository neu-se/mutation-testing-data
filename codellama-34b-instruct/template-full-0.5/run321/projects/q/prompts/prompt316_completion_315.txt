  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect !== void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect !== void 0` is always truthy, whereas `inspect === void 0` is only truthy when `inspect` is `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect === null` is only truthy when `inspect` is `null`, whereas `inspect === void 0` is only truthy when `inspect` is `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect === 0` is only truthy when `inspect` is `0`, whereas `inspect === void 0` is only truthy when `inspect` is `undefined`.

DONE.
