  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'hello'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be pushing a string instead of an operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1234
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be pushing a number instead of an operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be throwing an error instead of pushing an operation.

DONE.
