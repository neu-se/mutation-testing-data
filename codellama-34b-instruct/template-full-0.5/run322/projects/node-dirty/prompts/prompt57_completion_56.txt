  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain', () => this.close()
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be called with a different `this` context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain', () => this.emit('drain')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` method would not be called, which could cause the stream to remain open indefinitely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain', () => this.emit('close')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` event would be emitted, which could cause the stream to be closed prematurely.

DONE.
