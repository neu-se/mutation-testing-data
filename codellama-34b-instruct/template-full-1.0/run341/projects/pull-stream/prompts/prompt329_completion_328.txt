  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + data
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would pass the original `data` value unmodified, while the modified code fragment would add 1 to the `data` value and pass the result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op > 0 ? data : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would pass the original `data` value unmodified if `op` is true, while the modified code fragment would pass `null` if `op` is true but is not a boolean value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op && data.filter(function(x) { return x != null })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would pass the original `data` value unmodified if `op` is true, while the modified code fragment would pass a filtered version of `data` if `op` is true and is a function.

DONE.
