  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice`'s output is reversed, which would change the order of the `nodeArgs` argument when the function is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice`'s output no longer includes the last element, which would change the `nodeArgs` argument when the function is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice`'s output no longer includes the first element, which would change the `nodeArgs` argument when the function is called.

DONE.
