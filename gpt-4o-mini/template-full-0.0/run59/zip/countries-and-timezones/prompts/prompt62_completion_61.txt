Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'unknown'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a country with the id 'unknown', which likely does not exist in the data, leading to a failure in retrieving the correct country information.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id + '1'
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the country id by appending '1' to it, which would cause the function to look for a non-existent country, resulting in incorrect or null country data being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.countries[id]
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly accesses the country data from the data object instead of using the memoization logic, potentially bypassing the caching mechanism and leading to performance issues or incorrect data retrieval if the country is not properly structured in the data.

DONE.
