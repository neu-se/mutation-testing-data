  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `b` variable, which is a complex number, while the replaced code fragment uses the negative of `b`, which is also a complex number but with a different magnitude and phase.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `b` variable, which is a complex number, while the replaced code fragment uses twice the value of `b`, which is also a complex number but with a different magnitude and phase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `b` variable, which is a complex number, while the replaced code fragment uses the sum of `b` and 1, which is also a complex number but with a different magnitude and phase.

DONE.
