  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.unshift(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the new operation at the beginning of the operations array, rather than the end.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delete this.ops[index - 1];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last operation from the operations array, rather than insert a new one at the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[index - 1] = newOp;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the last operation in the operations array with the new operation, rather than inserting it at the end.

DONE.
