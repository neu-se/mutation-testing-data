Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'gooses'
```
This would result in different behavior because the plural form of "goose" is "geese," but this change incorrectly suggests that the plural is "gooses," which is not a valid pluralization.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goat'
```
This would result in different behavior because "goat" does not have a specific pluralization rule defined in the code, and it would default to adding 's', resulting in "goats" instead of the intended "geese."

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goosey'
```
This would result in different behavior because "goosey" is not the correct singular form for which the plural is "geese," leading to an incorrect pluralization that would not match the intended behavior of the function.

DONE.
