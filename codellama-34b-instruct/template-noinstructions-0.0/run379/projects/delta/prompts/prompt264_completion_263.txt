  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.attributes, otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` function to compare the attributes of the two operations, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert, otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` function to compare the insert values of the two operations, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain, otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` function to compare the retain values of the two operations, which may not be the desired behavior.

DONE.
