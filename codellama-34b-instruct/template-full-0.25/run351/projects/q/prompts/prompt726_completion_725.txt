  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
snapshot.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` function would return a rejected promise if any of the promises in the array are rejected, rather than a promise for an array of values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
snapshot.state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` function would return a pending promise if any of the promises in the array are pending, rather than a promise for an array of values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
snapshot.state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` function would return a fulfilled promise if any of the promises in the array are fulfilled, rather than a promise for an array of values.

DONE.
