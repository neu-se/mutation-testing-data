  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a` variable is not modified in the original code, but it is modified in the mutated code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b` variable is not used in the original code, but it is used in the mutated code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a` and `b` variables are not combined in the original code, but they are combined in the mutated code.

DONE.
