 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the last two characters of the word instead of the correct number of characters from the end.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the last character of the word instead of the correct number of characters from the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(Math.random() * w.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a random number of characters from the end of the word instead of the correct number.

DONE.
