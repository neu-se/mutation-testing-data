  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'http://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only replaces the protocol if it is not already present, while the mutated code fragment always adds the "http://" protocol, which could cause the URL to be parsed incorrectly.
