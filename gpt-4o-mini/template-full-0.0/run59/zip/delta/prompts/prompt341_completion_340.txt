Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new OpIterator(slice.ops).peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek()` retrieves the next operation without advancing the iterator, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the operation in subsequent logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new OpIterator(slice.ops).next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because calling `next(1)` retrieves only one operation, which may not be sufficient if the original code expects to handle multiple operations at once, leading to incomplete processing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new OpIterator(slice.ops).next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because calling `next(0)` effectively does nothing and returns an empty operation, which would disrupt the expected flow of operations and could lead to unexpected results in the inversion logic.

DONE.
