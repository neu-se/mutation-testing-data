 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback.apply(thisp)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver());` line is not being called, so the callback will not receive the resolved value or error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback.call(thisp, null, deferred)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver());` line is being replaced with `nodeArgs.push(deferred);`, so the callback will receive the `deferred` object instead of the actual resolved value or error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback.call(null, deferred)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thisp` argument is not being passed to the callback, and the `nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver());` line is being replaced with `nodeArgs.push(de
