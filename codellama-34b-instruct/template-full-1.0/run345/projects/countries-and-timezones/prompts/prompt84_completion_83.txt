  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `getCountry(...)` returns `null` if the country with the provided ID does not exist, whereas the original code fragment returns the first country in the `countries` list.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `getCountry(...)` returns `undefined` if the country with the provided ID does not exist, whereas the original code fragment returns the first country in the `countries` list.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because `getCountry(...)` returns an empty array if the country with the provided ID does not exist, whereas the original code fragment returns the first country in the `countries` list.

DONE.
