  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Q can't join: not the same: " + x + " " + y);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws an error if `x` and `y` are not the same, while this replacement code fragment would throw an error regardless of whether `x` and `y` are the same or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(x).join(y);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a rejected promise with a specific error message if `x` and `y` are not the same, while this replacement code fragment would return a rejected promise with a different error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(y).join(x);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a rejected promise with a specific error message if `x` and `y` are not the same, while this replacement code fragment would
