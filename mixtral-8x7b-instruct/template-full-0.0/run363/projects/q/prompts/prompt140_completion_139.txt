 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p ? 1 : 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `p` is truthy, while the modified code always returns 1 if `p` is defined and 0 otherwise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!p.source
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not access any property of `p`, while the modified code checks if `p` has a `source` property and negates its value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p instanceof Error
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `p` is truthy, while the modified code checks if `p` is an instance of `Error`.

DONE.
