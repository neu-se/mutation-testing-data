  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.delete + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` property would be incremented by 1, which could cause the code to behave differently when dealing with deletions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.delete - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` property would be decremented by 1, which could cause the code to behave differently when dealing with deletions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.delete * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` property would be multiplied by 2, which could cause the code to behave differently when dealing with deletions.

DONE.
