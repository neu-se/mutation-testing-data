  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(noop, noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the value `undefined`, rather than the original value of `promise`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(noop, noop).then(noop, noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the value `undefined`, rather than the original value of `promise`. Additionally, it would create an additional promise that would be resolved with the value `undefined`, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(noop, noop).then(noop, noop).then(noop, noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the value `undefined`, rather than the original value of `promise`. Additionally, it would create
