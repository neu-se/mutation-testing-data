  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would be called with `undefined` as the value, which would overwrite the existing property with `undefined`, whereas the original code would delete the property entirely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would be called with `null` as the value, which would overwrite the existing property with `null`, whereas the original code would delete the property entirely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key, ""]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would be called with an empty string as the value, which would overwrite the existing property with an empty string, whereas the original code would delete the property entirely.

DONE.
