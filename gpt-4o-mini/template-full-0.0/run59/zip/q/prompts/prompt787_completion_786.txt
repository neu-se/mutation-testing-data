Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately resolve the promise with the given object, bypassing any rejection handling that was intended in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the promise to be rejected with the given object, regardless of whether the original promise was fulfilled or not, leading to a different flow in promise handling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(rejected)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the promise chain to only handle the rejection case, ignoring the fulfillment case entirely, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

DONE.
