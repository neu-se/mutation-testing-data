  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (; index < length; index++) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would run indefinitely, causing the program to hang.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (; index <= length; index++) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, potentially causing an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (; index < length - 1; index++) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip the last element in the array, potentially causing an error.

DONE.
