  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\b(?:bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep)\b/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex pattern is now anchored to the start of the string using the `^` operator, which would cause the pattern to only match words that are at the beginning of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(?:bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep)\b/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex pattern no longer uses the `\b` word boundary assertion, which would cause the pattern to match words that are not followed by a word boundary.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(?:bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep)\b/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex pattern now uses case-
