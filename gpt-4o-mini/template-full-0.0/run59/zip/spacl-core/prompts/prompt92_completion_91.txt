Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const policy of policies.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it skips the first policy in the array, potentially omitting a valid policy from being added to the `PolicyMap`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const policy in policies)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a `for...in` loop, which iterates over the indices of the array instead of the policy objects themselves, leading to incorrect behavior when trying to access `policy.name`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const policy of policies) if (policy.active) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a condition to only add policies that are marked as active, potentially excluding inactive policies from being added to the `PolicyMap`.

DONE.
