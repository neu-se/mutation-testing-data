  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.timezones
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezonesMap` function would return a different object than the original code, which would cause the `buildCountry` function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.countries
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezonesMap` function would return a different object than the original code, which would cause the `buildCountry` function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.timezones[id]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezonesMap` function would return a different object than the original code, which would cause the `buildCountry` function to return a different result.

DONE.
