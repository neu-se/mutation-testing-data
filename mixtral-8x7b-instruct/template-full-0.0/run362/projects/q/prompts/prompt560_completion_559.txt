 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because in the SpiderMonkey generator case, it would always consider the exception as an instance of `StopIteration`, even if it's not, and resolve the promise with the exception value instead of rejecting it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new StopIteration()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new `StopIteration` object, which might not have the same properties as the original exception object, and could cause the continuation to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always treat the exception as not an instance of `StopIteration`, and reject the promise with the exception instead of resolving it with the exception value.

DONE.
