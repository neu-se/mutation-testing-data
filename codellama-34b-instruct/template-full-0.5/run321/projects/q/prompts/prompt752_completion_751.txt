  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an instance of `Error`, and therefore would not be caught by the `catch` block.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("Different error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different from the original, and therefore would not be caught by the `catch` block.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not an instance of `Error`, and therefore would not be caught by the `catch` block.

DONE.
