Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.includes('//')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the presence of the substring `'//'` instead of using a regex match, potentially allowing invalid paths that contain empty segments to pass through without throwing an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\/\//g)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the global flag `g`, which returns an array of matches instead of a single match or `null`. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the code relies on the result being `null` for no matches.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\/\//i)
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the case-insensitive flag `i`, which is unnecessary for this regex and could lead to confusion, although it would not change the matching behavior in this specific case.

DONE.
