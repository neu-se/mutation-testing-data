  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value is not a function, and therefore cannot be called with the `()` operator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value is not a function, and therefore cannot be called with the `()` operator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `true` value is not a function, and therefore cannot be called with the `()` operator.

DONE.
