  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Hello, world!"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return the string "Hello, world!" regardless of the arguments passed to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return the number 42 regardless of the arguments passed to it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return null regardless of the arguments passed to it.

DONE.
