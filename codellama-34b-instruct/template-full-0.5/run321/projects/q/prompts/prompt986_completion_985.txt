  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because `post` is a method that sends a request to a server to create or update a resource, while `get` is a method that sends a request to a server to retrieve a resource.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete"
```
This would result in different behavior because `post` is a method that sends a request to a server to create or update a resource, while `delete` is a method that sends a request to a server to delete a resource.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"put"
```
This would result in different behavior because `post` is a method that sends a request to a server to create or update a resource, while `put` is a method that sends a request to a server to update a resource.

DONE.
