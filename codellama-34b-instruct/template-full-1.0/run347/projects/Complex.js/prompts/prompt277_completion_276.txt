  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in the method always returning 0, regardless of the input parameters, which would be a different behavior than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in the method always returning 1, regardless of the input parameters, which would be a different behavior than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in the method always returning NaN (Not a Number), regardless of the input parameters, which would be a different behavior than the original code.

DONE.
