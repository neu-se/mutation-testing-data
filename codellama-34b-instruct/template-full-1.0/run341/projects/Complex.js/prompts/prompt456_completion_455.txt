  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `Math.sqrt(Complex['EPSILON'])`
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a constant, `Complex['EPSILON']` for the absolute difference between `a` and `b`, while this code uses the square root of that constant. This would cause the code to be more sensitive to small differences in `a` and `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `-this['re'] - this['im']`
This would result in different behavior because the original code subtracts the imaginary part from the real part, while this code subtracts the real part from the imaginary part. This would cause the code to return the complex conjugate instead of the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `Complex.prototype.ceil.call(this, places)`
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls the `ceil` function on the `Complex` object directly, while this code uses the prototype chain to call the same function. This would cause the
