  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Object.keys()` method returns the keys of an object, and `a` is an object in this case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because `b[key]` is a property access expression, and it would return the value of the property `key` in the object `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [key]: b[key] }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new object with a single property `key`, and the value of that property would be the value of the property `key` in the object `b`.

DONE.
