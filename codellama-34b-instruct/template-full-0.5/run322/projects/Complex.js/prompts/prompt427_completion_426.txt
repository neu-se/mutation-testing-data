  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would divide by zero, which would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would divide by a negative number, which would result in a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would divide by infinity, which would result in NaN (Not a Number).

DONE.
