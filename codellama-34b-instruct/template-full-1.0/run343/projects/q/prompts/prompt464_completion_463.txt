  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promiseA
```
This would result in different behavior because `promiseA` is a different promise than the original `promise`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejection` is a different object than the original `promise`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(promise)` creates a new Q promise that is different than the original `promise`.

DONE.
