  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ }
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty options object would be passed to the `getTimezone` function, which would cause the function to return a timezone with a different name than the one expected in the test.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ deprecated: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezone` function would return a deprecated timezone, which would cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezone` function would return `null`, which would cause the test to fail.

DONE.
