  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, and it would not have the same properties or methods as the original `reason` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object, and it would not have the same properties or methods as the original `reason` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because `new Error()` creates a new error object, and it would not have the same properties or methods as the original `reason` object.

DONE.
