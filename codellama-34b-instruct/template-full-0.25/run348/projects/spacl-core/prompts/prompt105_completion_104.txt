  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the `name` variable to lowercase, which could cause the `get()` method to return a different value than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method would return a substring of the `name` variable, starting from the second character. This could cause the `get()` method to return a different value than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method would split the `name` variable into an array of characters, the `reverse()` method would reverse the order of the characters, and the `join()` method would join the characters back into a string. This could cause the `get()` method to return a different value than expected.

DONE.
