Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the starting index for slicing the arguments array, potentially omitting the first argument when calling the dispatched function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it evaluates to `2`, which would incorrectly include the first two arguments instead of just the arguments starting from the second one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the length of the `args` array as the starting index, which could lead to an empty array being passed to the dispatched function if `args` is empty.

DONE.
