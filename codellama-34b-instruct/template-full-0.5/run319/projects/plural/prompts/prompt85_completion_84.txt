  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mouse', 'mouses'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the plural function to return the incorrect plural form for the word "mouse".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mice', 'mice'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the plural function to return the same value for both the singular and plural forms of the word "mouse".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'monkey', 'monkeys'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the plural function to return the incorrect plural form for the word "monkey".

DONE.
