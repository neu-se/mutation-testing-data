  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```a < b```
This would result in different behavior because  The code would produce incorrect results if `a` and `b` are not comparable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```a > b```
This would result in different behavior because  The code would produce incorrect results if `a` and `b` are not comparable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```a != b```
This would result in different behavior because  The code would produce incorrect results if `a` and `b` are not comparable.

DONE.
