  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).npost(name, args).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is not defined on the `npost` method, so the code would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).npost(name, args).then(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is not defined on the `npost` method, so the code would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).npost(name, args).catch(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch` method is not defined on the `npost` method, so the code would throw an error.

DONE.
