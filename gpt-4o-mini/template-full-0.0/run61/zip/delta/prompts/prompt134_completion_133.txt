Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp = iter.next(end - index + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly retrieves one extra operation than intended, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds error or incorrect slicing of operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp = iter.next(start - index + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it retrieves an operation based on an incorrect calculation, which could cause the wrong operation to be pushed into the `ops` array, altering the expected output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp = iter.next(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it always retrieves the first operation regardless of the current index, which would lead to incorrect results when slicing the operations.

DONE.
