Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the `object` into a resolved promise, bypassing the intended dispatch mechanism and potentially leading to incorrect handling of the callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately reject the promise with the `object`, causing the promise chain to fail instead of dispatching the method call as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat `object` as a promise and not invoke the `dispatch` method, which would prevent the intended method call from being executed.

DONE.
