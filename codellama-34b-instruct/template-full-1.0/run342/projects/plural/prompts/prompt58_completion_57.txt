  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('criterion')
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `addRule` is called with only one argument, which would cause an error as it expects two arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('criterion', 'criterions')
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the `addRule` function is changed from `criteria` to `criterions`, which would cause the pluralization function to return the incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(null, 'criteria')
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument of the `addRule` function is changed from the expected regular expression to `null`, which would cause the function to return the incorrect result.

DONE.
