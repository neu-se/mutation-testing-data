  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, cbs] = this._queue.shift();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `for...of` loop to iterate over the `this._queue` object, while this replacement code uses the `shift()` method to remove the first element of the queue and assign it to the `key` and `cbs` variables. This could potentially cause the loop to skip over some elements in the queue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, cbs] = this._queue.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `for...of` loop to iterate over the `this._queue` object, while this replacement code uses the `pop()` method to remove the last element of the queue and assign it to the `key` and `cbs` variables. This could potentially cause the loop to skip over some elements in the queue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
