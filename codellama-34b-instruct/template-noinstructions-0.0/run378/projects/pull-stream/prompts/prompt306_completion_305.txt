  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = !end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the value of `end`, which could cause the function to terminate early or continue running indefinitely, depending on the value of `end`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the value of `end` to `ended`, which could cause the function to terminate early or continue running indefinitely, depending on the value of `end`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = !ended
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the value of `ended`, which could cause the function to terminate early or continue running indefinitely, depending on the value of `ended`.

DONE.
