Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.has(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the existence of the key in the `_data` map instead of retrieving its value, which would lead to incorrect handling of data when writing to the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the value associated with the key to `null` instead of retrieving the actual value, which could lead to data loss or corruption in the `_data` map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key) + ' modified'
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends the string ' modified' to the value retrieved from `_data`, altering the data being written to the stream and potentially causing issues with data integrity.

DONE.
