  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/\//.test(spec)
```
This would result in different behavior because `test` returns a boolean value indicating whether the pattern matches the input string, while the original code fragment uses `match` to return the matches.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/\//g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the pattern makes it match all occurrences in the input string, while the original code fragment only matches the first occurrence.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/\/.*/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.*` at the end of the pattern matches any character (except for line terminators) zero or more times, while the original code fragment only matches the first character after the slash.

DONE.
