Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it compares the new operation's attributes to the last operation's attributes instead of the new operation's attributes, potentially leading to incorrect merging of operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to false in the equality check, causing the merging logic to be skipped entirely, which could lead to unexpected results in the operations array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also always evaluate to false in the equality check, similar to using `null`, thus preventing any merging of operations based on attributes, which could disrupt the intended functionality of the `push` method.

DONE.
