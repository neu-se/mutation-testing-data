  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trackUnhandledRejections` variable is set to `true` by default, and the `!` operator would invert the value to `false`. This would cause the `trackRejection` function to be called every time a rejection is created, regardless of whether it is handled or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process !== "object" || typeof process.emit !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process` object is only checked for the `emit` function if it is an object. If `process` is not an object, the `typeof` operator would return `"undefined"` and the `||` operator would evaluate to `true`, causing the `trackRejection` function to be called every time a rejection is created, regardless of whether it is handled or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.
