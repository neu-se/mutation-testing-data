  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the not operator (!) to check if the name is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if the name is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the not operator (!) to check if the name is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if the name is an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.toLowerCase() === 'null'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the not operator (!) to check if the name is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if the name is the string 'null'.

DONE.
