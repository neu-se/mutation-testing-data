  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op]()
```
This would result in different behavior because `descriptor[op]` is a function and `descriptor[op]()` would call the function, while `descriptor[op].apply` would return a reference to the function without calling it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op].bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `descriptor[op].bind(null)` would create a new function that, when called, would call `descriptor[op]` with a `this` value of `null`, while `descriptor[op].apply` would call `descriptor[op]` with a `this` value of `promise`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op].call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `descriptor[op].call(null)` would call `descriptor[op]` with a `this` value of `null`, while
