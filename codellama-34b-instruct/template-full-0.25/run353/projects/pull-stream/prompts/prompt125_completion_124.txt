  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is now being incremented before being returned, which could cause the function to return a different value than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is now being decremented before being returned, which could cause the function to return a different value than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max - end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `max` variable is now being subtracted from `end` before being returned, which could cause the function to return a different value than expected.

DONE.
