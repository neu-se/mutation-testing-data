  Sure, I can help you with that.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * -1
```
This would result in different behavior because `b * -1` is the negative of `b`, so the resulting vector would have an angle of -π instead of π.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a * b` is the dot product of `a` and `b`, which would give a different length and direction of the resulting vector.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a + b` would give a larger length and a different direction of the resulting vector.

DONE.
