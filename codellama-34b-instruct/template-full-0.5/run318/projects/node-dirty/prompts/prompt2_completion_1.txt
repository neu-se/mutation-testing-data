  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, val);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method is called on the `this._data` map, which is not defined in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method is called on the `this._data` map, which is not defined in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.get(key);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method is called on the `this._queue` map, which is not defined in the original code.

DONE.
