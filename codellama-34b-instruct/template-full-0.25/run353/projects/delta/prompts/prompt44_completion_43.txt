  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a !== 'object' || a === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the code to proceed even if `a` is not an object, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a !== 'object' && a !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prevent the code from proceeding if `a` is not an object, which could cause the code to fail to execute correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== null && typeof a === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the code to proceed only if `a` is not null and is an object, which could cause the code to fail to execute correctly if `a` is null or not an object.

DONE.
