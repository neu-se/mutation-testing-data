 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a boolean `true` instead of `null` as the first argument to the callback function, which could cause the calling code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `data` variable instead of `null` as the first argument to the callback function, which could cause the calling code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Unexpected end of input')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error instead of passing `null` as the first argument to the callback function, which could cause the calling code to handle the error instead of continuing with the next iteration.

DONE.
