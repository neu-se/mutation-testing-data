  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, !data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the `data` value, which would cause the `op` function to be called with a different argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would add 1 to the `data` value, which would cause the `op` function to be called with a different argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.length` property would return the length of the `data` array, which would cause the `op` function to be called with a different argument.

DONE.
