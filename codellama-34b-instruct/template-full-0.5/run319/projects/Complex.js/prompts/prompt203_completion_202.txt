  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp(b)` would return the exponential of `b`, rather than the exponential of `a + i*b` as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(a, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.pow(a, b)` would return the value of `a` raised to the power of `b`, rather than the exponential of `a + i*b` as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp(a + b)` would return the exponential of `a + b`, rather than the exponential of `a + i*b` as intended.

DONE.
