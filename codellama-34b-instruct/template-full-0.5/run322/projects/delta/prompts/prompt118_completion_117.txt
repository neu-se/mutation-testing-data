  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of `Op` is a number, and adding 1 to it would change the value of the expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of `Op` is a number, and subtracting 1 from it would change the value of the expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of `Op` is a number, and multiplying it by 2 would change the value of the expression.

DONE.
