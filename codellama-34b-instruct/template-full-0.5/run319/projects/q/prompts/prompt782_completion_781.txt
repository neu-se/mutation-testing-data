  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
regardless, regardless, regardless
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `onRejected` function to be called multiple times, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
regardless, regardless, regardless, regardless
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `onRejected` function to be called an additional time, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
regardless, regardless, regardless, regardless, regardless
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `onRejected` function to be called an additional time, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
