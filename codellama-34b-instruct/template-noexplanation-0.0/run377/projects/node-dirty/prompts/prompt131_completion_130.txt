  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data
```
This change will cause the code to iterate over the `this._data` object instead of the `this._queue` object, which may cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size()
```
This change will cause the code to iterate over the number of elements in the `this._queue` object, which may cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.isEmpty()
```
This change will cause the code to iterate over the `this._queue` object only if it is empty, which may cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
