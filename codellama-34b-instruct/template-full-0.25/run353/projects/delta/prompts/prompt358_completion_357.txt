  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!priority
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `priority`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `priority` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
priority + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `priority` is `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
priority - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `priority` is `true`.

DONE.
