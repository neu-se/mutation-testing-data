Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of rejecting the promise with an error, it would resolve the promise, potentially leading to incorrect handling of errors in the calling code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject("An error occurred")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with a specific error message instead of the original error, which could change how the error is handled downstream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Custom error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with a new custom error object instead of the original error, which could affect how the error is caught and processed in the calling code.

DONE.
