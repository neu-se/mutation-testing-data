  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(0)` creates a shallow copy of the `nodeArgs` array, which may cause the `nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver())` line to fail if the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function returns a value that is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat()` creates a new array that is a concatenation of the `nodeArgs` array and any additional arguments passed to it. This could cause the `nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver())` line to fail if the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function returns a value that is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.splice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice(0)` removes all elements from the `nodeArgs
