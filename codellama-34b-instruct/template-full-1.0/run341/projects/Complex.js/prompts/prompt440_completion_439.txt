  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` always rounds down to the nearest integer, whereas `Math.ceil` always rounds up to the nearest integer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.round` always rounds to the nearest integer, whereas `Math.floor` always rounds down and `Math.ceil` always rounds up.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random` returns a random integer between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive), whereas `Math.floor`, `Math.ceil`, and `Math.round` always return consistent results based on the given input.

DONE.
