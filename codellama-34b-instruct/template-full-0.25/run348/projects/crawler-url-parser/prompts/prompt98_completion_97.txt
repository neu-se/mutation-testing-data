  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.has(currentUrl.url) && urlMap.get(currentUrl.url).text != text
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the URL is already in the map and if the text associated with it is different from the current text.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.has(currentUrl.url) || urlMap.get(currentUrl.url).text != text
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the URL is already in the map or if the text associated with it is different from the current text.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!urlMap.has(currentUrl.url) && urlMap.get(currentUrl.url).text != text
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the URL is not already in the map and if the text associated with it is different from the current text.

DONE.
