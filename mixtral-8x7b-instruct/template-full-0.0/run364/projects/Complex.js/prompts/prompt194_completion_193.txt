 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
b, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the exponentiation formula for purely imaginary numbers uses `b` in the calculation, and setting it to 0 would change the result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
a, z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the exponentiation formula for purely imaginary numbers uses `b` in the calculation, and replacing it with `a` would change the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
z['im'], z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the exponentiation formula for purely imaginary numbers uses `b` in the calculation, and replacing `b` with `z['im']` would change the result.

By making these changes, the test suite may fail, indicating that the tests are not effectively covering the edge cases related to the exponentiation of purely imaginary numbers. DONE.
