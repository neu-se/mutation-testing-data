  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `onUnhandledError` would be called with a `null` context, which could cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError.bind(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `onUnhandledError` would be called with an `undefined` context, which could cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `onUnhandledError` would be called with the current context, which could cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
