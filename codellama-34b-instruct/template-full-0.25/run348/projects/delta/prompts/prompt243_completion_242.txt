  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would start the loop from the last operation instead of the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would start the loop from the last operation and then try to access an operation that doesn't exist, causing an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would start the loop from the last operation and then try to access an operation that doesn't exist, causing an error.

DONE.
