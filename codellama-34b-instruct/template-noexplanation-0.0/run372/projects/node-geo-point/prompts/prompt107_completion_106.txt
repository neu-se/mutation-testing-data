  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(2, zoom)
```
This code fragment is a function call to the `Math.pow()` function, which calculates the value of a number raised to a power. In this case, it raises 2 to the power of `zoom`, which is a variable that represents the zoom level of a map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(2, zoom + 1)
```
This code fragment is similar to the previous one, but it adds 1 to the power of `zoom`. This can be useful if you want to calculate the tile coordinates for a higher zoom level than the current one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(2, zoom - 1)
```
This code fragment is similar to the previous one, but it subtracts 1 from the power of `zoom`. This can be useful if you want to calculate the tile coordinates for a lower zoom level than the current one.
