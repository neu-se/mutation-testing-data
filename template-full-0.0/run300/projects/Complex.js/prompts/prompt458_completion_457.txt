  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` checks if the number is not a number, while `isInfinite` checks if the number is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` checks if the number is finite, while `isInfinite` checks if the number is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `!` negates the result of `isInfinite`, so the resulting behavior would be the opposite of the original code.

DONE.
