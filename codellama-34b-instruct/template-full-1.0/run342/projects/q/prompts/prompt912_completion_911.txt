  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `array_slice` call does not specify a starting index, while the new call starting at the second argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `array_slice` call returns an array of the function's arguments, while `Object.keys` returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property names.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `slice` method on the `Array` prototype, instead of the `array_slice` function, which could potentially return a different result if the `slice` method is overwritten.

DONE.
