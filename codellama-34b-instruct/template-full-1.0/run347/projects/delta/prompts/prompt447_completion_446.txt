```
null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `this.ops` to be an array, and `null` is not an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index + 1];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects to retrieve the current operation at index `this.index`, but the new code would retrieve the next operation at index `this.index + 1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index] = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `this.ops[this.index]` to be an operation object, but the new code would set it to `null`.

DONE.
