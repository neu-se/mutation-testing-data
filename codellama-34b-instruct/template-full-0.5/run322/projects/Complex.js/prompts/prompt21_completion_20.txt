  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a + b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.sqrt` function to calculate the square root of `a * a + b * b`, which is not the same as multiplying `a * a + b * b` by itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.sqrt` function to calculate the square root of `a * a + b * b`, which is not the same as multiplying `a` and `b` together.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.sqrt` function to calculate the square root of `a * a + b * b`, which is not the same as adding `a` and `b` together.

DONE.
