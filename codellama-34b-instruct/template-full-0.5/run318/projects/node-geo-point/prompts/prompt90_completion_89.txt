  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(θ) * sin(δ) * cosφ1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the sine of the angle between the two points, rather than the angle itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(θ) * sin(δ) * cosφ1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the cosine of the angle between the two points, rather than the angle itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan(θ) * sin(δ) * cosφ1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the tangent of the angle between the two points, rather than the angle itself.

DONE.
