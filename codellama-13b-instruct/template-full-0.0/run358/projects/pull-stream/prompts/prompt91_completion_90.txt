  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function would now be called with `undefined` as an argument, which may cause it to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function would now be called with `null` as an argument, which may cause it to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function would now be called with `0` as an argument, which may cause it to return a different result.

DONE.
