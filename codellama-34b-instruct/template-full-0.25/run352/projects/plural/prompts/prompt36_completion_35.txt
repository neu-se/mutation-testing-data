  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1, w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring starting from index 1 would be one character shorter than the original substring starting from index 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1, w.length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring starting from index w.length - 1 would be one character shorter than the original substring starting from index 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 2, w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring starting from index w.length - 2 would be one character shorter than the original substring starting from index 0.

DONE.
