  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, w.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the entire word, instead of the last letter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, w.length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the entire word, except for the last two letters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, w.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the entire word, plus an extra letter.

DONE.
