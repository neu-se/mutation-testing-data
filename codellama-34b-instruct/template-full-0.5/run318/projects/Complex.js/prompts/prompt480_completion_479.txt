  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isInfinite` method to be called instead of the `isNaN` method, which could lead to different results in the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `im` property to be used instead of the `re` property, which could lead to different results in the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `EPSILON` constant to be used instead of the `re` property, which could lead to different results in the calculation.

DONE.
