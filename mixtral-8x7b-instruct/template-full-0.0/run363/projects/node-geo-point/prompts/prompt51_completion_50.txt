 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
point2['longitude'] - point1['longitude']
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the properties using bracket notation, which can behave differently in certain edge cases compared to dot notation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Math.abs(point2.longitude) - Math.abs(point1.longitude)
