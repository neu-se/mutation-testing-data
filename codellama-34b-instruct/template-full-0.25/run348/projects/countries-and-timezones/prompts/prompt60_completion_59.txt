  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `buildCountry` function with the `data` object and the `id` variable, which would return a new country object, rather than using the memoized country object from the `countries` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `buildCountry` function with the `data` object and the `id + 1` variable, which would return a new country object with a different `id` property, rather than using the memoized country object from the `countries` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `buildCountry` function with the `data` object and the `id - 1` variable, which would return a new
