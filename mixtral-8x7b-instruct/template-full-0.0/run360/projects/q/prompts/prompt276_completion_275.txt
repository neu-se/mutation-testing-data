 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject(<PLACEHOLDER>)` call would reject the promise with `null` instead of an error object, which might cause issues in the code that consumes this rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
42
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject(<PLACEHOLDER>)` call would reject the promise with the value `42` instead of an error object, which might cause issues in the code that consumes this rejected promise, as it would not be able to properly handle the non-error value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Error('User-defined error')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject(<PLACEHOLDER>)` call would reject the promise with a user-defined error object instead of the original error object, which might
