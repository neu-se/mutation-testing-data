  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `callback` could be a function that returns `null`, which would cause the `apply` method to be called on `null`, leading to an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `callback` could be a function that returns `undefined`, which would cause the `apply` method to be called on `undefined`, leading to an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback !== null && callback !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would ensure that `callback` is not `null` or `undefined`, which would prevent the `apply` method from being called on `null` or `undefined`, avoiding errors.

DONE.
