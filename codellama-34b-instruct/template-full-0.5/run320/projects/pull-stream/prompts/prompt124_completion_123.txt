  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i--)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the `i` variable instead of incrementing it, which could cause the function to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, Math.random())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a random number instead of the incremented `i` variable, which could cause the function to return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the incremented `i` variable plus one, which could cause the function to return incorrect results.

DONE.
