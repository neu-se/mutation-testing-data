  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the imaginary part of the complex number by 2 instead of the real part, which is what the original code does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the imaginary part of the complex number from the real part, instead of multiplying the real part by 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * Math.cos(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the cosine of the real part of the complex number by 2, instead of multiplying the real part by 2.

DONE.
