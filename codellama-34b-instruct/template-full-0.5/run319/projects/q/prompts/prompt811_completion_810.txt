  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finally` block would not be executed, as `null` is a falsy value and would not be passed to the `then` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finally` block would not be executed, as `undefined` is a falsy value and would not be passed to the `then` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finally` block would not be executed, as `false` is a falsy value and would not be passed to the `then` method.

DONE.
