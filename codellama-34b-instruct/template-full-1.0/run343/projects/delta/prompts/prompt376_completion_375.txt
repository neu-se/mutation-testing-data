  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would flip the condition, potentially allowing the `if` statement to execute when it shouldn't.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the condition to check if the next op is a retain, potentially causing the `if` statement to execute when it shouldn't.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the condition to check if the next op is a delete, potentially causing the `if` statement to execute when it shouldn't.

DONE.
