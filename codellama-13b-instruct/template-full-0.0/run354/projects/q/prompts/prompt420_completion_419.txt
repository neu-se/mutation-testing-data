  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect().state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the promise is fulfilled, while the new code fragment checks if the promise is fulfilled and the state is "fulfilled".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect().state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the promise is fulfilled, while the new code fragment checks if the promise is rejected and the state is "rejected".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect().state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the promise is fulfilled, while the new code fragment checks if the promise is pending and the state is "pending".

DONE.
