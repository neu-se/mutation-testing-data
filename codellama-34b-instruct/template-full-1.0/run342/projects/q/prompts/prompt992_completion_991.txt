  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the method would expect 3 arguments, but the original code expects 2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs
```
This would result in different behavior because the method would receive the `nodeArgs` array instead of the `arguments` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because the method would receive the `deferred` object instead of the `arguments` object.

DONE.
