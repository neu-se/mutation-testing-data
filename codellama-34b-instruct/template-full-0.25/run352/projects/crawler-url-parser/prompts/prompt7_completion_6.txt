  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr && !_has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the result of the `_has_illegal_chars` function, causing the code to behave as if the `baseUrlStr` did not have any illegal characters, even if it did.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr && _has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr) && false
```

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr && _has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr) || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `|| true` would cause the expression to always evaluate to `true`, regardless of the result of the `_has
