  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, {}, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `predicate` function would be called with an empty `attributes` object, which may not be what the developer intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, null, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `predicate` function would be called with a `null` `attributes` object, which may not be what the developer intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, undefined, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `predicate` function would be called with an `undefined` `attributes` object, which may not be what the developer intended.

DONE.
