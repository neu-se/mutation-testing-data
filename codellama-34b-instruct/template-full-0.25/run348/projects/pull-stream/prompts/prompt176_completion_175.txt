  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` function would be called on the `length` property of the `array` object, rather than the `array` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return a new array containing the elements of the original `array`, rather than the original `array` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.filter(function(x) { return x !== undefined })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method would return a new array containing only the elements of the original `array` that are not `undefined`, rather than the original `array` object.

DONE.
