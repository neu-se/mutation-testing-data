Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compute the cosine of `a` instead of the sine, leading to incorrect results for the tangent calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(a + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compute the sine of `a + 1`, which is not the same as the sine of `a`, thus altering the output of the tangent function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(a) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the sine value of `a`, which would incorrectly scale the result of the tangent calculation, leading to erroneous outputs.

DONE.
