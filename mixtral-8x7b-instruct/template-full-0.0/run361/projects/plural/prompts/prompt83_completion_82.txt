 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'mice'
```
This would result in different behavior because the rule for adding "es" to words ending in "o" would be triggered, changing "mouse" to "mouses".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'mice'
```
This would result in different behavior because the rule for singular nouns that end in "s" would be triggered, and the word would remain "mouse".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'mouce'
```
This would result in different behavior because the rule for adding "s" to the end of a word would be triggered, changing "mouce" to "mouces".

DONE.
