  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a function that resolves the promise with a value, whereas `reject` is a function that rejects the promise with a reason. Using `resolve` instead of `reject` would cause the promise to be fulfilled instead of rejected, which would result in different behavior.

DONE.
