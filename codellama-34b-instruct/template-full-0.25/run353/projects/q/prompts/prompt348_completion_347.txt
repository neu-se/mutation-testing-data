  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<rejected>(exception, self);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function would be called with the wrong arguments, which could cause the promise to be resolved instead of rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<rejected>(exception, self, true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function would be called with an additional argument, which could cause it to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<rejected>(exception, self, false);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function would be called with a different argument, which could cause it to behave differently.

DONE.
