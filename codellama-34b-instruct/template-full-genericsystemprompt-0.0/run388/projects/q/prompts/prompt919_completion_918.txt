  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is not defined on the `deferred` object, so it would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(deferred.promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method expects a promise as its argument, but `deferred.promise` is not a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(Q.resolve(deferred.promise))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method expects a promise as its argument, but `Q.resolve(deferred.promise)` is not a promise.

DONE.
