  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\n" + STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR + "\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the stack trace to be printed twice, once for the original error and once for the new error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the stack trace to be printed on a new line, rather than being concatenated with the original stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the stack trace to be completely removed, rather than being concatenated with the original stack trace.

DONE.
