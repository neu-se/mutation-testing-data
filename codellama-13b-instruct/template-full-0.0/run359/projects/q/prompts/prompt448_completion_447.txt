  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.push(promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the promise to the `unhandledRejections` array, which would cause the `unhandledRejection` event to be emitted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.unshift(promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the promise to the beginning of the `unhandledRejections` array, which would cause the `unhandledRejection` event to be emitted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.splice(0, 0, promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the promise to the beginning of the `unhandledRejections` array, which would cause the `unhandledRejection` event to be emitted.

DONE.
