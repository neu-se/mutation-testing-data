  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at 10 instead of 0, and would iterate over a different set of elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at -1 instead of 0, and would iterate over a different set of elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = array.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at the last index of the array instead of the first, and would iterate over the elements in reverse order.

DONE.
