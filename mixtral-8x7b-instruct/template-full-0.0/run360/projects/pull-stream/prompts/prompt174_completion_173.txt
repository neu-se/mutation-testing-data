 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a number instead of the array itself, causing the `Array.isArray` check to always fail and potentially skipping the iteration over the array elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(array)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first key-value pair of the object, potentially causing the iteration to only process one element or fail if the object is empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
global.array
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reference the global `array` variable instead of the local one, potentially causing unexpected behavior if a global variable with the same name exists or is defined later in the code.

DONE.
