  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']() && z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when both `this` and `z` are zero, regardless of whether they are infinite or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when either `this` or `z` is infinite, regardless of whether they are zero or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when `this` is zero and `z` is infinite, regardless of whether they are zero or not.

DONE.
