  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isObject(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the input is an object, but this modified code checks if the input is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty('latitude') && !object.hasOwnProperty('longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the input has both latitude and longitude properties, but this modified code checks if the input has a latitude property but not a longitude property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.latitude === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the input has a latitude property, but this modified code checks if the input has a latitude property that is undefined.

DONE.
