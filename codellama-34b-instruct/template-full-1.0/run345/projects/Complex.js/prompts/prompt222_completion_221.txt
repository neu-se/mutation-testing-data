  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because now the `sqrt` method is computing the square root of the sum of the real and imaginary parts, instead of the absolute value of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] - this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because now the `sqrt` method is computing the square root of the difference between the real and imaginary parts, instead of the absolute value of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(this['re']) + Math.abs(this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because now the `sqrt` method is computing the square root of the sum of the absolute values of the real and imaginary parts, instead of the absolute value of the complex number.

DONE.
