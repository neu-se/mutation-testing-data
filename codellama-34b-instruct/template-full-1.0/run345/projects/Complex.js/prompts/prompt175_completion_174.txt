  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c < d
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code keeps both sides of the equation within the domain of real numbers, while the new code would cause an error for any value of `c` and `d` that results in a negative number under the square root. 

Option 2: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(d) < Math.abs(c)
```
This would result in a different behavior because it would treat positive and negative numbers differently when calculating the square root.

Option 3: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(c) != Math.abs(d)
```
This would result in a different behavior because it would cause the equation to result in `true` for any values of `c` and `d` that are not equal in magnitude, while the original code would only result in `true` when the absolute value of `c` is less than the absolute value of `d`.

DONE.
