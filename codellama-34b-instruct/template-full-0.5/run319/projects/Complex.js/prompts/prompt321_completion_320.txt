  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Math.cos` to calculate the cosine of the angle, but replacing it with `-Math.sin` would calculate the sine of the angle instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Math.cos` to calculate the cosine of the angle, but replacing it with `Math.tan` would calculate the tangent of the angle instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Math.cos` to calculate the cosine of the angle, but replacing it with `Math.acos` would calculate the inverse cosine of the angle instead.

DONE.
