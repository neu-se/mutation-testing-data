  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (let key in a) {
  if (a[key] !== undefined && b[key] === undefined) {
    attributes[key] = a[key];
  }
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the for loop would still iterate over the properties of `a`, but the loop variable `key` would be overridden with the current iteration of `a`, causing the condition `a[key] !== undefined` to always be true and the assignment `attributes[key] = a[key];` to be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (let key in b) {
  if (a[key] !== undefined && b[key] === undefined) {
    attributes[key] = a[key];
  }
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the for loop would iterate over the properties of `b` instead of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
