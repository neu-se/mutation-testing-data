  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the unary minus operator, which negates the value of `x`, while the replacement code fragment uses the binary minus operator, which subtracts `x` from the value of `x`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the unary minus operator, which negates the value of `x`, while the replacement code fragment uses the binary multiplication operator, which multiplies `x` by `-1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x - x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the unary minus operator, which negates the value of `x`, while the replacement code fragment uses the binary subtraction operator, which subtracts `x` from `x`.

DONE.
