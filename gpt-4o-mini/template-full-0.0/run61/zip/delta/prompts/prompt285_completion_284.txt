Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always start searching for the newline character from the beginning of the string, potentially missing any newline characters that occur later in the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the index based on the length of the current insert operation, which could lead to incorrect indexing when searching for the newline character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would offset the index by one more than the current length, which could cause the search for the newline character to go out of bounds or skip the first character in the string.

DONE.
