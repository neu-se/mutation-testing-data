  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestPortTick()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `requestPortTick` function immediately, rather than in the next event loop iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(requestPortTick, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would schedule the `requestPortTick` function to be called after at least 1ms, rather than in the next event loop iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setImmediate(requestPortTick)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would schedule the `requestPortTick` function to be called after the current execution context, rather than in the next event loop iteration.

DONE.
