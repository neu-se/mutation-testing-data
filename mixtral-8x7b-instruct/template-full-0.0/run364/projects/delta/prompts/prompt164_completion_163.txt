 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prioritize insert operations over delete operations, which could cause unexpected results in the `compose` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peekLength() > 0
