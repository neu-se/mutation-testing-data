  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q - 1` would return a promise that is one less than the original `Q` promise, which would cause the `inspect` method to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q + 1` would return a promise that is one more than the original `Q` promise, which would cause the `inspect` method to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q * 2` would return a promise that is twice the value of the original `Q` promise, which would cause the `inspect` method to return a different value.

DONE.
