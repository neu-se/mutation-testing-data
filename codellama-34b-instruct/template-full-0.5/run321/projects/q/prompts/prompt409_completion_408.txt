  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!value
```
This would result in different behavior because the logical not operator `!` would negate the value, causing the if statement to evaluate to the opposite branch.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value would be incremented, causing the if statement to evaluate to the opposite branch.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value * 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the value would be multiplied by zero, causing the if statement to evaluate to the opposite branch.

DONE.
