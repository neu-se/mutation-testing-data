  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` would call the `cb` function, while the new code fragment `abort` would return the `abort` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` would call the `cb` function, while the new code fragment `null` would return `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` would call the `cb` function, while the new code fragment `undefined` would return `undefined`.

DONE.
