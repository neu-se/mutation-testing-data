  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would cause the `nextOp` variable to be `undefined`, which would lead to errors in the code that uses it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would cause the `nextOp` variable to be `null`, which would lead to errors in the code that uses it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `NaN` value would cause the `nextOp` variable to be a number, but not a valid number, which could lead to errors in the code that uses it.

DONE.
