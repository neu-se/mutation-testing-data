  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking for the existence of the `insert` property, while this modified fragment is checking for its absence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking for the existence of an insert operation, while this modified fragment is checking for the existence of an insert operation with attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking for the existence of an insert operation, while this modified fragment is checking for the existence of a retain operation.

DONE.
