  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the result of the `query` method, effectively flipping the boolean value returned by the method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the result of the `query` method, effectively flipping the boolean value returned by the method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the result of the `query` method is null, effectively changing the return value of the method.

DONE.
