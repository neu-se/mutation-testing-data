  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex, "__esModule", { 'value': false }
```
This would result in different behavior because the ES module "__esModule" would be set to false, which could cause issues with module imports and exports.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex, "__esModule", { 'value': NaN }
```
This would result in different behavior because the ES module "__esModule" would be set to NaN, which could cause issues with module imports and exports.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex, "__esModule", { 'value': undefined }
```
This would result in different behavior because the ES module "__esModule" would be set to undefined, which could cause issues with module imports and exports.

DONE.
