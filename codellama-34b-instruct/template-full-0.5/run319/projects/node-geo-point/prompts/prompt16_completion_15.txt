  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fromLngLatArray(point.coordinates.reverse());
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method would flip the order of the coordinates, resulting in a different point being created.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fromLngLatArray(point.coordinates.slice(1));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice(1)` method would remove the first coordinate from the array, resulting in a different point being created.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fromLngLatArray(point.coordinates.concat([0, 0]));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat([0, 0])` method would add two additional coordinates to the end of the array, resulting in a different point being created.

DONE.
