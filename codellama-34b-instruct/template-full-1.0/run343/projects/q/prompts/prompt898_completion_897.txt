  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unshift` method adds new elements to the beginning of an array, whereas `push` adds them to the end. This would likely change the behavior of the `nodeArgs` array and the `Q.makeNodeResolver()` method, which might not be able to handle the new element added to the beginning of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop` method removes and returns the last element of an array. This would likely change the behavior of the `nodeArgs` array and the `Q.makeNodeResolver()` method, which might not be able to handle the missing element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because the `shift` method removes and returns the first element of an array. This would likely change the behavior of the `nodeArgs` array and the
