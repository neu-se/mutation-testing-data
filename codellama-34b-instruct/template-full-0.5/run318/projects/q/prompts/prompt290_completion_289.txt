  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` method is called instead of `reject`, which would cause the promise to be fulfilled instead of rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` method is called with `undefined` instead of a value, which would cause the promise to be fulfilled with a value of `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("test")
```
This would result in different behavior because an error is thrown instead of calling the `resolve` method, which would cause the promise to be rejected with an error.

DONE.
