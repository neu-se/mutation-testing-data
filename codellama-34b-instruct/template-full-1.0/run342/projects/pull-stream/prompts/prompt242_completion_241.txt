  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as the second argument to the callback function, which could cause the test to pass even if the first argument is not `end`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be passed as the first argument to the callback function, which could cause the test to fail even if the second argument is `end`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `data` value would be passed as the second argument to the callback function, which could cause the test to fail even if the first argument is `end`.

DONE.
