Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Fulfillment error");
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of returning the fulfilled value, it throws an error, causing the promise to be rejected immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return null;
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `null` instead of the fulfilled value would change the resolved value of the promise, potentially leading to unexpected results in subsequent `.then()` calls.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Promise.reject(new Error("Rejected value"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the promise to be rejected with a new error instead of resolving with the fulfilled value, which would alter the flow of promise handling in the chain.

DONE.
