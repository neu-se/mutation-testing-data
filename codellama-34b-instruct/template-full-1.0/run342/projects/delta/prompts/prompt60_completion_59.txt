  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because `arg === ''` would return true if `arg` is an empty string, while `typeof arg === 'string' && arg.length === 0` would not return true if `arg` is an empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg === []
```
This would result in different behavior because `arg === []` would return true if `arg` is an empty array, while `typeof arg === 'string' && arg.length === 0` would not return true if `arg` is an empty array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `arg.length === 0` would return true if `arg` has a length of 0, while `typeof arg === 'string' && arg.length === 0` would not return true if `arg` is a non-empty string with a length of
