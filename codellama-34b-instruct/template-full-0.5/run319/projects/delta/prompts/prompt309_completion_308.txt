  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(0)` creates a shallow copy of `line`, which may not be intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(1)` creates a shallow copy of `line` starting from the second element, which may not be intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.slice(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(-1)` creates a shallow copy of `line` starting from the last element, which may not be intended.

DONE.
