  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k in throughs.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method returns a reversed version of the `throughs` object, which would cause the `for` loop to iterate over the properties of the reversed object instead of the original object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k in throughs.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method returns a new array with the elements of the original array from the specified start index (in this case, 1) to the end of the array. This would cause the `for` loop to iterate over a subset of the properties of the `throughs` object, rather than all of them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k in throughs.filter(function(v) { return v.indexOf('s') === 0; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter()` method returns a new array with
