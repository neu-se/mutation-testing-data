  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === false ? null : abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `abort` is `true`, but this replacement checks if it's `false`. If `abort` is `false`, the original code would return `null`, but this replacement would return `abort`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === true ? null : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `abort` is `true`, but this replacement checks if it's `true` and then returns `null` regardless of the value of `abort`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort !== true ? null : abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `abort` is `true`, but this replacement checks if it's not `true` and then returns `null` if it's not. If `abort` is `true`, this replacement
