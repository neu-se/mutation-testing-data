Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the next operation and potentially cause the transformation logic to miss processing an operation, leading to incorrect delta results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not advance the iterator, causing the same operation to be processed multiple times instead of moving to the next operation, which could lead to infinite loops or incorrect transformations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would effectively do nothing (not advance the iterator), which could lead to incorrect handling of the operations and potentially cause the transformation to not reflect the intended changes.

DONE.
