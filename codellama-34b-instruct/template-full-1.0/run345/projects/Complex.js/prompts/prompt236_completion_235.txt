  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (a - r)
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of a and r are flipped, which would change the resulting values of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
4.0 * (r - a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the constant value is different, which would change the resulting values of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r + a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the signs of r and a are added instead of subtracted, which would change the resulting values of the code.

DONE.
