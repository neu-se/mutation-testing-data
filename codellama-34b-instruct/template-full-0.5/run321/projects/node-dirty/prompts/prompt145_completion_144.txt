  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', err);
```
This would result in different behavior because `emit` is not a function, so it would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', this._inFlightWrites);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit the number of in-flight writes, which is not the same as emitting the `'drain'` event.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.emit('drain', err);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit the `'drain'` event on the `_writeStream` object, which is not the same as emitting it on `this`.

DONE.
