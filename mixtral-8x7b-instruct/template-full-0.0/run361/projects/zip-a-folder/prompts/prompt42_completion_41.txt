 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
zipArchive['glob']
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the `glob` property as a string key instead of using the dot notation, which may not be interpreted the same way in all JavaScript environments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
zipArchive.bulk()
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls a non-existent `bulk()` method on the `zipArchive` object, which would throw an error and prevent the function from executing further.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
zipArchive.directory(src, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the second argument of the `directory()` method to `true`, which creates a top-level directory for the contents of the `src` directory. This may not be the desired behavior, as the original code does not create a top-level directory.

DONE.
