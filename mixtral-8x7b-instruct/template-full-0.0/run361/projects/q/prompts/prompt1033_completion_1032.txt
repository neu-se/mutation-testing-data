 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Error("Different error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the type of error object created, which could affect how error handlers process the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the error condition entirely, causing the success handler to be invoked instead of the error handler.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.when(null, function() { throw error; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps the error in a Q promise, which could affect how the error is propagated and handled.

DONE.
