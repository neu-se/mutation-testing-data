  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops
```
This will cause the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function to throw an error, as it expects the `a` and `b` parameters to be objects with a single key, but `ops` is an array of objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops[0]
```
This will cause the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function to throw an error, as it expects the `a` and `b` parameters to be objects with a single key, but `ops[0]` is an object with multiple keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops[0].ops
```
This will cause the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function to throw an error, as it expects the `a` and `b` parameters to be objects with a single key, but `ops[0].ops` is an array of objects.

DONE.
