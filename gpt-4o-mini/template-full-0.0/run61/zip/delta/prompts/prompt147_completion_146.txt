Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the `next` method to always consume one unit, potentially skipping over necessary operations that should be processed, leading to incorrect composition of the `Delta`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it effectively does nothing, as it attempts to consume zero units, which means the current operation will not be advanced, potentially causing an infinite loop or incorrect results in the composition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses the `otherIter` to consume an operation instead of the `thisIter`, which would lead to mixing operations from the two different `Delta` instances, resulting in an invalid composition.

DONE.
