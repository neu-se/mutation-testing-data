  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^(?:http|https):\/\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the protocol from the URL, even if it is already present, whereas the original code fragment would only add the protocol if it is not already present.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:http|https):\/\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only add the protocol if it is already present, whereas the original code fragment would always add it regardless of whether it is already present or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^(?:http|https):\/\//, 'ftp://')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the protocol with the string "ftp://", whereas the original code fragment would only add the protocol if it is not already present.

DONE.
