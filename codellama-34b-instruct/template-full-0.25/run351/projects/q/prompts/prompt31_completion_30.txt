  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.pop(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` expects an index as an argument, but `null` is not a valid index. The original code fragment uses `laterQueue.pop()` without any arguments, which is equivalent to `laterQueue.pop(undefined)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.pop(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` expects an index as an argument, but `undefined` is not a valid index. The original code fragment uses `laterQueue.pop()` without any arguments, which is equivalent to `laterQueue.pop(undefined)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.pop(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` expects an index as an argument, but `0` is not a valid index. The original code fragment uses `laterQueue.pop()` without any arguments, which is equivalent
