  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `return reject(exception, self);`, which passes the `self` argument to the `reject` function, while the new code fragment does not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(new Error(exception));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `return reject(exception);`, which passes the `exception` object directly to the `reject` function, while the new code fragment creates a new `Error` object from the `exception` object and passes that to the `reject` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(exception, self);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `return reject(exception);`, which passes only the `exception` object to the `reject` function, while the new code fragment passes both the `exception` object and the `self` object to
