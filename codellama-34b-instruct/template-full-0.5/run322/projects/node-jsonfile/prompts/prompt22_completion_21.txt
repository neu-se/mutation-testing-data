  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^\ufeff/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stripBom` function is being replaced with a regular expression that removes the UTF-8 byte order mark (BOM) from the beginning of the file, while the original code fragment does not perform any such operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stripBom` function is being replaced with a function that removes the first character of the file, while the original code fragment does not perform any such operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^\ufeff/, '').substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stripBom` function is being replaced with a combination of a regular expression that removes the UTF-8 BOM from the beginning of the file, and a function that removes the first character of the file.

DONE.
