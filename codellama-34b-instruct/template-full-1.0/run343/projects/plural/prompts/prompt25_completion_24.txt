  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substring(0, w.length - 2) + 'i'
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring` starts at the specified position and goes to the end of the string, while `substr` starts at the specified position and extracts the specified number of characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.slice(0, w.length - 2) + 'i'
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` starts at the specified position and extracts the specified number of characters, while `substring` starts at the specified position and goes to the end of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substring(0, w.length - 2) + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra 's' to the end of the word, while the original code fragment only adds an 'i' to the end of the word.

DONE.
