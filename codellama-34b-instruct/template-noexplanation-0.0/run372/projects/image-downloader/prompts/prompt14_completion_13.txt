  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basename.toLowerCase()
```
This change will cause the `decodeURIComponent` function to return a lowercase version of the basename, which may not match the expected filename.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basename.split('.')[0]
```
This change will cause the `decodeURIComponent` function to return only the first part of the basename, which may not include the file extension.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basename.replace('.', '_')
```
This change will cause the `decodeURIComponent` function to replace any periods in the basename with underscores, which may not match the expected filename.

DONE.
