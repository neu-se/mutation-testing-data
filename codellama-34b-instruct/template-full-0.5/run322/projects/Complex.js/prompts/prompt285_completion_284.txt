  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cosh` returns the hyperbolic cosine of a number, while the replacement code fragment `-cosh` returns the negative hyperbolic cosine of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cosh` returns the hyperbolic cosine of a number, while the replacement code fragment `sinh` returns the hyperbolic sine of a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tanh
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cosh` returns the hyperbolic cosine of a number, while the replacement code fragment `tanh` returns the hyperbolic tangent of a number.

DONE.
