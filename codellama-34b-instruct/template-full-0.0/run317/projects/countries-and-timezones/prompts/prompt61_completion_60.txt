  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildCountry` function expects a non-null value for the `data` parameter, and passing `null` would cause the function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildCountry` function expects a defined value for the `data` parameter, and passing `undefined` would cause the function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildCountry` function expects a non-empty object for the `data` parameter, and passing an empty object would cause the function to throw an error.

DONE.
