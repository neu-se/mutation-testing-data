  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (isPromiseAlike(undefined)) {
```
This would result in a syntax error because `isPromiseAlike()` is not defined.

Option 2: The following potential replacement line would result in different behavior because it would check for the constant false, and not the function call as in the original code.
```
if (isPromiseAlike(false)) {
```

Option 3: The following would work but is also not what was need in the example:
```
if (isPromiseAlike(Q.progress(value))) {
```

DONE.
