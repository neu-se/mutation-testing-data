  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match()` method with a boolean argument would always return `null`, causing the subsequent `if` statement to always fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match()` method with a `null` argument would always return `null`, causing the subsequent `if` statement to always fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match()` method with a negative argument would always return `null`, causing the subsequent `if` statement to always fail.

DONE.
