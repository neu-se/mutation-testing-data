  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` is not the same as `a`, and `b` is not defined in the code snippet.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `a + 1` is not the same as `a`, and it would change the result of the `sin` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `a * 2` is not the same as `a`, and it would change the result of the `sin` function.

DONE.
