  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch` would be called with `null`, which would likely cause the code to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch` would be called with `true`, which would likely cause the code to behave differently than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
message
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch` would be called with the `message` variable, which may have a different value than expected.

DONE.
