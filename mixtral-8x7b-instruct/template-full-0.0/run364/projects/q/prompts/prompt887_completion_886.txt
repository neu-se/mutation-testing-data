 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array from the arguments object, excluding the first argument (which is the callback function in the original code). This change would cause the nfcall function to not receive the intended arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.keys(arguments).slice(1)
