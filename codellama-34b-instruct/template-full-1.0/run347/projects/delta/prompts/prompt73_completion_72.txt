  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` is a method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `push` is a method that adds an element to the end of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fill
```
This would result in different behavior because `fill` is a method that fills all the elements of an array from a start index to an end index with a static value, while `push` adds an element to the end of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` is a method that adds or removes elements from an array, while `push` adds an element to the end of an array.

DONE.
