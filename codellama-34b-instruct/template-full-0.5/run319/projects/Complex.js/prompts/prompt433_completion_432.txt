  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be multiplying the real part of the complex number instead of the imaginary part, which would produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be adding 1 to the result of the multiplication, which would produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be multiplying the result of the multiplication by 2, which would produce a different result.

DONE.
