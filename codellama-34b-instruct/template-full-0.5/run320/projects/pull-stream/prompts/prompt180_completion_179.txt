  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` variable is now being incremented, which could cause the `abortCb` function to be called with a different value than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` variable is now being decremented, which could cause the `abortCb` function to be called with a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` variable is now being multiplied by 2, which could cause the `abortCb` function to be called with a different value than the original code.

DONE.
