 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.prototype.toString.call(promises) === '[object Array]'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the object type instead of the length, allowing non-array inputs that have a `length` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
promises.constructor.name === 'Array'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the constructor name instead of the length, allowing non-array inputs that have the same constructor name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.isArray(promises)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Array.isArray()` function, which returns `false` for array-like objects that are not actual arrays, such as arguments objects or DOM node lists.

DONE.
