 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb = null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prevent the `abortCb` function from being called if the async operation is aborted after the `map` function has started processing the data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(aborted)
