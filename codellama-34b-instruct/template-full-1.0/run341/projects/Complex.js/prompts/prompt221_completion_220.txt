  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the sum of `a` and `b`, not the sine of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the difference of `a` and `b`, not the sine of `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2*a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return twice the value of `a` plus `b`, not the sine of `b`.

DONE.
