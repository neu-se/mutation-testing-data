  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the prototype of the promise object, which could affect the behavior of methods that use the prototype chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected immediately, which could affect the behavior of methods that rely on the promise being resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with an error value, which could affect the behavior of methods that rely on the promise being resolved with a specific value.

DONE.
