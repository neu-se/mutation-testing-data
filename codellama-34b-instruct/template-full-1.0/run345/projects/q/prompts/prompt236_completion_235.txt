  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise` is a different object than `resolvedPromise`, and it would not have the same properties and methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.target
```
This would result in different behavior because `target` is a property of the `resolvedPromise` object, and it would not be available under the name `promise`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
una
```
This would result in different behavior because `una` is not a defined variable, and it would cause a ReferenceError.

DONE.
