  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.thenResolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `thenResolve` returns a promise that resolves with the return value of the callback, whereas `then` returns a promise that resolves with the return value of the callback if the callback was not rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.thenReject
```
This would result in different behavior because `thenReject` returns a promise that is rejected with the return value of the callback, whereas `then` returns a promise that resolves with the return value of the callback if the callback was not rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(this).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve(this)` returns a promise that resolves with `this`, whereas `this` might not be a promise.

DONE.
