  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the rule to match even if the context is not undefined, which is not intended. The rule should only match if the context is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ctx === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the rule to match even if the context is not an object, which is not intended. The rule should only match if the context is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the rule to match even if the context is not an array, which is not intended. The rule should only match if the context is an array.

DONE.
