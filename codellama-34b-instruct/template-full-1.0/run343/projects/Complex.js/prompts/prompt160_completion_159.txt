  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation operator `!` would flip the result of the original `isInfinite` check. If the original code was checking if `this` was infinite, the modified code would check if `this` is not infinite, which would result in different behavior when the input parameters are the same.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'] || this['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because the modified code is checking if `this` is either infinite or zero, which would result in different behavior when the input parameters are the same.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex['NAN'].isInfinite()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Complex['NAN'].isInfinite()` is always `false`, regardless of the input parameters. This would cause the modified code to return a different result than the original code when `this`
