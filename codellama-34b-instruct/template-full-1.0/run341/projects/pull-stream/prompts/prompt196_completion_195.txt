  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because `!abort` is the logical negation of `abort`, which means that the condition will be `true` if `abort` is `false`, and `false` if `abort` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && false
```
This would result in different behavior because `abort && false` is an expression that is always `false`. This means that the code inside the `if` statement would never be executed, even if the `aborted` variable is `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const DEBUG = true; abort || DEBUG
```
This would result in different behavior because `abort || DEBUG` is an expression that is always `true` if `abort` is `false` or `true`. This means that the code inside the `if` statement would always be executed, regardless of the value of `aborted`.
