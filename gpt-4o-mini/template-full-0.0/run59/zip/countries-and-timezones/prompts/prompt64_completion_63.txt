Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return countries[id] ? { ...countries[id], timezones: [] } : null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns an empty array for timezones, regardless of the actual timezones associated with the country, potentially leading to incorrect data being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deliverCountry(countries[id], { deprecated: true });
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the function to always return the country with the `deprecated` flag set to true, which may not reflect the actual state of the country data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return countries[id] ? { ...countries[id], timezones: countries[id].allTimezones } : null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly assigns the `allTimezones` property to the returned object instead of the `timezones` property, which could lead to confusion and incorrect usage of the returned data.

DONE.
