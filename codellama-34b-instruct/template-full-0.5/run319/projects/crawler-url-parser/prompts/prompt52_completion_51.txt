  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because `parsedUrl.pathname` is a different property than `parsedUrl`, which is the object returned by `URL.parse()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.searchParams
```
This would result in different behavior because `parsedUrl.searchParams` is a different property than `parsedUrl`, which is the object returned by `URL.parse()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.href
```
This would result in different behavior because `parsedUrl.href` is a different property than `parsedUrl`, which is the object returned by `URL.parse()`.

DONE.
