  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!op
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the boolean value of `op`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `op` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add `1` to the value of `op`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` if `op` is less than `1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would multiply the value of `op` by `2`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` if `op` is less than `2`.

DONE.
