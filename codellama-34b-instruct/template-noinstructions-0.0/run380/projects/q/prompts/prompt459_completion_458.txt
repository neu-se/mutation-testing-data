  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the length of the `unhandledRejections` array instead of checking if the `promise` is in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the length of the `promise` object instead of checking if the `promise` is in the `unhandledRejections` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.indexOf(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the index of the `promise` in the `unhandledRejections` array instead of checking if the `promise` is in the array.

DONE.
