  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/.*@(.+):(\d+):(\d+)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment would match the filename, line number, and column number, while the original code fragment only matched the filename and line number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/.+@(.+):(\d+)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment would match any character before the @ symbol, while the original code fragment only matched any character before the @ symbol if it was followed by a colon.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/.*@(.+):(\d+).*/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment would match any character before the @ symbol and any character after the line number, while the original code fragment only matched any character before the @ symbol and the line number.

DONE.
