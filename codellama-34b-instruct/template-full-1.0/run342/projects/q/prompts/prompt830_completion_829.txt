  Sure, I can help you with that!

Here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER in the given code:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `fail` method to be called on the `Promise` object itself, rather than on a separate `Q` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `fail` method to be called on the `Q` object, rather than on the `Promise` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `fail` method to be called on a resolved `Promise` object, rather than on a rejected one.

DONE.
