 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q(object).catch(() => {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch` method would swallow any rejections, preventing them from being propagated or handled by the calling code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the input promise with a new promise that is immediately resolved with a value of `null`. This could lead to unexpected behavior in the calling code, especially if it relies on the original promise's value or rejection reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q(object).spread(() => {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spread` method expects an array or a promise for an array as its argument, and it assumes that the input promise will be fulfilled with an array. Using `spread` without an array argument would result in an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
