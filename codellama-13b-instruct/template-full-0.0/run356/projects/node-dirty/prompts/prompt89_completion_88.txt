  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `rowStr` is an empty string, while the new code fragment checks if `rowStr` has a length of 0. This could potentially cause different behavior if the input data contains empty strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!rowStr.trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `rowStr` is an empty string, while the new code fragment checks if `rowStr` has a length of 0 after trimming whitespace. This could potentially cause different behavior if the input data contains whitespace-only strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `rowStr` is an empty string, while the new code fragment checks if `rowStr` is an empty string after trimming whitespace. This could potentially cause different behavior if the input
