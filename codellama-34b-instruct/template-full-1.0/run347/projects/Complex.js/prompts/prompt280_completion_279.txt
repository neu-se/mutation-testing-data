  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the expression would be different, which could potentially cause incorrect calculations or comparisons.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the expression would be different, which could potentially cause incorrect calculations or comparisons.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a ^ 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the expression would be different, which could potentially cause incorrect calculations or comparisons.

DONE.
