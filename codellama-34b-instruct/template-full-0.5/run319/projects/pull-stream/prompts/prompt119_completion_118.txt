  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is not called, and the `acc` variable is not updated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is not called, and the `acc` variable is not updated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is called with the `end` argument set to `true`, which is not the expected behavior.

DONE.
