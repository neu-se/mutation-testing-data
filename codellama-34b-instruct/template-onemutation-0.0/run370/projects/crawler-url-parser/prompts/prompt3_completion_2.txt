  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof currentUrlStr === 'null'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `currentUrlStr` is undefined, but this new code fragment checks if `currentUrlStr` is null. If `currentUrlStr` is null, the original code fragment would return null, but this new code fragment would return a different value.

DONE.
