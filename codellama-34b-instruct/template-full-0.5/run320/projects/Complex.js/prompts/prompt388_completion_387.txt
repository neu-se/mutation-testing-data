  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the complex cosh, while the replaced code fragment calculates the complex sech.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the complex cosh, while the replaced code fragment calculates the complex coth.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the complex cosh, while the replaced code fragment calculates the complex acoth.

DONE.
