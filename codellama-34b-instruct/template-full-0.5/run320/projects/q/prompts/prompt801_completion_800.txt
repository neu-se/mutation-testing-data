  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `progress` function to return `undefined` instead of the `promise` object, which would break the chain of promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `progress` function to throw an error instead of returning the `promise` object, which would break the chain of promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return promise.then(function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `progress` function to return a new promise that is resolved with the value of the original `promise`, which would break the chain of promises.

DONE.
