 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with the `this` value set to a specific object. In this case, it might cause issues if the method `dispatch` relies on accessing variables or methods from the parent scope.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.dispatch.call(null)
