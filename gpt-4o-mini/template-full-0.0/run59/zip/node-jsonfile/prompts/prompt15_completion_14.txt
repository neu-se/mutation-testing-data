Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the function used to wrap the `_readFile` function from a promise-based approach to a callback-based approach, which may lead to different error handling and asynchronous behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the original promise-returning function with a resolved promise, which would not execute the `_readFile` logic and would immediately return `undefined`, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromPromise(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes `null` to `fromPromise`, which would likely cause an error when trying to invoke the resulting function, as it would not be a valid function to call.

DONE.
