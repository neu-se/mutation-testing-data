  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude * Math.PI / 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the `coordinate.latitude` property would be replaced with `coordinate.longitude`, which could cause the function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 180 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would add one unit of measurement to the final result, which could cause the function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 180 * 0.99
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 0.99` would reduce the result by 1%, which could cause the function to return a different result.

DONE.
