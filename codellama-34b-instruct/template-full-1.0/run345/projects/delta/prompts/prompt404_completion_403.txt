  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the index of the current operation, regardless of whether it is a delete or retain operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.length()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the total length of the other delta, regardless of whether it is a delete or retain operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the number of operations in the other delta, regardless of whether they are delete or retain operations.

DONE.
