  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] - this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is comparing the real parts of the two complex numbers, whereas this change would compare the imaginary parts.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] * this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is subtracting the real parts of the two complex numbers, whereas this change would multiply them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] * this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is comparing the real parts of the two complex numbers, whereas this change would compare the products of their imaginary parts.

DONE.
