  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (!end || end === true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false` when `end` is `null`, whereas the original code would evaluate to `true` in that case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (end !== true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true` when `end` is `null`, whereas the original code would evaluate to `false` in that case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (end !== null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true` when `end` is `null`, whereas the original code would evaluate to `false` in that case.

DONE.
