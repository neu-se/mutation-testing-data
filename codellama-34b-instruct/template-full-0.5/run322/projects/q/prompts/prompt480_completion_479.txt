  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` removes the first element of the array, whereas `splice` removes a specific element at a given index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes the last element of the array, whereas `splice` removes a specific element at a given index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.slice(at, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` returns a new array containing the elements from the original array starting at the given index, whereas `splice` removes the specified element from the original array.

DONE.
