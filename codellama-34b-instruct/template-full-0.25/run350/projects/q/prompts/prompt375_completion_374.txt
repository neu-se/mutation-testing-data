  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
threw
```
This would result in different behavior because `threw` is always truthy, so the `if` statement would always be entered, even if the callback did not throw an exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!threw
```
This would result in different behavior because `!threw` is always falsy, so the `if` statement would never be entered, even if the callback did throw an exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
threw === true
```
This would result in different behavior because `threw === true` is only true if the callback threw an exception, so the `if` statement would only be entered if the callback threw an exception.

DONE.
