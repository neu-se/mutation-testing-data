  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > b && a > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only evaluate to true when `a` is greater than `b` and `a` is greater than zero, rather than when `b` is equal to zero and `a` is greater than zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0 && b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only evaluate to true when `a` is greater than zero and `b` is equal to zero, rather than when `b` is equal to zero and `a` is greater than zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a > 0 && b === 0) || (a < 0 && b === 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only evaluate to true when `a` is greater than zero and `b` is equal to zero, or when `a` is less than zero and `b
