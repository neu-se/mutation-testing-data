  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.throws
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.throws` is a boolean value that indicates whether the function should throw an error when it encounters a problem, whereas `options` is an object that contains various options for the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.encoding` is a string value that indicates the encoding of the file, whereas `options` is an object that contains various options for the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.reviver
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.reviver` is a function that is called with each key and value in the JSON data, whereas `options` is an object that contains various options for the function.

DONE.
