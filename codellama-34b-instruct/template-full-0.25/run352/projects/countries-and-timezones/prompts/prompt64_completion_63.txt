  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(countries[id], options);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deliverCountry` function is not being called, and the `countries` object is not being passed to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(timezones[name], options);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deliverTimezones` function is not being called, and the `timezones` object is not being passed to it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(countries[id].timezones, options);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deliverCountry` function is not being called, and the `countries` object is not being passed to it.

DONE.
