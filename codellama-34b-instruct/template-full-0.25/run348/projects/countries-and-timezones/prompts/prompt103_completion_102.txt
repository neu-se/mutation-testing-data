  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev + tzs[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would concatenate the `prev` object with the `tzs[key]` object, rather than assigning the `tzs[key]` object to the `prev` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `prev` object would be assigned to the `key` property of the `tzs` object, rather than the `tzs` object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev[key] = tzs[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `prev` object would be assigned to the `key` property of the `tzs` object, rather than the `tzs` object itself, and the `tzs[key]` object would be assigned to the `prev` object.

DONE.
