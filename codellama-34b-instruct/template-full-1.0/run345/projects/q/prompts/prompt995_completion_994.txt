  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` adds the argument to the end of the array, while `unshift` adds it to the beginning. This would cause the callback to be passed as the first argument instead of the last argument, which could break the function's behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` mutates the original array, while `concat` creates a new array. This could cause the function to return a different result or throw an error if it relies on the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function() { functionToApply(nodeArgs); })()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the function immediately, rather than passing it as an argument. This could break the function's behavior if it expects the function to be called later.

DONE.
