Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Parsing error");
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of calling `parser_exit()`, which presumably handles the error gracefully, this code throws an error that may not be caught, potentially crashing the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return { 're': NaN, 'im': NaN };
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of exiting the parser, this code returns a complex number with both real and imaginary parts set to NaN, which could lead to further calculations being performed on invalid data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("Invalid input detected");
```
This would result in different behavior because it logs a message to the console instead of terminating the parsing process, allowing the program to continue running even with invalid input, which may lead to unexpected results later in the execution.

DONE.
