  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream
```
This change will cause the function to enter an infinite loop, as `nextStream` will always be called, regardless of the value of `_read`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This change will cause the function to return `null` instead of the expected value, which will likely cause errors in the code that uses this function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This change will cause the function to return `undefined` instead of the expected value, which will likely cause errors in the code that uses this function.

DONE.
