  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `baseIndex` to decrease by the length of the current operation, which could cause the `slice` method to return a different range of operations from the `base` delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex * length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `baseIndex` to increase by the square of the length of the current operation, which could cause the `slice` method to return a different range of operations from the `base` delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex / length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `baseIndex` to decrease by the length of the current operation, which could cause the `slice` method to return a different range of operations from the `base` delta.

DONE.
