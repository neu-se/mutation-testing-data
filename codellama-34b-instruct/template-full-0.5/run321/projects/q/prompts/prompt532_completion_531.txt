  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(value).spread` is a method that spreads the values of a promised array of arguments into the fulfillment callback, while `Q(value).then` is a method that returns a promise for the return value or thrown exception of either callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).all
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(value).spread` is a method that spreads the values of a promised array of arguments into the fulfillment callback, while `Q(value).all` is a method that returns a promise for the return value of the generator or the first rejected promise among those yielded.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(value).spread` is a method that spreads the values of a promised array of arguments into the fulfillment callback, while
