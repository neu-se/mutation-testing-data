  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s instanceof Function
```
This would result in different behavior because `instanceof` checks if an object is an instance of a class, while `typeof` checks the type of a variable. In this case, `s` is a function, but it may not be an instance of the `Function` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.constructor === Function
```
This would result in different behavior because `constructor` is a property of an object that refers to the function that created the object, while `typeof` checks the type of a variable. In this case, `s` is a function, but it may not have the `Function` constructor.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.prototype.constructor === Function
```
This would result in different behavior because `prototype` is a property of a function that refers to the prototype object of the function, while `typeof` checks the type of a variable. In this case, `s` is a function, but it
