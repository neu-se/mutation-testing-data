  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` is a method that adds an element to the end of an array, whereas `concat` is a method that combines two arrays.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` is a method that extracts a section of an array, whereas `concat` is a method that combines two arrays.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` is a method that adds/removes elements from an array, whereas `concat` is a method that combines two arrays.

DONE.
