 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice.call(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array from the arguments object, whereas the original code uses the `array_slice` function which might have some custom behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.keys(arguments)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the first property name from the arguments object, which is not equivalent to slicing the arguments object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Function.prototype.apply.call(arguments, [0].concat(Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1)))
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `apply` method to call the `slice` method on the `arguments` object with the correct context, but it might not behave the same as the original `array_slice` function.

DONE.
