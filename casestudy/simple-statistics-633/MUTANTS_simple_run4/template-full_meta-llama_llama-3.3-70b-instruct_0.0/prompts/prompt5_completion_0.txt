Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof x[i] === "number"
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns NaN when the current element is a number, which is the opposite of the original condition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
i % 2 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns NaN when the index of the current element is even, regardless of the type or value of the element itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
x[i] < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns NaN when the current element is a negative number, which is a different condition than checking the type of the element.

DONE.
