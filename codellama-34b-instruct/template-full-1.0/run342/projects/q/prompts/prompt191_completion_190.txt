  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^.*function ([^ ]+) \((.+):(\d+):(?:\d+)\)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match the entire function declaration, including the function name, and extract the file name and line number from the first line of the stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^.+\/.* at (.+):(\d+):(?:\d+)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match the entire stack trace line and extract the file name and line number from the first line of the stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^.*function .* at (.+):(\d+):(?:\d+)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match the entire stack trace line and extract the file name and line number from the first line of the stack trace.

DONE.
