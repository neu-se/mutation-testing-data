  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value than `null`, and the code checks for `null` explicitly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a different value than `null`, and the code checks for `null` explicitly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because `''` is a different value than `null`, and the code checks for `null` explicitly.

DONE.
