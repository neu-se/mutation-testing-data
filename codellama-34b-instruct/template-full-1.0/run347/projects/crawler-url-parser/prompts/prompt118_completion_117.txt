  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gettype` function would be using the `baseUrl` object instead of the `currentUrl` object to determine the `type` of the link. As a result, the returned type might be different from the expected type, which could cause issues with the functionality of the `gettype` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gettype` function would be using the `null` value instead of the `currentUrl` object to determine the `type` of the link. As a result, the returned type might be different from the expected type, which could cause issues with the functionality of the `gettype` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gettype` function would be using the `linkurl` object instead of the `currentUrl` object to determine the `type` of the
