  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `aborted`, so if `aborted` is `true`, the resulting value would be `false`, and if `aborted` is `false`, the resulting value would be `true`. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` when `aborted` is `true`, and to `true` when `aborted` is `false`, which would result in different behavior than the original code fragment.

DONE.
