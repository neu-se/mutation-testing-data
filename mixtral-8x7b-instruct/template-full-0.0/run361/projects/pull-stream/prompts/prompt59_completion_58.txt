 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(null, function (end, data) {
  if (end) {
    return sink.abort()
  }
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `end` is truthy or if `abort` is truthy, while the modified code only checks if `end` is truthy. This means that if `abort` is truthy but `end` is falsy, the function will not call `sink.abort()` as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(null, function (end, data) {
  if (end || abort === true) {
    return sink.abort()
  }
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `||` operator to check if `end` is truthy or if `abort` is truthy, while the modified code uses the `===` operator to check if `abort` is exactly equal to `true`. This means that if `abort`
