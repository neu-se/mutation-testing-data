  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis, this[index], index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the index would be incremented by 1, which would cause the loop to skip every other element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis, this[index], index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the index would be decremented by 1, which would cause the loop to iterate over the same element multiple times.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis, this[index], index * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the index would be multiplied by 2, which would cause the loop to skip over every other element in the array.

DONE.
