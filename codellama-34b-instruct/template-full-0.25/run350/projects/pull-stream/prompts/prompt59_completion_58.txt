  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `abort`, so if `abort` is `true`, the code would continue to execute, whereas if `abort` is `false`, the code would stop executing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator checks if both `abort` and `true` are truthy, so if `abort` is `true`, the code would continue to execute, whereas if `abort` is `false`, the code would stop executing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator checks if either `abort` or `false` are truthy, so if `abort` is `true`, the code would continue to execute, whereas if `abort` is `false`, the code would
