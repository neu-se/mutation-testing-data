  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
define && define['amd']
```
This would result in different behavior because "define" is a variable name that may not always be defined, and "define['amd']" is not a valid property accessor.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because "typeof define" is not always an object, while "define['amd']" is always an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because "null" is not an object, and cannot be used as a property accessor.

DONE.
