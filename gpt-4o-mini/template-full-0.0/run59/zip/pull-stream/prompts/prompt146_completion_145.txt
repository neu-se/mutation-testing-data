Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because it retrieves the values of the object's properties instead of the keys, which would lead to a different output when the function is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns an array of the object's key-value pairs as arrays, rather than just the keys, which would change the structure of the output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(object).length
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the number of keys in the object instead of the keys themselves, resulting in a single numeric value rather than an array of keys.

DONE.
