  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options ? options.reviver : undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, so it would throw an error if `JSON.parse` is called with `undefined` as the reviver.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options ? options.reviver : null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, so it would throw an error if `JSON.parse` is called with `null` as the reviver.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options ? options.reviver : {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty object is not a function, so it would throw an error if `JSON.parse` is called with an empty object as the reviver.

DONE.
