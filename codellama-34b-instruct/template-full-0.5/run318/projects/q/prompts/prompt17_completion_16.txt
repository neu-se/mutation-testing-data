  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {
    throw new Error("This is a buggy implementation");
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always throw an error, regardless of the input, which is not the intended behavior of the original implementation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {
    return "This is a buggy implementation";
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return a string, regardless of the input, which is not the intended behavior of the original implementation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {
    return null;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return null, regardless of the input, which is not the intended behavior of the original implementation.

DONE.
