  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/e$/, 'es')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly pluralize words that end in "e" but are not preceded by a vowel, such as "cactus" (which should be pluralized as "cacti").

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/y$/, 'ies')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly pluralize words that end in "y" but are not preceded by a vowel, such as "city" (which should be pluralized as "cities").

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/[aeiou]y$/, 'ies')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly pluralize words that end in "y" and are preceded by a vowel, such as "baby" (which should be pluralized as "babies").
