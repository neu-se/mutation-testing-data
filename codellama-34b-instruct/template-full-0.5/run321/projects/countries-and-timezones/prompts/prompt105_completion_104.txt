  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [key]: tzs[key] + 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of the `tzs[key]` property, which could cause the `deliverTimezones` function to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [key]: tzs[key] - 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the value of the `tzs[key]` property, which could cause the `deliverTimezones` function to return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [key]: tzs[key] * 2 }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the value of the `tzs[key]` property by 2, which could cause the `deliverTimezones` function to return incorrect results.

DONE.
