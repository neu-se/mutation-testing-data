  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tanh
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tanh` is the hyperbolic tangent function, which has a different range and output than `Math.cos`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` is the sine function, which has a different output than `Math.cos`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` is the floor function, which rounds a number down to the nearest integer, whereas `Math.cos` is a trigonometric function.

DONE.
