Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because using `sin` instead of `cos` would incorrectly calculate the value of `sinÎ¸`, leading to an incorrect result in the destination point calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing `cos` with `1` would cause the calculation to ignore the actual cosine of the angle, which would significantly alter the resulting destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This would result in different behavior because using `tan` instead of `cos` would change the trigonometric function used in the calculation, leading to an incorrect computation of the destination point based on the bearing.

DONE.
