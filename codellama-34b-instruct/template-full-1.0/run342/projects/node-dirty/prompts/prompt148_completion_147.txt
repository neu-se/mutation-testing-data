  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => cbs
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function is not invoked, and the array of callback functions is returned unchanged.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback functions are copied into a new array instead of being invoked, and the new array is returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.filter(cb => cb != null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback functions are filtered based on whether they are null or not, and the filtered array is returned.

DONE.
