  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Math.floor(this, point);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the result of the `Math.floor` function applied to `this` and `point`, which would be a single number. The original code was returning a `GeoPoint` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Math.ceil(this, point);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the result of the `Math.ceil` function applied to `this` and `point`, which would be a single number. The original code was returning a `GeoPoint` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Math.round(this, point);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the result of the `Math.round` function applied to `this` and `point`, which would be a single number. The original code was returning a `GeoPoint` object.

DONE.
