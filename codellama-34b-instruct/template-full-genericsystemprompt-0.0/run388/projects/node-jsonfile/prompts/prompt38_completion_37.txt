  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromPromise` is a different function than `universalify.fromCallback`, and it may not handle errors in the same way.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFile)
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromCallback` expects a callback function as its first argument, but `fs.writeFile` is not a callback function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFileSync)
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromCallback` expects a callback function as its first argument, but `fs.writeFileSync` is not a callback function.

DONE.
