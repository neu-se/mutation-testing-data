  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a + 1` expression would be evaluated to a different value than `a`, causing the `sin` function to produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a * 2` expression would be evaluated to a different value than `a`, causing the `sin` function to produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a / 2` expression would be evaluated to a different value than `a`, causing the `sin` function to produce a different result.

DONE.
