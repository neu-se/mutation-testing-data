  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.error
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.error` would log the error message to the console, whereas `console.warn` would log a warning message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.log` would log a message to the console, whereas `console.warn` would log a warning message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.info
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.info` would log an informational message to the console, whereas `console.warn` would log a warning message.

DONE.
