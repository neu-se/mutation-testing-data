  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.push(line);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the current line to the `desiredLines` array, whereas the original code fragment does not add the line to the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.push(line.toUpperCase());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the current line to the `desiredLines` array in uppercase, whereas the original code fragment does not modify the line before adding it to the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.push(line.split(" ")[0]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the first word of the current line to the `desiredLines` array, whereas the original code fragment does not modify the line before adding it to the array.

DONE.
