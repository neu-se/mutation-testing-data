  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(reject(new Error(reason)));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new error object with the reason as the message, rather than using the original reason object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(reject(reason.message));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the message property of the reason object, rather than the object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(reject(reason.stack));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the stack property of the reason object, rather than the object itself.

DONE.
