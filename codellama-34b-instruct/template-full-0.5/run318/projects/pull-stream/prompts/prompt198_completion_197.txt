  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort
```
This would result in different behavior because `abort` is a function that takes an error object as an argument, whereas `cb` is a function that takes a callback function as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, whereas `cb` is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, whereas `cb` is a function.

DONE.
