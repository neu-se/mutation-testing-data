  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'e') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is not the same as the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'e') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function is not the same as the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'e') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern and the function are not the same as the original code fragment.

DONE.
