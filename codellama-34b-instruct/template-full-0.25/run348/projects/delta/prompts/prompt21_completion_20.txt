  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if the values are not equal, even if one of the values is `null` or `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== b[key] && a[key] !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `true` if the values are not equal and the value in `a` is not `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== b[key] && b[key] !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `true` if the values are not equal and the value in `b` is not `null`.

DONE.
