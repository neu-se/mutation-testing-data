  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `thisData` is now a constant `2` instead of a variable, which could cause the `transform` function to behave differently in certain scenarios.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisData - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisData - 1` would change the value of `thisData` inside the function, which could affect the behavior of the function in certain scenarios.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisData.otherProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the property being referred to inside the function.

DONE.
