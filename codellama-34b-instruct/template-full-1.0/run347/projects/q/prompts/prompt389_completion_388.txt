  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(resolved < 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `(resolved < 0)` is always false, so the `isPending` function will always return false, and the `if` statement will never be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(resolved > 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `(resolved > 0)` is always true, so the `isPending` function will always return true, and the `if` statement will always be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(resolved !== 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `(resolved !== 0)` is true if `resolved` is not 0, but false if `resolved` is 0, so the `isPending` function will return true if `resolved` is not 0, and false if `resolved` is 0.

DONE.
