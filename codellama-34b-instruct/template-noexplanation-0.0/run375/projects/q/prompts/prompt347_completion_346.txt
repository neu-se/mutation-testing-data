  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected !== null
```
This change will cause the `rejected` function to be called even if it is not a function, which may cause unexpected behavior in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof rejected !== "undefined"
```
This change will cause the `rejected` function to be called only if it is defined, which may prevent errors if the `rejected` function is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected instanceof Function
```
This change will cause the `rejected` function to be called only if it is a function, which may prevent errors if the `rejected` function is not a function.

DONE.
