  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this.close()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` method is not called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this.close(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` method is called with an argument, which could affect its behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this.destroy()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `destroy` method is called instead of `close`.

DONE.
