Your task is to apply mutation testing to the following code:
```
import { Rule } from './rule'
import { Queryable, QueryContext } from './queryable'

/** Access-control policy. */
export class Policy implements Queryable {
  /** Policy name. */
  readonly name: string
  /** Rules comprising policy. */
  readonly rules: Rule[]

  constructor (name: string, ...rules: Rule[]) {
    this.name = name
    this.rules = rules
  }

  /** Add rules to a policy. */
  push (...rules: Rule[]): Policy {
    this.rules.push(...rules)
    return this
  }

  /** Check whether an action is allowed on a path.
    * @param path Path to be acted on.
    * @param verb Action to be performed.
    * @param ctx Query context for resolving context-dependent paths.
    * @returns Returns `true` if the action is explicitly allowed,
    *          `false` if the action is explicitly denied, or
    *          `null` if the combination of path and action
    *          is not governed by this policy. */
  query (path: string, verb: string, ctx?: QueryContext): boolean | null {
    let allow = null
    for (const rule of this.rules) {
      const res = rule.query(path, verb, ctx)
      if (res === false) {
        return false
      }
      if (res === true) {
        allow = true
      }
    }
    return allow
  }

  /** Check whether a path is governed by this policy.
    * @param path Path to be checked.
    * @param ctx Query context for resolving context-dependent paths. */
  matches (path: string, ctx?: QueryContext): boolean {
    for (const rule of this.rules) {
      if (<PLACEHOLDER>) {
        return true
      }
    }
    return false
  }

  /** Create clone of a policy.
    * @param name Replacement name for new policy.
    * @param deep Deep copy; clone underlying rules as well. */
  clone (name: string = this.name, deep: boolean = true): Policy {
    return deep
      ? new Policy(name, ...this.rules.map((rule) => rule.clone()))
      : new Policy(name, ...this.rules)
  }

  /** Static constructor function; returns a new Policy. */
  static for (name: string, ...rules: Rule[]): Policy {
    return new Policy(name, ...rules)
  }
}

```

by replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different
behavior than the original code fragment, which was:
```
rule.matches(path, ctx)
```
Please consider changes such as using different operators, changing constants,
referring to different variables, object properties, functions, or methods.  

Provide three answers as fenced code blocks containing a single line of code,
using the following template:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```

Please conclude your response with "DONE."
