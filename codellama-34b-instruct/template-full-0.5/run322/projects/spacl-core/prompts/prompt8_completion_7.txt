  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` is a different method than `match`, and it would return the index of the first occurrence of the specified value in the string, rather than a boolean indicating whether the value is present in the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the characters in the string, rather than returning the same string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the string to uppercase, rather than returning the same string.

DONE.
