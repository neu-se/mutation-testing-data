  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `nearerValue` is always a promise, so the `valueOf` method would always return a promise, even if the promise is resolved with a non-promise value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `nearerValue` is always a promise, so the `valueOf` method would always return a promise, even if the promise is resolved with a non-promise value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue.isFulfilled()
```
This would result in different behavior because `nearerValue` is always a promise, so the `valueOf` method would always return a promise, even if the promise is resolved with a non-promise value.

DONE.
