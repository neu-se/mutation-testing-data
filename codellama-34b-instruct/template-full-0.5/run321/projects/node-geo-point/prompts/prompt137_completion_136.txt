  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.longitude` is not a function and cannot be called like one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
adjust(this.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because `adjust` is not a function and cannot be called like one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseFloat(this.longitude.toFixed(precision))
```
This would result in different behavior because `toFixed` is not a function of `longitude` and cannot be called like one.

DONE.
