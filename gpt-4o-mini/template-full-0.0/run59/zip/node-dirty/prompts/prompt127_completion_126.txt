Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size === 0 && !this._waitForDrain
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the logic to only proceed if the queue is empty and not waiting for drain, which is the opposite of the original condition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size > 0 && this._waitForDrain
```
This would result in different behavior because it requires both the queue to have items and to be waiting for drain, which would prevent flushing when there are items in the queue, contrary to the original logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size !== 0 || this._waitForDrain
```
This would result in different behavior because it allows the flushing to occur if either the queue is not empty or if it is waiting for drain, which could lead to premature flushing compared to the original condition.

DONE.
