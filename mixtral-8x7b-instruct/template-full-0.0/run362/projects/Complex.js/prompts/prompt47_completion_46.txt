 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'abs' of a && 'arg' of a
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `of` operator instead of `in`, which would always return false since `a` is not an iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'abs' in Object(a) && 'arg' in Object(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps `a` with `Object()`, which would convert primitives to their corresponding object wrappers. This could lead to unexpected results when comparing properties of the original primitive value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'toString' in a && 'valueOf' in a
