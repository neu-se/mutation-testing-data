  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFileSync)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFileSync` is a synchronous function, whereas `fs.writeFile` is an asynchronous function. Using `fs.writeFileSync` would cause the code to block until the file is written, which could lead to performance issues and unresponsive behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFile.bind(fs))
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFile.bind(fs)` is a bound function that always uses the `fs` module as the `this` value, whereas `fs.writeFile` is a method that can be called on any object that implements the `fs` API. Using `fs.writeFile.bind(fs)` would cause the code to always use the `fs` module, even if the `fs` object is not available.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with
