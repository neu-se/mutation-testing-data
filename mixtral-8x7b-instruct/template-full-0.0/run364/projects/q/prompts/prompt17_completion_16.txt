 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { throw new Error('Buggy code fragment'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because a new error is thrown, which was not the case in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
noop
```
This would result in different behavior because the `noop` function does nothing, while the original code fragment might have different behavior depending on the implementation of `definition`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { definition(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the new function wraps the original `definition` function, potentially changing the context or behavior of `definition`.

DONE.
