  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.prev()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.prev()` will return the
previous operation in the sequence, whereas `iter.next()` returns the next
operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.peek(0)` will return the
current operation in the sequence, whereas `iter.next()` returns the next
operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.peek(1)` will return the
next operation in the sequence, whereas `iter.next()` returns the current
operation.

DONE.
