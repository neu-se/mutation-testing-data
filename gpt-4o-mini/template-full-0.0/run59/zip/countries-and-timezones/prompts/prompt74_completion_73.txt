Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to build a timezone using the country ID instead of the timezone name, likely resulting in incorrect or undefined timezone data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the timezone name to uppercase before attempting to memoize it, which could lead to mismatches in the `timezones` object if the keys are stored in a different case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` to `buildTimezone` would likely cause it to return an invalid or undefined timezone object, which would not be memoized correctly and could lead to unexpected results when retrieving timezones.

DONE.
