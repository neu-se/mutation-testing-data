  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.get(key).push(cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because this code would push the callback function onto the list of callbacks for a key, rather than creating a new list of callbacks for the key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because this code would set the callback function as the value for a key, rather than creating a list of callback functions for the key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.push(key, cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because this code would push the callback function onto the end of the list of values for a key, rather than creating a new list of callback functions for the key.

DONE.
