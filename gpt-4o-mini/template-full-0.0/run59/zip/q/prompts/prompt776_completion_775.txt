Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject("Error")
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of resolving the promise with the original value, it would immediately reject the promise with a string error message, causing the `allSettled` function to return a rejected state instead of the expected resolved state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(42)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with a constant value of `42` instead of the original promise's value, which could lead to incorrect results in the context where the original promise's value is expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that resolves to `null`, which may not represent the intended value of the original promise, potentially leading to unexpected results in the promise chain.

DONE.
