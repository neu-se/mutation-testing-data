  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method is not called with any arguments, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a default error message instead of the specific error message that is passed to the `reject` method in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.reject(new Error('Custom error message'))
```
This would result in different behavior because a custom error message is passed to the `reject` method, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a different error message than the one that is passed in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.reject(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is passed to the `reject` method, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a `TypeError` instead of the specific error message that is passed to the `reject` method in the original code.

DONE
