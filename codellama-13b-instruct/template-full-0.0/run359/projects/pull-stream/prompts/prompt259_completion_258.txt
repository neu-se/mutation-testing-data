  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nextStream()` function is called immediately, rather than waiting for the `nextChunk()` function to be called. This could cause the stream to be read twice, which could result in unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read(null, function (err, data) {
  if (err) {
    if (err === true) nextStream()
    else read(true, function(abortErr) {
      // TODO: what do we do with the abortErr?
      cb(err)
    })
  }
  else cb(null, data)
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nextStream()` function is called inside the `if (err)` block, rather than outside of it. This could cause the stream to be read twice, which could result in unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read(null,
