 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the result of `Math.cos`, introducing a division by zero when the cosine is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.acos
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the arc cosine instead of the cosine, which may lead to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(Math.log(Math.cos(a)))
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the cosine using a more complex approach, which may introduce rounding errors or other inaccuracies.

DONE.
