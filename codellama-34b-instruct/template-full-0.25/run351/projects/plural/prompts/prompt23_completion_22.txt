  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the 'i' character to form the plural form of the word, while this new code fragment uses the 'es' characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'us' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the 'i' character to form the plural form of the word, while this new code fragment uses the 'us' characters.
