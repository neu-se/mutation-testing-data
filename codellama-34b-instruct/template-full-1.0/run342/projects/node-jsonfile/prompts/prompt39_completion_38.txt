  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFileSync` is a synchronous method, whereas `fs.writeFile` is an asynchronous method. Using `fs.writeFileSync` would cause the `_writeFile` function to block the event loop and wait for the file to be written to disk, potentially causing performance issues.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFileSync` takes an additional `options` argument, which allows for more customization of the write operation. Using `fs.writeFileSync` would cause the `_writeFile` function to perform a synchronous write operation with the specified `options`, potentially resulting in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFile
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFile` is an asynchronous method, whereas `fs.writeFileSync` is a synchronous method
