  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"put"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `put` method is not defined in the `Promise.prototype` and would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is not defined in the `Promise.prototype` and would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method is not defined in the `Promise.prototype` and would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

DONE.
