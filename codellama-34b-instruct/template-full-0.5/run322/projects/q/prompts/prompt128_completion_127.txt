  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the property `key` in `object`, whereas the original code fragment returns `object` itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key in object
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a boolean value indicating whether `key` is a property of `object`, whereas the original code fragment returns `object` itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a boolean value indicating whether `object` has an own property named `key`, whereas the original code fragment returns `object` itself.

DONE.
