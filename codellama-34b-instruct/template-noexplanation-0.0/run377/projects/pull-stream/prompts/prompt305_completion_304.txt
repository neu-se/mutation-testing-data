  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && cb
```
This change will cause the `read` function to be called with `ended` as the first argument, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended, cb
```
This change will cause the `read` function to be called with `!ended` as the first argument, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || cb
```
This change will cause the `read` function to be called with `ended` as the first argument, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
