  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(function (obj) {
    return obj.dispatch.apply(obj, ["post", [name, args]]);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a promise that resolves to the return value of the `dispatch` method, rather than the return value of the `post` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(function (obj) {
    return obj.dispatch.apply(obj, ["post", [name, args]]).then(function (result) {
        return Q(result);
    });
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a promise that resolves to a promise that resolves to the return value of the `post` method, rather than the return value of the `dispatch` method.
