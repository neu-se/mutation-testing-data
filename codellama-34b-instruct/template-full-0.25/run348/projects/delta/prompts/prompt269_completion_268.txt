  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.retain(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain one character from the original delta, rather than chopping it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.delete(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete one character from the original delta, rather than chopping it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.retain(retDelta.length())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the entire length of the original delta, rather than chopping it.

DONE.
