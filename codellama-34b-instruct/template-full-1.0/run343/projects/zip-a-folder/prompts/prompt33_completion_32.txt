  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.error
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `reject`, which would cause the promise to reject, while `console.error` would simply log an error message to the console.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `reject`, which would cause the promise to reject, while `throw` would throw an error that would need to be caught.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `reject`, which would cause the promise to reject, while `return` would simply return a value from the function.

DONE.
