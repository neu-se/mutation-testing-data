  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.hasNext` is a function that returns a boolean value indicating whether the iterator has more elements, while `otherIter.hasNext()` is a function call that returns the result of the function, which is a boolean value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekType()` returns the type of the next element in the iterator, while `otherIter.hasNext()` returns a boolean value indicating whether the iterator has more elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekLength()` returns the length of the next element in the iterator, while `otherIter.hasNext()` returns a boolean value indicating whether the iterator has more elements.

DONE.
