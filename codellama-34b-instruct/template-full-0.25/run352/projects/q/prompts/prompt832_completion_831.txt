  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called with a fulfilled promise, rather than a rejected one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called with a rejected promise, rather than a fulfilled one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected(new Error("custom error message"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called with a rejected promise, rather than a fulfilled one, and the error message would be different.

DONE.
