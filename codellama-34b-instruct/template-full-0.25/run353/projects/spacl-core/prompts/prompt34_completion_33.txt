  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(2).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method is now starting from the third element instead of the second, which would cause the resulting array to be one element shorter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting array is now joined into a string instead of being returned as an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().map(x => x.toUpperCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting array is now mapped to uppercase strings instead of being returned as is.

DONE.
