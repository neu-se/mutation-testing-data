 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'./'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the path to a relative path starting from the current directory instead of keeping it as a slash for the root directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the last character of the path, replacing it with a space, which might not be the intended behavior and could lead to issues when comparing paths.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
''
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the last character of the path, replacing it with an empty string, which might not be the intended behavior and could lead to issues when comparing paths.

DONE.
