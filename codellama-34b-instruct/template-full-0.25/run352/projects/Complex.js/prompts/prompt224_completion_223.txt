  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is greater than or equal to 0, while this new code fragment only checks if `a` is strictly greater than 0. This means that if `a` is equal to 0, the original code fragment would return a value, while this new code fragment would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is greater than or equal to 0, while this new code fragment checks if `a` is not equal to 0. This means that if `a` is equal to 0, the original code fragment would return a value, while this new code fragment would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is greater than or equal to 0,
