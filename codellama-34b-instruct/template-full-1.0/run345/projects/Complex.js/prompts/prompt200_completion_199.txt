  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is not the same as `b` and could produce different results in the complex exponent function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is not the same as `b` and could produce different results in the complex exponent function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because `1` is not the same as `b` and could produce different results in the complex exponent function.

DONE.
