  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.filter(rule => rule.clone())
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` returns a new array with only the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, while `map` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.slice(0).map(rule => rule.clone())
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(0)` creates a shallow copy of the `rules` array, while `map` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.reduce((acc, rule) => acc.concat(rule.clone()), [])
```
This would result in different behavior because `reduce` returns a single value, while `map` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element.

DONE.
