 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` inside the `continuer` function might not refer to the correct object, causing unexpected issues.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
window
```
This would result in different behavior because using `window` instead of the `continuer` function would cause the code to break, as it would not have access to the required variables and functions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { return continuer; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would wrap the `continuer` function inside another function, causing it to lose its binding to the correct `this` value and not having access to the correct outer scope.

DONE.
