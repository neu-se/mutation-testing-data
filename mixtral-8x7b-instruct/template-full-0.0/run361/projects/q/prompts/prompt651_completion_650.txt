 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"POST"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string comparison in the `dispatch` method would fail, causing the method to return an unhandled `"post"` operation instead of the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
symbol("post")
