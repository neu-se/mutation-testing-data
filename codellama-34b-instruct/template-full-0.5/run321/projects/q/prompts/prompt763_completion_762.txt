  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises, Q.resolve(promises)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve(promises)` would return a new promise that is already resolved with the value of `promises`, whereas `promises` would return the original promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises, Q.reject(promises)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject(promises)` would return a new promise that is already rejected with the value of `promises`, whereas `promises` would return the original promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises, Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` would return a new deferred object, whereas `promises` would return the original promise.

DONE.
