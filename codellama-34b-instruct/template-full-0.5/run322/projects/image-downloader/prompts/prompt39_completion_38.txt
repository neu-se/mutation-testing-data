  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `resolve` is used to resolve the promise with the `filename` object, while `reject` would reject the promise with the `filename` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `resolve` is used to resolve the promise with the `filename` object, while `resolve(null)` would resolve the promise with a null value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve({})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `resolve` is used to resolve the promise with the `filename` object, while `resolve({})` would resolve the promise with an empty object.

DONE.
