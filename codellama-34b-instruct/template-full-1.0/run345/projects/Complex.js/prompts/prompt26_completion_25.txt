  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.error('Invalid Param');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace an exception with a log statement, which would not interrupt the execution of the program or indicate to the user that an invalid parameter was passed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (x < 1e-9) {
  return 0;
} else {
  throw new Error('Invalid Param');
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only throw an exception if the absolute value of the parameter was less than 1e-9, which would allow for a small range of valid parameter values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (Number.isNaN(x)) {
  return 0;
} else {
  throw new Error('Invalid Param');
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only throw an exception if the parameter was not a number (NaN), which would allow for other invalid parameter values.
