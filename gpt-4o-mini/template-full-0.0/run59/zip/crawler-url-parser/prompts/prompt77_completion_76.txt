Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').attr('href') || 'http://default.url'
```
This would result in different behavior because it provides a default URL if the `<base>` tag is not present, potentially leading to different parsing results compared to using the actual `<base>` tag's `href`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').attr('href') && 'https://example.com'
```
This would result in different behavior because it will only assign a value if the `<base>` tag exists and has an `href`, otherwise it will always use 'https://example.com', ignoring the actual base URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').attr('href') ? 'ftp://example.com' : null
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the protocol to `ftp` if the `<base>` tag exists, which is not a valid protocol for web URLs in this context, potentially leading to incorrect URL parsing.

DONE.
