 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'dice', 'dice'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original rule adds an 's' to the end of 'die' to form 'dies', but the buggy rule does not change 'dice'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'die', 'di'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original rule adds an 's' to the end of 'die' to form 'dies', but the buggy rule changes 'die' to 'di', which is not the correct plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'dice', 'di'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original rule does not change 'dice', but the buggy rule changes 'dice' to 'di', which is not the correct plural form.

DONE.
