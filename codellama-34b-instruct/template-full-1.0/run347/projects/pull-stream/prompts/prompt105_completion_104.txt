  DONE. The changes that were made to the code are as follows:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This code fragment is functionally different than the original because `undefined` is not a valid parameter for the `drain` function. This error would be caught by the test suite if the test cases were properly written.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This code fragment is functionally different than the original because `true` is not a valid value for the `drain` function. This error would be caught by the test suite if the test cases were properly written.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This code fragment is functionally different than the original because it calls an empty function. This error would be caught by the test suite if the test cases were properly written.

DONE.
