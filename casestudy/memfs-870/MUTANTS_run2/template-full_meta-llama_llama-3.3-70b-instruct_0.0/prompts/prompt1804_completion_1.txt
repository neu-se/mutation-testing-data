Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'non-existent-file'
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to open a non-existent file, which would throw an error, whereas the original code opens the file specified by the `filename` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
filename + '.tmp'
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to open a different file (with a `.tmp` extension) than the one specified by the `filename` variable, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.getLinkOrThrow(filename, 'chmod').getNode().getPath()
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a different method to resolve the file path, potentially leading to differences in how the file is accessed or errors that are thrown.

DONE.
