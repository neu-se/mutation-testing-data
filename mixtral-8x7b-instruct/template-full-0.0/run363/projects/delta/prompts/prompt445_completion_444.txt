 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops[this.index - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the previous element in the `ops` array instead of the current one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.slice(this.index, 1)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new array containing the single element at the specified index, and then access the first (and only) element of that array. This is less efficient and has slightly different behavior than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.filter(op => op !== undefined)[this.index]
