  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[match, result.toLowerCase()]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would be called on the result, which would return a different value than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[match, result + "s"]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would add an extra "s" to the result, which would change the output of the `plural` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[match, result.substr(1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would return the substring of the result starting from the second character, which would change the output of the `plural` function.

DONE.
