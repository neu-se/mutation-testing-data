  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.notOk
```
This would result in different behavior because `ses.notOk` is the opposite of `ses.ok`, so the conditional statement would be negated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.maybeOk
```
This would result in different behavior because `ses.maybeOk` is a new property that doesn't exist in the `ses` object, so the conditional statement would always evaluate to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.ok && ses.notOk
```
This would result in different behavior because the conditional statement would always evaluate to `false`, regardless of the value of `ses.ok`.

DONE.
