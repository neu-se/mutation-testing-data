  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would reject the promise, whereas `deferred.resolve` would resolve it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.fulfill
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.fulfill` is not a valid method, whereas `deferred.resolve` and `deferred.reject` are.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` would create a new rejected promise, whereas `deferred.resolve` and `deferred.reject` would resolve or reject the existing promise.

DONE.
