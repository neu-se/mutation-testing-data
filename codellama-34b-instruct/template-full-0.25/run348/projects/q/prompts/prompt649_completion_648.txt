  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [args, name]
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments to the `dispatch` method would be swapped, which could cause the method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, args.reverse()]
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments to the `dispatch` method would be reversed, which could cause the method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, args.slice(1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument to the `dispatch` method would be removed, which could cause the method to behave differently.

DONE.
