 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 * data
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the `data` by 1, which doesn't change the value, but the test suite should be aware of this change and check if the output is still the same.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the `data` to a string, which might cause issues if the test suite expects a specific data type as output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data || []
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns an empty array if `data` is falsy, which might cause issues if the test suite expects a specific output for falsy values.

By applying these mutations, the test suite will have a chance to catch potential issues and improve its effectiveness in testing the code. DONE.
