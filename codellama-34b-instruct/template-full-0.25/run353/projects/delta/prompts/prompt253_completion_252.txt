  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `opLength` variable would be incremented by 1, which could cause the `while` loop to execute one more iteration than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `opLength` variable would be decremented by 1, which could cause the `while` loop to execute one fewer iteration than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `opLength` variable would be multiplied by 2, which could cause the `while` loop to execute twice as many iterations as intended.

DONE.
