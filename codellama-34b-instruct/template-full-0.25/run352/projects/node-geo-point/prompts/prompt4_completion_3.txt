  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type !== 'Point'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `type` property of the `point` object is not equal to `'Point'`, which is the opposite of the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length !== 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `coordinates` property of the `point` object is not an array with a length of 2, which is the opposite of the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates[0] !== point.coordinates[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the first and second elements of the `coordinates` array are not equal, which is the opposite of the original code fragment.

DONE.
