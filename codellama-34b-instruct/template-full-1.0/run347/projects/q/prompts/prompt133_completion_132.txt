  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String
```
This would result in different behavior because String is not a function, while Object is a function and is used to create new objects in JavaScript.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{hello: "world"}
```
This would result in different behavior because {hello: "world"} is an object literal, while Object is a function and is used to create new objects in JavaScript.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log
```
This would result in different behavior because console.log is a function that outputs messages to the console, while Object is a function and is used to create new objects in JavaScript.

DONE.
