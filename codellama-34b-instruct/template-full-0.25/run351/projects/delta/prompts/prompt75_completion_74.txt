  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cloneDeep(newOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cloneDeep` creates a deep copy of the object, which is not the intended behavior in this case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(newOp))
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.parse` and `JSON.stringify` are not equivalent to `cloneDeep`. They will produce a different object with different properties and methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.assign({}, newOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.assign` creates a shallow copy of the object, which is not the intended behavior in this case.

DONE.
