 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison would always return `false`, causing the `inverse` method to return `Complex['INFINITY']` for all cases, even when the number is not infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.isZero()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `isZero` method on the `this` object, which might not be equivalent to checking if the denominator is zero. This could lead to incorrect results or exceptions when the `this` object does not have an `isZero` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the strict equality comparison would only be `true` when the denominator is exactly equal to zero, while the original code might treat other cases as zero as well (e.g., `-0`, `Number.EPSILON`,
