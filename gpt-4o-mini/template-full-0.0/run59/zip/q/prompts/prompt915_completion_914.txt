Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer();
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the `defer` function without capturing its return value, leading to a situation where the promise is not properly resolved or rejected, potentially causing unhandled promise rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(true);
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes a boolean argument to the `defer` function, which may not be expected by the original implementation, potentially causing the promise to behave incorrectly or not resolve as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.call(this);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the context in which `defer` is called, which may lead to unexpected results if `defer` relies on its internal context (e.g., `this` referring to a specific object).

DONE.
