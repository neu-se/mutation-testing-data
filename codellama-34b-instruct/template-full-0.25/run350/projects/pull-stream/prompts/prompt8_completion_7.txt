  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sources
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the `sources` object instead of the `sinks` object, which could lead to different results in the `for` loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throughs
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the `throughs` object instead of the `sinks` object, which could lead to different results in the `for` loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exports
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the `exports` object instead of the `sinks` object, which could lead to different results in the `for` loop.

DONE.
