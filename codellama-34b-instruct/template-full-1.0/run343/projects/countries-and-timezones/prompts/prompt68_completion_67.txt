  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (!country.id)
```
This would result in different behavior because if `country` is undefined or null, the `id` property will not be checked and the country will be memoized regardless of whether it has an `id` property or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (Object.keys(country).length === 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `country` object has any properties, and if it does not, it will memoize the country.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (!country.hasOwnProperty('id'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `country` object has an `id` property, and if it does not, it will memoize the country.

DONE.
