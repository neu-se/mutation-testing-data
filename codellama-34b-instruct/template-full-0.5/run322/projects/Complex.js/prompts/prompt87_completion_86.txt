  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` checks whether a value is a finite number, whereas `isNaN` checks whether a value is not a number. In the context of the original code, using `isFinite` instead of `isNaN` would cause the code to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isNaN` checks whether a value is not not a number, which is always true. In the context of the original code, using `!isNaN` instead of `isNaN` would cause the code to produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof a === 'number'` checks whether the type of `a` is a number, whereas `isNaN` checks whether the value of `a` is not a number. In the context of the original
