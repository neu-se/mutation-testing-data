  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned an object, while the new code fragment returns a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned an object, while the new code fragment returns a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned an object, while the new code fragment returns a function.

DONE.
