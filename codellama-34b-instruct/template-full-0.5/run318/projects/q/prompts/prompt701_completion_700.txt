  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment slices the `arguments` object from index 0, but the new code fragment slices it from index 1, which would exclude the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment slices the `arguments` object from index 0 to the end, but the new code fragment slices it from index 0 to index 1, which would include only the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment slices the `arguments` object from index 0, but the new code fragment slices it from the end, which would include only the last argument.

DONE.
