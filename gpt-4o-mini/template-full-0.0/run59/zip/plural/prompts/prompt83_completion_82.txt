Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'moose'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'moose' is an uncountable noun and does not have a plural form, while 'mouse' has the plural 'mice'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'moos'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'moos' is not the correct plural form of 'mouse', which is 'mice', leading to incorrect pluralization.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'moosey'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'moosey' is not a valid word and does not correspond to any pluralization rule, while 'mouse' correctly pluralizes to 'mice'.

DONE.
