  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(thisp, arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because `callback.apply` would be called with `thisp` as the `this` value instead of `callback` as the `this` value, which could cause differences in the function's behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(arguments).apply(thisp);
```
This would result in different behavior because `callback.apply(arguments)` would return a new function that takes `thisp` as an argument, and calling `apply` on that function would execute the `callback` function with `thisp` as the `this` value, which could cause differences in the function's behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp.apply(callback, arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisp.apply` would not be a function and would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

DONE.
