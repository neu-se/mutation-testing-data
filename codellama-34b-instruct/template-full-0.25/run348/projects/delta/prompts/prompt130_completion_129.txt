  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one less time, potentially missing the last element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one more time, potentially causing an error if the array is not large enough.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - end
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate in the opposite direction, potentially causing an error if the array is not large enough.

DONE.
