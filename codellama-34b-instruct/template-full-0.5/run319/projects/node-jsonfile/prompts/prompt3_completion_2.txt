  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `file` variable as a file path, while the new code fragment is using the `toString()` method on the `file` variable, which could potentially return a different string representation of the file path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file + '.json'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `file` variable as a file path, while the new code fragment is adding the '.json' extension to the file path, which could potentially change the file path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFileSync(file)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFile)` function to read the file, while the new code fragment is using the `fs.readFileSync` function to read the file, which could potentially return a different result.
