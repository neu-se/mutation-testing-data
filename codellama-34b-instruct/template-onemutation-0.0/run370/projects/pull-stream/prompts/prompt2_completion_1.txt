  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinks
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinks` is a different object than `sources`, and the code is using the `sources` object to create a new object. By replacing `sources` with `sinks`, the code would be creating a new object using the `sinks` object instead, which could potentially cause different behavior.

DONE.
