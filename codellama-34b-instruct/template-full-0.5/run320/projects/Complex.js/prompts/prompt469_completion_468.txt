  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to always return a positive imaginary part, even if the input was negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b != 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to always return a non-zero imaginary part, even if the input was zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b <= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to always return a negative or zero imaginary part, even if the input was positive.

DONE.
