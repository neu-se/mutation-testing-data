  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason.stack.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` creates a shallow copy of the `stack` property, which is a string, and the original code does not make a copy. This could cause the `untrackRejection()` function to not properly remove the rejection from the `unhandledRejections` array, leading to incorrect tracking of unhandled rejections.

DONE.
