  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('a').first()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only select the first anchor element in the document, whereas the original code fragment selects all anchor elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$("a").not(":first-child")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would select all anchor elements except for the first-child of their parent element, whereas the original code fragment selects all anchor elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$("a").not(":first")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would select all anchor elements except for the first one in the document, whereas the original code fragment selects all anchor elements.

DONE.
