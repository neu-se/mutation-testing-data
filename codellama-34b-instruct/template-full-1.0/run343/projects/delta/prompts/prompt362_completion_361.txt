  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(<length>);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate through the length of the op, rather than the entire op.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(<length>);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate through the length of the other op, rather than the entire op.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(thisIter.peekLength() - <length>);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip over a portion of the op, rather than iterating through the entire op.

DONE.
