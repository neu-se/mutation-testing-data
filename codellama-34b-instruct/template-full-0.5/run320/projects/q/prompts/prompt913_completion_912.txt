  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` returns a copy of the array, while `array_slice.reverse()` mutates the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` returns a copy of the array, while `array_slice.length` returns the length of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` returns a copy of the array, while `array_slice.pop()` removes the last element of the array and returns it.

DONE.
