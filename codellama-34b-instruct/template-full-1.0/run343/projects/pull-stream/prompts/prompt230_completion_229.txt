  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the ! operator would invert the result of the `test` function, causing the `read` function to return the data if it matches the regular expression, instead of if it doesn't match.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data + 'foo')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would be applied to a modified version of the data, which may or may not match the original intent of the tests.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would be applied to a modified version of the data, which may or may not match the original intent of the tests.

DONE.
