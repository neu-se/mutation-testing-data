  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.calculateDistance(this, bearing)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDistance` method takes two `GeoPoint` objects as arguments, but the `bearing` variable is a number. This would cause a type error when the method is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.calculateDestination(this, distance)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDestination` method takes two `GeoPoint` objects as arguments, but the `distance` variable is a number. This would cause a type error when the method is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.calculateBearing(this, distance)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateBearing` method takes two `GeoPoint` objects as arguments, but the `distance` variable is a number. This would cause a type error when the method
