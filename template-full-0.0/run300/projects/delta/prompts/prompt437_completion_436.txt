  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.attributes[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first attribute of the `nextOp` object, whereas the original code fragment considers all attributes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.attributes.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the number of attributes of the `nextOp` object, whereas the original code fragment considers the actual attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.attributes.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the attributes of the `nextOp` object starting from the second attribute, whereas the original code fragment considers all attributes.

DONE.
