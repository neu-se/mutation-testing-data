  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb of verbs.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys()` method returns an array of the keys in the `verbs` object, rather than the values. This would cause the `allow()` method to iterate over the keys of the `verbs` object, rather than the values, which could result in unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb of verbs.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `values()` method returns an array of the values in the `verbs` object, rather than the keys. This would cause the `allow()` method to iterate over the values of the `verbs` object, rather than the keys, which could result in unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb of verbs.entries()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `entries()` method returns an array of the key-value pairs in the `verbs` object, rather
