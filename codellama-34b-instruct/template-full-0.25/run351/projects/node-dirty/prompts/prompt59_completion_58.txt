  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.close(this._readStream);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would close the read stream before the write stream, which could cause errors if the write stream is still in use.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.close(this._writeStream);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would close the write stream before the read stream, which could cause errors if the read stream is still in use.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.close(this._readStream, this._writeStream);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would close both the read and write streams at the same time, which could cause errors if either stream is still in use.

DONE.
