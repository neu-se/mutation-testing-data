 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
delta.push('dummy')
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes a string 'dummy' into the delta instead of an operation object, which can cause unexpected results in further operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
delta.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the `pop` method instead of the `push` method, which removes the last element from the delta array, causing data loss.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
otherOp.delete = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the `otherOp` object by setting the `delete` property to a number, which can cause unexpected behavior in the following conditions and the final result of the `compose` method.

DONE.
