  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.reduce((a, b) => a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the sum of the elements in the array, rather than the concatenation of the strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.reduce((a, b) => a * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the product of the elements in the array, rather than the concatenation of the strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.reduce((a, b) => a - b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the difference between the elements in the array, rather than the concatenation of the strings.

DONE.
