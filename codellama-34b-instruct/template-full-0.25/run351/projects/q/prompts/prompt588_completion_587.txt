  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.spawn(function* () {
    var foo = yield getFooPromise();
    var bar = yield getBarPromise();
    return foo + bar;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.spawn` function is not defined in the code snippet provided, and it is not clear what its purpose is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(function () {
    var foo = yield getFooPromise();
    var bar = yield getBarPromise();
    return foo + bar;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.async` function is not defined in the code snippet provided, and it is not clear what its purpose is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.promised(function () {
    var foo = yield getFooPromise();
    var bar = yield getBarPromise();
    return foo + bar;
})
