  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!mapper
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the value of `mapper`, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` and the `id` function to be returned, regardless of the value of `mapper`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add 1 to the value of `mapper`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` if `mapper` is 0 or less, and the `id` function to be returned in those cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would multiply the value of `mapper` by 2, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` if `mapper` is 0 or less, and the `id` function to be
