  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value.then(function (value) { return value; });
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.value` is a promise, and `.then()` is a method that allows you to handle the fulfillment or rejection of that promise. In this case, it would return a promise for the resolution of `result.value`, which could be different from the original `result.value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value.then(function (value) { return undefined; });
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.value.then(function (value) { return undefined; });` would return a promise for the resolution of `result.value`, but with a value of `undefined` instead of the original `result.value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value.then(function (value) { return Q.reject(new Error("Something went wrong")); });
```
This would result in
