  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor.hasOwnProperty(op)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `descriptor` object has the specified `op` property, rather than checking if it is a function. This would cause the `promiseDispatch` function to always throw an error, which would result in the promise being rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op in descriptor
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `op` property is in the `descriptor` object, rather than checking if it is a function. This would cause the `promiseDispatch` function to always throw an error, which would result in the promise being rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof descriptor[op] === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the value of the `descriptor[op]` property is a function, rather than checking if it is a function. This would cause the `
