  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/e/, 'i')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/e/` matches any letter "e" in the word, while in the original code fragment it replaces only the "a" after the "e".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
regex.replace(/a/, 'i')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace only the "a" after the "e", but in the original code fragment it replaces any letter "a" in the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(regex, 'ies')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace any occurrence of "a" with "ies", while in the original code fragment it replaces only the "a" after the "e".

DONE.
