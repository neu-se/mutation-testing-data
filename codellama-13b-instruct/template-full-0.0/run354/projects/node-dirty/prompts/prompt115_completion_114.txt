  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property returns the number of elements in an array, while the `size` property returns the number of key-value pairs in a Map object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.size + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `size` property returns the number of key-value pairs in a Map object, while the `size + 1` expression returns the number of key-value pairs plus one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.size - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `size` property returns the number of key-value pairs in a Map object, while the `size - 1` expression returns the number of key-value pairs minus one.

DONE.
