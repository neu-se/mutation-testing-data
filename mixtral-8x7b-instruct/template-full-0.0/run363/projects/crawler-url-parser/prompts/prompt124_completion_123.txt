 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
urlMap.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns an iterator, not an array. The `Array.from()` method would not be able to convert it, and the `map()` function would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
urlMap.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a iterator of keys, not an array of values. The `Array.from()` method would not be able to convert it, and the `map()` function would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
urlMap
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes the entire Map object to the `Array.from()` method, not just the values. The resulting array would contain Map objects instead of the expected objects with `url`, `text`, and `type` properties.

DONE.
