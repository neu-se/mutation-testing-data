  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
misc.map(Function.prototype.call, [])
```
This would result in different behavior because `misc` is a list of strings, and `Function.prototype.call` is a method that is meant to be called on a function, not a list.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
misc.filter(Boolean)
```
This would result in different behavior because `misc` is a list of strings, and `Boolean` is a function that returns `true` for all non-zero numbers and non-empty strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
misc.splice(0, misc.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because `misc` is a list of strings, and `splice` is a method that removes a specified number of elements from a list, starting from the first element.

DONE.
