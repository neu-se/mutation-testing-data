  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(policy) => [policy.name, policy.name]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `policy.name` property to be added to the map twice, which could lead to unexpected results when querying the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(policy) => [policy.name, policy.name.toUpperCase()]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `policy.name` property to be added to the map with a different case, which could lead to unexpected results when querying the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(policy) => [policy.name, policy.name.split('').reverse().join('')]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `policy.name` property to be added to the map with a reversed order, which could lead to unexpected results when querying the map.

DONE.
