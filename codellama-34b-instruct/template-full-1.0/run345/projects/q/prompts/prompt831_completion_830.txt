  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with a null value instead of a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with the value 42 instead of a promise.

DONE.
