Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons[at]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit the stack trace of the reason for the rejection instead of the promise itself, potentially leading to confusion about which promise was handled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit `null` instead of the promise, which means that the event listener for `rejectionHandled` would not have the promise reference, making it impossible to track which promise was handled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit `undefined` instead of the promise, which could lead to errors in any subsequent handling of the rejection, as the promise reference would be lost.

DONE.
