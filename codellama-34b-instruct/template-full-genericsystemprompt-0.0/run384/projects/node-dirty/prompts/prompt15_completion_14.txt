  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would not be called, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code that relies on the callback being called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be called with an undefined value, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code that relies on the callback being called with a specific value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be called with an empty function, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code that relies on the callback being called with a specific function.

DONE.
