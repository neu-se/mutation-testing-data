  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `2 * b`, which multiplies `b` by 2, while `2 * a` multiplies `a` by 2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `2 * b`, which multiplies `b` by 2, while `a + b` adds `a` and `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `2 * b`, which multiplies `b` by 2, while `a - b` subtracts `b` from `a`.

DONE.
