  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stripBom.call(this,content)
```
This would result in different behavior because `stripBom` is a method that expects to be called with a specific context `this`, which is not guaranteed to be the expected context when using `call`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fs.readFileSync(file,options)
```
This would result in different behavior because `readFileSync` is a method that reads and returns the file synchronously, whereas the original code uses `universalify.fromPromise` to read and return the file asynchronously.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(content,null,2))
```
This would result in different behavior because `stringify` and `parse` are used in a different order than the original code, which could result in different parse and stringify behavior.

DONE.
