Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of `options` would cause the `stringify` function to be called without any options, potentially leading to different serialization behavior or errors if `stringify` expects certain properties from `options`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because passing an empty object as `options` would mean that any specific options (like `replacer` or `space`) that might be needed for the `stringify` function are not provided, which could lead to unexpected output or formatting in the resulting string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ encoding: 'utf8' }
```
This would result in different behavior because providing a specific encoding option instead of the original `options` would change how the object is serialized, potentially leading to issues if the `stringify` function does not handle the encoding correctly or if the original `options` contained other important properties.

DONE.
