  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, regardless of the value of `predicate`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(<PLACEHOLDER> || false)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, regardless of the value of `predicate`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(<PLACEHOLDER> || <PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, regardless of the value of `predicate`.

DONE.
