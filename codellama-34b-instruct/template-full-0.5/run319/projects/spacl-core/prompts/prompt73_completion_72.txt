  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, ctx.verb, ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because the `verb` property of the `ctx` object is being used instead of the `verb` parameter, which could lead to different results in the `rule.query()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, ctx.path
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path` property of the `ctx` object is being used instead of the `path` parameter, which could lead to different results in the `rule.query()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, ctx.verb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `verb` property of the `ctx` object is being used instead of the `verb` parameter, which could lead to different results in the `rule.query()` method.

DONE.
