  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a new Delta object, while this replacement returns null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Delta();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a new Delta object with the inverted operations, while this replacement returns a new empty Delta object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Delta(this.ops);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a new Delta object with the inverted operations, while this replacement returns a new Delta object with the same operations as the original Delta object.

DONE.
