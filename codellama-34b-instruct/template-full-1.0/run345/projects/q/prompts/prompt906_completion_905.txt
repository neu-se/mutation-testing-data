  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!callback
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `callback` is `undefined`, whereas this modified code checks if `callback` is falsy (i.e., `null`, `undefined`, `0`, an empty string, etc.).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `callback` is `undefined`, whereas this modified code checks if `callback` is not `null` or `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof callback !== 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `callback` is `undefined`, whereas this modified code checks if `callback` is not a function.

DONE.
