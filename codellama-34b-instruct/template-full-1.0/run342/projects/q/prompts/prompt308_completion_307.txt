```
resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve()` is not a function in the context of the code, and would cause the code to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve()` is not a function in the context of the code, and would cause the code to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.deferred.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.deferred` is not a function in the context of the code, and would cause the code to throw an error.

DONE.
