Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror("An error occurred");
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of passing the caught error to the global error handler, it replaces it with a generic string message, which may lead to loss of the original error context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly passes the resolved value instead of the caught error to the error handler, which could lead to confusion and improper error handling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes a null value to the error handler, which may not be handled properly and could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes in the application.

DONE.
