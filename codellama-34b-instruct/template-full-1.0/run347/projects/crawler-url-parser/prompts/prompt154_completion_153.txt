  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)\/?$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the non-capturing group `(?:)` has been replaced with a capturing group `( )`, which would allow the regular expression to capture the last directory in the URL path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(.*)\/?$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match any character (including the forward slash) instead of just non-forward slash characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^/]*\/?$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match any character that is not a forward slash, including the forward slash at the end of the URL path.

DONE.
