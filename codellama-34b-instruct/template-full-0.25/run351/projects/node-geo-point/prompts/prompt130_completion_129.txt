  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a `GeoPoint` object, but `null` would cause a `TypeError` when trying to access its `latitude` and `longitude` properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a `GeoPoint` object, but `undefined` would cause a `TypeError` when trying to access its `latitude` and `longitude` properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a `GeoPoint` object, but `{}` is an empty object and would cause a `TypeError` when trying to access its `latitude` and `longitude` properties.

DONE.
