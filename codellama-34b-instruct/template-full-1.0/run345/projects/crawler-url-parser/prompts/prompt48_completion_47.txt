  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.format
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.format` returns a string representing the URL, while `URL.parse` returns an object containing the individual components of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
require('fs').readFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `require('fs').readFileSync` is a function that reads and returns the contents of a file, but it is not related to parsing or normalizing URLs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random` returns a random number between 0 and 1, which would not make sense in the context of URL parsing.

DONE.
