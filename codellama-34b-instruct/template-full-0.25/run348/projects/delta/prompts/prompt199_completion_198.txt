  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.rest()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.rest()` returns a new iterator that starts from the current position of `thisIter`, whereas `thisIter.rest` is a property that returns the remaining elements of `thisIter` as an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.rest()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.rest()` returns a new iterator that starts from the current position of `otherIter`, whereas `otherIter.rest` is a property that returns the remaining elements of `otherIter` as an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.peek()` returns the next element of `thisIter` without advancing the iterator, whereas `thisIter.rest` returns the remaining elements of `thisIter` as an array.

DONE.
