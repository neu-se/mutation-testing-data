  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to the `nbind` method would be passed as the `thisp` argument instead of the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument to the `nbind` method would be passed as the `thisp` argument instead of the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the fourth argument to the `nbind` method would be passed as the `thisp` argument instead of the first argument.

DONE.
