 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[read, ref[1], ref[0]]
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the order of the first two arguments, which could cause unintended side effects if the function being passed to `pull` relies on the order of its arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0] + ref[1]
