  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("Test error"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with an error, which would trigger the unhandled rejection tracking mechanism.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fulfill(123);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the value 123, which would not trigger the unhandled rejection tracking mechanism.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(function (value) {
    return value + 1;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with a function that increments the value by 1, which would not trigger the unhandled rejection tracking mechanism.

DONE.
