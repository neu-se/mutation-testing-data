  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op].call(promise, args)
```
This change will cause the `call` method to be called on the `descriptor[op]` function, which is not a valid method to call on a function. This will result in a `TypeError` being thrown, which will be caught by the `try-catch` block and the promise will be rejected with the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
