  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain && !op.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the attributes of the `op` object, which is not the intended behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain || op.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always retain the `op` object, regardless of whether it has attributes or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain && op.attributes.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only retain the `op` object if it has attributes with a length greater than 0.

DONE.
