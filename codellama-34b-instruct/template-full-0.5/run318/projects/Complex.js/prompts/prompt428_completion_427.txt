  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places && 0
```
This would result in different behavior because when `places` is `0`, the original code would return `0`, but the replaced code would return `1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places ^ 0
```
This would result in different behavior because when `places` is `0`, the original code would return `0`, but the replaced code would return `1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places ? 0 : 1
```
This would result in different behavior because when `places` is `0`, the original code would return `0`, but the replaced code would return `1`.

DONE.
