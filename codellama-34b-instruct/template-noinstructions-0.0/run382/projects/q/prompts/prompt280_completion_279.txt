  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a different function than `array_reduce`, and it would likely cause the code to fail or produce unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_reduce
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_reduce` is a different function than `array_slice`, and it would likely cause the code to fail or produce unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_map
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_map` is a different function than `array_reduce`, and it would likely cause the code to fail or produce unexpected results.

DONE.
