  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"line"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the string "line", regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"line" + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the string "line1", regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"line" * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the string "line" repeated twice, regardless of the input.

DONE.
