  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.message
```
This would result in different behavior because the `message` property of the `exception` object would be used instead of the `exception` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because a new `Error` object would be created with the `exception` object as the message, instead of using the `exception` object directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function would be called with the `exception` object as the argument, instead of using the `exception` object directly.

DONE.
