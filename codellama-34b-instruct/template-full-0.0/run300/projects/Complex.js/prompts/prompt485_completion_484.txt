  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `exports` is an object, while the new code fragment checks if `exports` is undefined. If `exports` is undefined, the new code fragment would evaluate to true, while the original code fragment would evaluate to false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `exports` is an object, while the new code fragment checks if `exports` is a string. If `exports` is a string, the new code fragment would evaluate to true, while the original code fragment would evaluate to false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `exports` is an object, while the new code fragment checks if `exports` is a number. If `exports` is a number, the new
