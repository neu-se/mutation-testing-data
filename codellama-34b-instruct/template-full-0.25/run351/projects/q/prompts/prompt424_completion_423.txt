  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the promise is fulfilled, but it would not check if the promise is pending.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the promise is pending, but it would not check if the promise is fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the promise is rejected, but it would not check if the promise is fulfilled or pending.

DONE.
