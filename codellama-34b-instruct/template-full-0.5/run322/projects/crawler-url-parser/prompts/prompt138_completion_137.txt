  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the last part of the URL path, while the new code fragment removes the entire path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, 'abc'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the last part of the URL path with a forward slash, while the new code fragment replaces it with the string 'abc'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '\\1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a backreference to replace the last part of the URL path with the first captured group, while the new code fragment uses a literal backslash followed by a 1.

DONE.
