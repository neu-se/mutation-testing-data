  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '/', 'g'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag is added, which makes the regular expression global, meaning it will match all occurrences in the string, not just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '/', 'i'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag is added, which makes the regular expression case-insensitive, meaning it will match both uppercase and lowercase letters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '/', 'm'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `m` flag is added, which makes the regular expression multi-line, meaning it will match the start and end of each line in the string, not just the start and end of the entire string.

DONE.
