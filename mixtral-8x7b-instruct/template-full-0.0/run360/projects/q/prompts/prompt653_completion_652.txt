 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"post", [name, 42]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` variable is replaced with a constant integer value, which changes the behavior of the `invoke` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"post", [null, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `name` variable is replaced with `null`, which changes the method being invoked on the `object`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"anotherMethod", [args]
```
This would result in different behavior because the method name is changed to `"anotherMethod"`, which does not exist, causing an error and changing the behavior of the `invoke` method.

DONE.
