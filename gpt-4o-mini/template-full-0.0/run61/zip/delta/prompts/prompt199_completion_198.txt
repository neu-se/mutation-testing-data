Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.ops
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the entire array of operations instead of the remaining operations after the current position, potentially leading to incorrect concatenation of operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.rest
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly references the `otherIter` iterator's remaining operations instead of the current iterator's remaining operations, which could lead to unexpected results in the final delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to retrieve the next operation with a length of 0, which would not return any operations and could lead to an empty delta being returned instead of the expected remaining operations.

DONE.
