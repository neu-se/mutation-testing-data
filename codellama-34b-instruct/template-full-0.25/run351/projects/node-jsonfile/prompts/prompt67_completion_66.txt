  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `''`, which is an empty string, while the new code fragment is a string containing a single space.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `''`, which is a falsy value, while the new code fragment is a truthy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `''`, which is a defined value, while the new code fragment is an undefined value.

DONE.
