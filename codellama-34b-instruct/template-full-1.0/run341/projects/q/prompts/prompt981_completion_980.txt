  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function and would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is a function that rejects the promise, whereas `deferred.makeNodeResolver` is a function that creates a new promise and passes it as an argument to the original function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve` is a function that creates a new resolved promise, whereas `deferred.makeNodeResolver` is a function that creates a new promise and passes it as an argument to the original function.

DONE.
