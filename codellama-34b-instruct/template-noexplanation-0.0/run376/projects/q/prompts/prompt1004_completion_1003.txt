  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This change will cause the `ninvoke` method to use the `get` method instead of the `post` method, which will result in a different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, nodeArgs, null]
```
This change will cause the `ninvoke` method to pass an extra argument to the `post` method, which will result in a different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, nodeArgs, function() {}]
```
This change will cause the `ninvoke` method to pass a function as the third argument to the `post` method, which will result in a different behavior.

DONE.
