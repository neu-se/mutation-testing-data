  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the case of the string, potentially causing the regex to not match.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split(" ")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first word of the stack line, potentially causing the regex to not match.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.replace("module.js", "node.js")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the module name in the stack line, potentially causing the regex to not match.

DONE.
