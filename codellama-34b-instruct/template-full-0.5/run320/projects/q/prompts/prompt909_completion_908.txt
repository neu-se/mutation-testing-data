  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would cause the `baseArgs` array to have one element, while the new code fragment would cause the `baseArgs` array to have two elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would cause the `baseArgs` array to have one element, while the new code fragment would cause the `baseArgs` array to have zero elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would cause the `baseArgs` array to have one element, while the new code fragment would cause the `baseArgs` array to have negative one element.

DONE.
