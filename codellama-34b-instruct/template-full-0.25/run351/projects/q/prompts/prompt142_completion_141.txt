  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise; !!p; p = p.source.value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the `value` property of the `source` object, which may not exist or have a different value than the original `source` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise; !!p; p = p.source.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `valueOf()` method of the `source` object, which may return a different value than the original `source` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise; !!p; p = p.source.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `toString()` method of the `source` object, which may return a different string representation than the original `source` object.

DONE.
