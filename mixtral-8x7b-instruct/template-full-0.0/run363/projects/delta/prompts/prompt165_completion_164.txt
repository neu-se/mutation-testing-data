 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always choose the `delete` type from `otherIter` instead of checking if the current type from `thisIter` matches the placeholder.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately invoke the `peekType` method, consuming the iterator. The original code uses `peekType` without parentheses, which only gets the reference to the function, allowing it to be used in the condition without invoking it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always choose the `insert` type from `thisIter` instead of checking if the current type from `otherIter` matches the placeholder.

DONE.
