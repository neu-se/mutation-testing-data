  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, iter.next(1).attributes || {}, i) === true
```
This change will cause the `eachLine` method to always return `true` for the predicate, which may cause the method to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, iter.next(1).attributes || {}, i) === false
```
This change will cause the `eachLine` method to always return `false` for the predicate, which may cause the method to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, iter.next(1).attributes || {}, i) === null
```
This change will cause the `eachLine` method to always return `null` for the predicate, which may cause the method to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
