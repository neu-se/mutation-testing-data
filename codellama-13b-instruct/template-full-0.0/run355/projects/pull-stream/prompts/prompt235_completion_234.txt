  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next(end, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` function is called with the `end` and `cb` arguments, which would cause the loop to terminate prematurely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is called with the `end` and `data` arguments, which would cause the loop to continue executing even if the `end` argument is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(end, function (end, data) {
  if (!end && !test(data)) {
    return sync ? loop = true : next(end, cb)
  }
  cb(end, data)
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function is called with the `end` and `function (end, data) { ... }` arguments, which would cause the loop to continue
