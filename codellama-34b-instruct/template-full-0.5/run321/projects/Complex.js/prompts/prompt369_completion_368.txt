  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function is different from the `sinh` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tanh
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tanh` function is different from the `sinh` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coth
```
This would result in different behavior because the `coth` function is different from the `sinh` function.

DONE.
