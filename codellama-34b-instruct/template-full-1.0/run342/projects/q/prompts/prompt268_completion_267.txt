  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(Card(value))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Card` function is not defined, and would result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(valued(value))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `valued` function is not defined, and would result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(Q(value twitter other))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` function is not defined, and would result in an error.

DONE.
