  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num !== 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both `num !== 1` and `num === undefined`, while the new code fragment only checks for `num !== 1`. This means that if `num` is undefined, the original code would return the plural form of the word, while the new code would return the singular form.

DONE.
