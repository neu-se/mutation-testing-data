  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"arguments"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `arguments` object, which is a special object that contains the arguments passed to a function. In this case, the `arguments` object is being used to forward the arguments to the `promiseDispatch` method. Replacing it with the string `"arguments"` would result in a different behavior because the string `"arguments"` is not a reference to the `arguments` object, and therefore would not be able to forward the arguments to the `promiseDispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"arguments[0]"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `arguments` object, which is a special object that contains the arguments passed to a function. In this case, the `arguments` object is being used to forward the arguments to the `promiseDispatch` method. Replacing it with the string `"arguments[0]"` would result in a different behavior because the string `"arguments[
