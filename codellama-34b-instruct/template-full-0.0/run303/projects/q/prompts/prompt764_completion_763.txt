  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(promise, onFulfilled, onRejected, onProgress);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onProgress` callback would not be called for the `promise` when it is resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(promise, onFulfilled, onRejected, onProgress).then(onFulfilled, onRejected, onProgress);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onProgress` callback would be called twice for the `promise` when it is resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(promise, onFulfilled, onRejected, onProgress).then(onFulfilled, onRejected);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onProgress` callback would not be called for the `promise` when it is rejected.

DONE.
