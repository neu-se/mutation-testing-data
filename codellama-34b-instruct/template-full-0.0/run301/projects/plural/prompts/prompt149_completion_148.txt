  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.prototype.plural = function(num) {
  return num > 1 ? this + 's' : this;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the plural form of the word, regardless of the number passed in.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.prototype.plural = function(num) {
  return num > 1 ? this + 's' : this + 'es';
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the plural form of the word, but with an extra 's' added to the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.prototype.plural = function(num) {
  return num > 1 ? this + 's' : this + 'ies';
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the plural form of the word, but with an extra 'ies' added to the
