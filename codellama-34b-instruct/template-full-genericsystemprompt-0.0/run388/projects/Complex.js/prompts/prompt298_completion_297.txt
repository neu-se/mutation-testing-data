  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the arctangent of `a` instead of `b`, which is the intended input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the arctangent of `b + 1` instead of `b`, which would change the output of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the arctangent of `-b` instead of `b`, which would change the output of the function.

DONE.
