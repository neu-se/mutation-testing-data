  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `pendingCount` is equal to 0, while this replacement checks if `pendingCount` is less than 0. This would cause the `onRejected` function to be called even if `pendingCount` is greater than 0, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `pendingCount` is equal to 0, while this replacement checks if `pendingCount` is greater than 0. This would cause the `onRejected` function to be called only if `pendingCount` is greater than 0, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `pendingCount` is
