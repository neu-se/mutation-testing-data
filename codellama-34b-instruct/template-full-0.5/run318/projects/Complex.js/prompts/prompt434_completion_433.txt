  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be dividing by 10 instead of 100, which would result in a different value for `places`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
9
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be dividing by 9 instead of 100, which would result in a different value for `places`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(10)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be dividing by the square root of 10 instead of 100, which would result in a different value for `places`.

DONE.
