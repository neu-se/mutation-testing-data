  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always call `op` with `data`, regardless of whether `end` is truthy or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!onEnd
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would only call `op` if `onEnd` is falsy, regardless of whether `end` is truthy or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd && end
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would only call `op` if both `onEnd` and `end` are truthy.

DONE.
