  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone.name
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the name of the timezone instead of the timezone object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!timezone.name
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the name of the timezone is falsy instead of the timezone object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone.name.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the length of the name of the timezone instead of the timezone object itself.

DONE.
