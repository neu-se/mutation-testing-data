  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.has
```
This change will cause the `matches` method to always return `false`, as `this.has` will always return `false` for a `PolicyMap` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(name)
```
This change will cause the `matches` method to always return `true`, as `this.get(name)` will always return a `Policy` object, which will evaluate to `true` in a boolean context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(name).query(path, verb, ctx)
```
This change will cause the `matches` method to always return the result of the `query` method of the `Policy` object with the given `name`, which may be different from the original behavior of the `matches` method.

DONE.
