 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trackRejection` function would always execute, even when unhandled rejection tracking is disabled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison uses the `===` operator, which checks for equality without type coercion. If `trackUnhandledRejections` is `null` or an empty string, the condition would evaluate to `false`, and the `trackRejection` function would not execute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
window.trackUnhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because it refers to the `trackUnhandledRejections` property of the `window` object, which may not exist or may have a different value than the local `trackUnhandledRejections` variable.

DONE.
