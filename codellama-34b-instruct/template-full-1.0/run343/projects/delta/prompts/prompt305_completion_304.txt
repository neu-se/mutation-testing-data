  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly check the truthiness of the line's length property instead of its actual length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly check if the length of the line is equal to 0 instead of testing if it's greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length() < 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly check if the length of the line is less than 1 instead of greater than 0.

DONE.
