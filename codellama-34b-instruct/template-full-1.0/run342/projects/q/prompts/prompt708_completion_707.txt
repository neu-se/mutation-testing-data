  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_keys
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_keys` returns the keys of an array, whereas `array_slice` returns the values of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_split
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_split` splits an array into chunks, whereas `array_slice` returns a portion of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_push
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_push` adds an element to the end of an array, whereas `array_slice` returns a portion of an array.

DONE.
