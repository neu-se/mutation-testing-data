  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(node.js:"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "node.js" string would not be present in the stack trace, and the code would not be able to detect whether the current frame is a Node frame or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(module.js:"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "module.js" string would not be present in the stack trace, and the code would not be able to detect whether the current frame is a module frame or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(myscript.js:"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "myscript.js" string would not be present in the stack trace, and the code would not be able to detect whether the current frame is a script frame or not.

DONE.
