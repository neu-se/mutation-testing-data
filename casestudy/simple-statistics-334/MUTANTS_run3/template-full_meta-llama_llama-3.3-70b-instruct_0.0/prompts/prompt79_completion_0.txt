Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because it would round down the left index to the nearest integer instead of up, potentially changing the range of elements considered for the quantile calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
indices[l] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would shift the left index by one position, altering the subset of the array that is being partially sorted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
r
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the right index instead of the left index, effectively changing the order in which the array is partially sorted and potentially leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
