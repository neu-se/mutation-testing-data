  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimRight().startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trimRight()` method removes whitespace from the right side of the string, whereas `trimLeft()` removes whitespace from the left side. This means that if the URL has whitespace on the right side, it will not be removed by the `trimRight()` method, and the `startsWith()` method will not detect it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.includes('://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `includes()` method checks if a string contains a specific substring, whereas `startsWith()` checks if a string starts with a specific substring. This means that if the URL does not contain the substring `://`, the `includes()` method will return `false`, whereas the `startsWith()` method will return `true` if the URL starts with `http` or `https`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.slice(0, 5) === 'https'
```
