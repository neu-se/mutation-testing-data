  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b + b * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the distributive property of multiplication over addition, while the replaced code fragment does not. Specifically, the replaced code fragment would calculate the sum of the products of `a` and `b`, rather than the product of the sums of `a` and `b`.
