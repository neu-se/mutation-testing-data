  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(end)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `once` function with the `end` argument, which would set the `a` variable to `true` and call the `onEnd` function with the `end` argument, even if the `read` function did not return an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `once` function with the `true` argument, which would set the `a` variable to `true` and call the `onEnd` function with no arguments, even if the `read` function did not return an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `once` function with the `false` argument, which would not set the `a` variable to `true` and would not call the `onEnd` function, even if the
