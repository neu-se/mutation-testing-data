  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, {}, i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` variable is not incremented, which would cause the `eachLine` method to loop indefinitely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, {}, i - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` variable is decremented, which would cause the `eachLine` method to loop indefinitely in the opposite direction.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, {}, i * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` variable is multiplied by 2, which would cause the `eachLine` method to skip every other line.

DONE.
