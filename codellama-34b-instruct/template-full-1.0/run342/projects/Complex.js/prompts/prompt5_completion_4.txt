  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Placeholder.ofType(a.getClass())()```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `Placeholder` class to get the type of `a`, and then create a new instance of that type. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the `Placeholder` class is not implemented correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```TypeConfiguration.converter(a.getClass()).convertTo(a.toString())```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `TypeConfiguration` class to get a converter function for the type of `a`, and then use that function to convert `a` to a string. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the `TypeConfiguration` class is not implemented correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Utilities.parseNumeric(a.toString())```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `Utilities` class to parse `a` as a numeric value. This could lead to unexpected behavior if `a
