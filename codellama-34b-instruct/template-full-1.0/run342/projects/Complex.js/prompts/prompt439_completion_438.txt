  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be computing the modulus of the imaginary part instead of the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * places + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be adding the real and imaginary parts instead of the real part only.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b / places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be subtracting the imaginary part from the real part divided by the modulus instead of the real part only.

DONE.
