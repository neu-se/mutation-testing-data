  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`&& other.ops.length === 0;`
```
This would result in different behavior because with the original code, if `other.ops.length` is greater than 0, the `if` statement would evaluate to true and the code inside the block would be executed. However, with the new code fragment, if `other.ops.length` is greater than 0, the `if` statement would evaluate to false and the code inside the block would not be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`&& other.ops.length < 0;`
```
This would result in different behavior because with the original code, if `other.ops.length` is greater than 0, the `if` statement would evaluate to true and the code inside the block would be executed. However, with the new code fragment, if `other.ops.length` is less than 0, the `if` statement would evaluate to true and the code inside the block would be executed.
