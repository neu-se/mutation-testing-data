  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFileSync` is a synchronous function that writes the file to disk and returns nothing, while `fs.writeFile` is an asynchronous function that writes the file to disk and returns a promise that resolves when the file has been written.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFile.bind(fs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFile.bind(fs)` is a bound function that returns a new function that is bound to the `fs` object, while `fs.writeFile` is an unbound function that is not bound to any object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFile.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFile.bind(null)` is a bound function that returns a new function that is bound to `null`, while `fs.writeFile` is an un
