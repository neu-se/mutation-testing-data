 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places
```
This would result in different behavior because the default value of 10 is not used when `places` is provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(2, places || 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the base of the exponentiation is changed to 2, which can lead to different results in rounding.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places * Math.log(10)
```
This would result in different behavior because the value is calculated by taking the natural logarithm of 10, raised to the power of `places`, instead of using exponentiation directly.

DONE.
