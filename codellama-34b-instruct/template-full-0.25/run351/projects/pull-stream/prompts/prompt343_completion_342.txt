  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === true ? null : abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` is a boolean value, but the new code fragment `abort === true ? null : abort` is a ternary expression that evaluates to either `null` or `abort`, depending on the value of `abort`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort !== true ? null : abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` is a boolean value, but the new code fragment `abort !== true ? null : abort` is a ternary expression that evaluates to either `null` or `abort`, depending on the value of `abort`.
