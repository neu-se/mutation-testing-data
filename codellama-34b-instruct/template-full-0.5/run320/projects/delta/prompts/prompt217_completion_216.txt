  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first op in the other delta, which could cause the composition to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last op in the other delta, which could cause the composition to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(0).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the ops in the other delta, which could cause the composition to be incorrect.

DONE.
