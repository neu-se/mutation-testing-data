  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, so it would throw an error when called with `apply`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, so it would throw an error when called with `apply`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the global object, which is not a function, so it would throw an error when called with `apply`.

DONE.
