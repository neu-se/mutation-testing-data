  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cork()` method is used to pause the writing of data to the write stream, whereas the original code uses `uncork()` to resume writing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write('');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `write()` method is used to write data to the write stream, whereas the original code uses `uncork()` to resume writing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `write()` method is used to write data to the write stream, whereas the original code uses `uncork()` to resume writing.

DONE.
