  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.put
```
This would result in different behavior because `put` is a method that adds a new value to the promise's resolution queue, while `get` is a method that retrieves the current value of the promise. Using `put` instead of `get` would cause the `get` method to return a promise that is not yet resolved, which would result in the `fail` method being called with an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a method that rejects the promise with a specified error, while `get` is a method that retrieves the current value of the promise. Using `reject` instead of `get` would cause the `get` method to return a promise that is rejected with an error, which would result in the `fail` method being called with the same error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.prom
