  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a, b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` and `b` have different values in the context of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b, a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` and `b` have different values in the context of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a + b` has a different value than `b, a`.

DONE.
