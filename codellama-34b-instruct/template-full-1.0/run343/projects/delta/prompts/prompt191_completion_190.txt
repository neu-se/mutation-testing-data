  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
      otherOp;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `newOp` object to be overwritten with the `otherOp` object, which could potentially lead to unintended consequences in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
      null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the program to return a `null` value instead of a `Delta` object, which could cause errors or unexpected behavior during execution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
      0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the program to return a `0` value instead of a `Delta` object, which could cause errors or unexpected behavior during execution.

DONE.
