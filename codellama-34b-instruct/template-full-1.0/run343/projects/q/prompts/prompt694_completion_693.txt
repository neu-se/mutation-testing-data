  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.get()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.get()` would return the promise's resolved value, rather than the promise itself, which could break the code that relies on the promise object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise[0]` would access the first element of the promise, rather than the promise itself, which could break the code that relies on the promise object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(promise())
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve(promise())` would create a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the `promise()` function, rather than the promise itself, which could break the code that relies on the promise object.

DONE.
