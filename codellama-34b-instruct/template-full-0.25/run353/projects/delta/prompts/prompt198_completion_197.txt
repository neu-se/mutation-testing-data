  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 2], newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the second-to-last operation in the delta with the new operation, rather than the last operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[0], newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the first operation in the delta with the new operation, rather than the last operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[Math.floor(delta.ops.length / 2)], newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the middle operation in the delta with the new operation, rather than the last operation.

DONE.
