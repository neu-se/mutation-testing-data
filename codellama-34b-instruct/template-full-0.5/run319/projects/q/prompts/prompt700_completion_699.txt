  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a shallow copy of the array, whereas `concat()` returns a new array that contains the values of the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.splice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice()` modifies the original array, whereas `concat()` returns a new array that contains the values of the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.map()
```
This would result in different behavior because `map()` returns a new array that contains the values of the original array, transformed by the function passed as an argument.

DONE.
