 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the final regex pattern will not include the '^' character at the beginning, changing the regex to match any string instead of only the beginning of a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
min > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the final regex pattern will include an additional '/[^/]+' segment, causing it to match a different set of strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
min + max
```
This would result in different behavior because the final regex pattern will include an additional '/[^/]+' segment, causing it to match a different set of strings.

DONE.
