  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isGlob
```
This code fragment will negate the result of the `isGlob` function, which means that if the `src` variable is a glob, the `zipArchive.glob` method will not be called, and the `zipArchive.directory` method will be called instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob && false
```
This code fragment will always evaluate to `false`, which means that the `zipArchive.glob` method will never be called, and the `zipArchive.directory` method will always be called instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob || true
```
This code fragment will always evaluate to `true`, which means that the `zipArchive.glob` method will always be called, and the `zipArchive.directory` method will never be called.

DONE.
