  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the path to lowercase, which could potentially cause the `matches()` method to return a different result than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring()` method would return a substring of the path starting from the second character, which could potentially cause the `matches()` method to return a different result than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method would split the path into an array of substrings using '/' as the separator, and the `pop()` method would return the last element of the array, which could potentially cause the `matches()` method to return a different result than the original code fragment.

DONE.
