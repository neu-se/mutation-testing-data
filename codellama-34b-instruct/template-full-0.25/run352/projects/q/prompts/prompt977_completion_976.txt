  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer()` is a function call, whereas `defer` is a variable reference.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred` is a variable reference, whereas `defer()` is a function call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer.resolve()` is a function call, whereas `defer` is a variable reference.

DONE.
