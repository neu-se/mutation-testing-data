  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.ops.length;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the length of the `ops` array, regardless of the actual length of the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.ops.reduce((length, op) => length + Op.length(op), 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would correctly calculate the length of the delta by iterating over the `ops` array and summing up the lengths of each operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.ops.reduce((length, op) => length + Op.length(op), 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would correctly calculate the length of the delta by iterating over the `ops` array and summing up the lengths of each operation.

DONE.
