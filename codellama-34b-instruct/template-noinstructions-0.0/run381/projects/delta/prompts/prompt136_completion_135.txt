  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek` method is not being called with the correct argument. The `peek` method expects a number as its argument, but `<PLACEHOLDER>` is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek` method is not being called with the correct argument. The `peek` method expects a number as its argument, but `<PLACEHOLDER>` is a string.
