  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` and `push` are different methods of the `Delta` class, and `insert` would insert the given string at the current position, while `push` would add it to the end of the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.retain(otherOp.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` and `push` are different methods of the `Delta` class, and `retain` would retain the given length, while `push` would add the given operation to the end of the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.delete(otherOp.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` and `push` are different methods of the `Delta` class, and `delete` would delete the given length, while `push` would add the given operation to the end of the delta.
