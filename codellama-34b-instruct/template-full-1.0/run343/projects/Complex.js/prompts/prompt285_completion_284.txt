  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Complex(
    Math.cos(b) * cosh(a),
    Math.sin(b) * sinh(a));
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments to `cos` and `sin` are reversed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Complex(
    Math.cos(a + b),
    Math.sin(a + b));
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` and `b` are added instead of `a` and `b` multiplied.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Complex(
    Math.cos(a) * cosh(b),
    Math.sin(a) * sinh(b));
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments to `cos` and `sin` are swapped.

DONE.
