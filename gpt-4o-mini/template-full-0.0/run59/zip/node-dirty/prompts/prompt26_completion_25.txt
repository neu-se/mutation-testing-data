Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(new Error('Write failed'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it simulates a failure during the write operation, causing the callback to receive an error instead of `undefined`, which may not be handled by the calling code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it indicates that the write operation was successful, but it does not provide the expected behavior of returning `undefined`, which could lead to confusion in the calling code that expects a different response.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb('Success');
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the type of the callback's argument from `undefined` to a string, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that processes the callback, as it may not be designed to handle a string response.

DONE.
