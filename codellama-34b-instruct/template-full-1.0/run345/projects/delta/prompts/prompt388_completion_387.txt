  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(Other.length, AttributeMap.transform(thisOp.attributes, otherOp.attributes, priority));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the length of the other delta, rather than the length of the current delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(this.ops[i].insert);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the insert operation of the current delta to the new delta, rather than the other delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Inverted.push(delta.slice(i, i + 1));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new delta that contains the inverted values of the current delta, rather than the other delta.

DONE.
