  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to check the other `Delta` object for the presence of additional operations, instead of checking the current `Delta` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.nextIndex < this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to check if there are any more operations in the current `Delta` object, instead of checking the `other` `Delta` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to check if there are any more operations in the `other` `Delta` object, instead of checking the current `Delta` object.

DONE.
