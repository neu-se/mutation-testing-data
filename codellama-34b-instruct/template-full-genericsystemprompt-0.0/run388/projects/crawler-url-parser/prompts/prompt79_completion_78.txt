  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'b'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be selecting all elements with the tag name "b" instead of "a".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'a[href]'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be selecting all elements with the tag name "a" that have an "href" attribute, instead of all elements with the tag name "a".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'a:not([href])'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be selecting all elements with the tag name "a" that do not have an "href" attribute, instead of all elements with the tag name "a".

DONE.
