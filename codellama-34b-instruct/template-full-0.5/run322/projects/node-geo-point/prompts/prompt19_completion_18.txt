  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isObject && !Array.isArray(point.coordinates)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `point` is an object and has a `coordinates` property, but this new code fragment would also check if `point.coordinates` is not an array, which would cause the `fromGeoJSON` method to throw a `TypeError` if `point.coordinates` is an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isObject && !point.coordinates.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `point` is an object and has a `coordinates` property, but this new code fragment would also check if `point.coordinates` has a length of zero, which would cause the `fromGeoJSON` method to throw a `TypeError` if `point.coordinates` is not an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isObject && point.
