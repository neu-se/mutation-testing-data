  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id, options
```
This would result in different behavior because the `id` and `options` parameters are reversed, which could cause the `getCountry` function to return incorrect country data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options, id
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options` parameter is now the first parameter, which could cause the `getCountry` function to interpret the `id` parameter as an option.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id + 1, options
```
This would result in different behavior because the `id` parameter is now incremented by 1, which could cause the `getCountry` function to return incorrect country data.

DONE.
