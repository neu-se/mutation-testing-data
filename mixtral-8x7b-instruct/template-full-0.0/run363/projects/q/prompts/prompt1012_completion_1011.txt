 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new deferred object with the default settler function, which doesn't reject the promise even if an error occurs. The original code uses `defer(<PLACEHOLDER>)` to pass a custom error-handling settler function to the `defer` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates an empty function instead of the `makeNodeResolver` function. The `makeNodeResolver` function is responsible for handling Node.js-style callbacks and resolving or rejecting the promise accordingly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly calls the `resolve` method instead of creating a new resolver function with `deferred.makeNodeResolver()`. This would cause the promise to be immediately resolved with `undefined` instead of
