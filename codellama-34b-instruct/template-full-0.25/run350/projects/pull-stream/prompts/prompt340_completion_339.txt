  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operation would change the value of `data`, potentially causing the `seen` object to be updated with a different key than the one intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of `data` would be used as the key for the `seen` object, potentially causing the `seen` object to be updated with a different key than the one intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method of `data` would be called, potentially causing the `seen` object to be updated with a different key than the one intended.

DONE.
