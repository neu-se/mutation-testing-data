 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1/Math.E
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the reciprocal of the mathematical constant e (approximately 0.3679) instead of the natural logarithm of the absolute value of b.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.log10(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the base-10 logarithm of the absolute value of b instead of the natural logarithm.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(b) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the absolute value of b minus 1, instead of calculating the natural logarithm of the absolute value of b.

DONE.
