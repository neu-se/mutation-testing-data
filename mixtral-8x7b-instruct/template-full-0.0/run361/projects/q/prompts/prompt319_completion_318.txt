 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `result` would always be set to `false` instead of invoking the descriptor method, potentially causing the promise to resolve or reject incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
descriptor['op']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would look for a property with the literal string 'op' instead of using the value of the `op` variable, causing the promise to resolve or reject incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always resolve the promise, even if the descriptor method should reject it, causing incorrect behavior in the application.

DONE.
