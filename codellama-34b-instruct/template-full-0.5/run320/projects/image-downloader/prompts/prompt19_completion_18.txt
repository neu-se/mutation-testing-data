  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isAbsolute(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the destination path is not absolute, while this replacement checks if it is absolute. This change would cause the code to take a different branch and potentially result in a different outcome.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!path.isAbsolute(options.dest) && path.extname(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the destination path is not absolute, while this replacement checks if it is not absolute and has an extension. This change would cause the code to take a different branch and potentially result in a different outcome.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the destination path is not absolute, while this replacement checks if the basename of the destination path is not the empty string. This change would
