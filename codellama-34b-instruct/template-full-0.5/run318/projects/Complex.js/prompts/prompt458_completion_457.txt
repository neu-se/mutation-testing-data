  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` function checks if the number is Not-a-Number, while the `isInfinite` function checks if the number is Infinite. Using `isNaN` instead of `isInfinite` would cause the `toString` method to return a different value for Infinite numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isFinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite` function checks if the number is Finite, while the `!` operator negates the result. Using `!this['isFinite']()` instead of `this['isInfinite']()` would cause the `toString` method to return a different value for Finite numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the `re` property refers to the real part of the complex number
