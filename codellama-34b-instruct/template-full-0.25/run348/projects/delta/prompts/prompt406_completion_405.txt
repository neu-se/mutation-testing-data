  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType + '1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would concatenate the `embedType` string with the string `'1'`, resulting in a different string than the original `embedType` string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the `embedType` string to uppercase, resulting in a different string than the original `embedType` string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property would return the length of the `embedType` string, which would be a different value than the original `embedType` string.

DONE.
