  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimRight().startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `trimRight()` removes characters from the end of the string, rather than the beginning, making the test more likely to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.toLowerCase().startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `toLowerCase()` converts the string to lowercase, making the test more likely to fail if the string contains uppercase characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.includes('http')
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes()` checks if the string contains the given substring, regardless of its position, making the test more likely to fail if the URL does not contain the substring 'http'.

DONE.
