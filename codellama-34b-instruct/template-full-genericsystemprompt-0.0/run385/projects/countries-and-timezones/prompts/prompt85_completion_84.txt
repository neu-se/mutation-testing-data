  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = true;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the deprecated timezones, even if the `deprecated` option is set to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = !options.deprecated;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the `deprecated` option, which could cause the function to return the opposite of what it's supposed to.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = options.deprecated ? false : true;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `deprecated` option to `false` if it's currently `true`, and vice versa.

DONE.
