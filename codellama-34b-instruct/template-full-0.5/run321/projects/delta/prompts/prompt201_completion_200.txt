  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat(rest).chop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `chop` method on the result of `concat`, which is a `Delta` object. However, in this option, the `chop` method is called on the `rest` object, which is a `Delta` object. This could result in different behavior if the `chop` method has a different implementation for `Delta` objects than for `Op` objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat(rest).compose(delta)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `compose` method on the result of `concat`, which is a `Delta` object. However, in this option, the `compose` method is called on the `rest` object, which is a `Delta` object. This could result in different behavior if the `compose` method has a different implementation for `Delta` objects than for `Op` objects.

Option 3: The
