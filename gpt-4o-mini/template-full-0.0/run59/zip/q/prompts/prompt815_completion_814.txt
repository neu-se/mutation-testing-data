Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code attempts to recycle the rejection with "this", while using `undefined` would cause the callback to be called without any context, potentially leading to unhandled promise rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of the original context would mean that the callback is executed without the expected promise context, which could lead to unexpected results or errors in the callback execution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Error"
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing the placeholder with a string would cause the callback to be called with a string instead of the original promise context, which could lead to incorrect handling of the rejection and potentially throw an error that is not related to the original promise.

DONE.
