  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the value of `i` instead of incrementing it, which could lead to an infinite loop if `i` becomes negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not modify the value of `i` and would always evaluate to the value of `i` incremented by 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 2 to the value of `i` instead of incrementing it by 1, which could lead to a difference in the number of iterations of the loop.

DONE.
