  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would cause the value of `read` to be incremented, potentially changing the outcome of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would cause the value of `read` to be doubled, potentially changing the outcome of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator would cause the value of `read` to be decremented, potentially changing the outcome of the function.

DONE.
