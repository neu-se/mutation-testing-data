  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math. Pirate
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.Pirate()` is not a valid function and would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(b, a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan2(b, a)` is a valid function that returns the arctangent of `b/a`, which is different from the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(b*b + a*a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt(b*b + a*a)` is a valid function that returns the square root of `b*b + a*a`, which is different from the original code fragment.

DONE.
