  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error != null
```
This would result in different behavior because `error` is not a boolean value, so the comparison `error != null` will always be true, even if `error` is not an error object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.message !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `error.message` is a string, so the comparison `error.message !== null` will always be true, even if `error` is not an error object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.name !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `error.name` is a string, so the comparison `error.name !== null` will always be true, even if `error` is not an error object.

DONE.
