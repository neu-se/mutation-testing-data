  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value in JavaScript, and it would be passed as an argument to `rejected` if the promise is rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a valid value in JavaScript, and it would be passed as an argument to `rejected` if the promise is rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a valid value in JavaScript, and it would be passed as an argument to `rejected` if the promise is rejected.

DONE.
