  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This change will cause the regular expression to match a backslash character instead of a dollar sign, which is likely to cause a syntax error in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\\\'
```
This change will cause the regular expression to match a backslash character followed by a dollar sign, which is likely to cause a syntax error in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\$'
```
This change will cause the regular expression to match a dollar sign character, which is likely to cause a syntax error in the code.

DONE.
