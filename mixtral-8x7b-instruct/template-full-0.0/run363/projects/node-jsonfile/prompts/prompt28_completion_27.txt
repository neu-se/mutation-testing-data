 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the error thrown when JSON parsing fails will not have its message prepended with the file name, and the error will always be thrown regardless of the 'throws' option.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.shouldThrow
```
This would result in different behavior because the error thrown when JSON parsing fails will not have its message prepended with the file name if 'shouldThrow' is not explicitly set to true in the options object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.throws !== undefined ? options.throws : true
```
This would result in different behavior because the error thrown when JSON parsing fails will not have its message prepended with the file name if 'throws' is explicitly set to false in the options object.

DONE.
