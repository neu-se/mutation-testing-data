  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp, arguments + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object would be shifted by 1, potentially causing the callback to be called with the wrong arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp, arguments.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments.length` property would be incremented by 1, potentially causing the callback to be called with an extra argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp, arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object would be accessed at index 0, potentially causing the callback to be called with the wrong argument.

DONE.
