  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof b !== 'function'
```
This change will cause the `diff` function to return a different result when `b` is a function, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof b !== 'undefined'
```
This change will cause the `diff` function to return a different result when `b` is undefined, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof b !== 'object' && typeof b !== 'function'
```
This change will cause the `diff` function to return a different result when `b` is neither an object nor a function, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
