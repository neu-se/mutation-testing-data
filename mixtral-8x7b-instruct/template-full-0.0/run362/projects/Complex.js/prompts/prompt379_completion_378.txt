 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because the hyperbolic cosine function (Math.cosh) is used instead of the regular cosine function (Math.cos), which would produce incorrect results for complex numbers with an imaginary component.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
