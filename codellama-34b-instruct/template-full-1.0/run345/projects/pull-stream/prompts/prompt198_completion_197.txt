  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function immediately, whereas the original code fragment would only call `cb` if the `abort` flag was set.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only call `cb` if the `abort` flag was set, whereas the original code fragment would call `cb` regardless of the value of `abort`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
busy || cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `cb` if the `busy` flag was set, whereas the original code fragment would only call `cb` if the `abort` flag was set.

DONE.
