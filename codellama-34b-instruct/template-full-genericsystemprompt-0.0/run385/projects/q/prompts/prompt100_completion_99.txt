  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the index is greater than the length of the array, which would always be false, and the code would never enter the loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the index is less than the length of the array, which would always be true, and the code would enter an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index === this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the index is equal to the length of the array, which would always be false, and the code would never enter the loop.

DONE.
