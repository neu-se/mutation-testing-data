  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promises).allSettled(false);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allSettled` method should be called on an array of promises, not a boolean value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promises).allSettled(array_map(promises, function (promise) {
        return when(promise, noop, noop);
    }));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allSettled` method should be called on an array of promises, not an array of functions that return promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promises).allSettled([Q(promises)]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allSettled` method should be called on an array of promises, not an array containing a single promise.

DONE.
