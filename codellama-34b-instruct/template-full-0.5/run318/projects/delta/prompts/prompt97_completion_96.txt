  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method expects the second argument to be the number of elements to remove, but `0` would remove no elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method expects the second argument to be an integer greater than or equal to 0, but `-1` would result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method expects the second argument to be the number of elements to remove, but `this.ops.length` would remove all elements.

DONE.
