  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Test error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function would throw an error, causing the promise to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.resolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function would return a resolved promise, causing the promise to be resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(new Error("Test error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function would return a rejected promise, causing the promise to be rejected.

DONE.
