  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl = parse(pageurl);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pageurl` variable is now a parsed URL object instead of a string. This could cause issues if the `gettype` function is expecting a string as input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof pageurl == "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator is now checking if the `pageurl` variable is an object, which could be true if it is a parsed URL object. This could cause issues if the `gettype` function is expecting a string as input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.host == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pageurl.host` property is now being checked for null, which could cause issues if the `pageurl` variable is a parsed URL object and the `host` property is not null. This could also cause issues if the `gettype` function is expecting a
