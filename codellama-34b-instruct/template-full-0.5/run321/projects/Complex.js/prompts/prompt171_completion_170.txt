  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this.isZero() && z.isZero()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.isZero()` and `z.isZero()` are not equivalent to `this['isZero']() && z['isZero']()`. The former is a method call, while the latter is a property access.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this.isInfinite() || z.isInfinite()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.isInfinite()` and `z.isInfinite()` are not equivalent to `this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()`. The former is a method call, while the latter is a property access.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (a === 0 && b === 0 && z.re > 0 && z.im >= 0) {
```
This would result in different behavior because `a === 0 && b ===
