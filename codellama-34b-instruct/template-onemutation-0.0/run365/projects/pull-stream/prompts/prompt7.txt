Your task is to apply mutation testing to the following code:
```
'use strict'

var sources  = require('./sources')
var sinks    = require('./sinks')
var throughs = require('./throughs')

exports = module.exports = require('./pull')

exports.pull = exports

for(var k in sources)
  exports[k] = sources[k]

for(var k in throughs)
  exports[k] = throughs[k]

for(<PLACEHOLDER> in sinks)
  exports[k] = sinks[k]


```

by replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different
behavior than the original code fragment, which was:
```
var k
```
Please consider changes such as using different operators, changing constants,
referring to different variables, object properties, functions, or methods.  

Provide your answer as a fenced code block containing a single line of code,
using the following template:

The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Please conclude your response with "DONE."
