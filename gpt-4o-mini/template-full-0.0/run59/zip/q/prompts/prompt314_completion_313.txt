Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately reject the promise without waiting for any of the promises in the race to settle, leading to a promise that is always rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(resolve, reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to resolve or reject based on the current promise's state instead of racing against the provided promises, effectively ignoring the race condition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve("default value");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with a static value ("default value") regardless of the outcomes of the promises being raced, thus not reflecting the actual result of the race.

DONE.
