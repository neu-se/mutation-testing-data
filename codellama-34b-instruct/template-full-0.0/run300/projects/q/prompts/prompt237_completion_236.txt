  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the length of the `messages` array instead of checking if it is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the first element of the `messages` array instead of checking if it is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last element of the `messages` array instead of checking if it is undefined.

DONE.
