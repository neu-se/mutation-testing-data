 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method should modify the property of the target object, but this change would always set the property to `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.when(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when` treats its argument as a promise and returns a promise that is resolved with the value of the argument if it is not a promise, or with the resolved value of the argument if it is a promise. In this case, it would always set the property to `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject(new Error('Rejection'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise returned by the `set` method instead of resolving it with the specified value.

DONE.
