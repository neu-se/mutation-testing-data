 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `this` would be `null` instead of the expected object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
window
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `this` would be the `window` object (in a browser environment) instead of the expected object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `this` would be a random number instead of the expected object. This is because `Math.random()` returns a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).

DONE.
