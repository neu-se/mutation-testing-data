  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp.attributes` could be an object, but `null` is a primitive value that is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp.attributes` could be an object, but `undefined` is a primitive value that is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes !== {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp.attributes` could be an object, but `{}` is an empty object that is not the same as `newOp.attributes`.

DONE.
