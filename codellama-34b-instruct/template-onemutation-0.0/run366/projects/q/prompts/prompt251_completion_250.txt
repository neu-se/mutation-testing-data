  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Q.longStackSupport || !hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is used to negate the `Q.longStackSupport` and `hasStacks` variables, which would cause the `become` function to be called with a different value for `newPromise`, potentially leading to a different execution path.

DONE.
