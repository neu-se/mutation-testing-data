  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/b/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match a different character than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/a|b/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match either the 'a' or 'b' character, whereas the original code fragment only matches the 'a' character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^a]/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any character other than 'a', whereas the original code fragment only matches the 'a' character.

DONE.
