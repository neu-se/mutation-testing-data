  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type !== 'Point'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromGeoJSON` method would throw a `TypeError` if the `type` property of the `point` object is not `'Point'`, whereas the original code would throw a `TypeError` if the `type` property is not present.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray(point.coordinates) || point.coordinates.length !== 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromGeoJSON` method would throw a `TypeError` if the `coordinates` property of the `point` object is not an array with two elements, whereas the original code would throw a `TypeError` if the `coordinates` property is not present.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type === 'Point' && !Array.isArray(point.coordinates)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `
