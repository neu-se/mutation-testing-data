 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the callback with two arguments (end and data), while the modified fragment only passes the data argument. This could cause issues if the test suite expects the callback to be called with two arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the callback with two arguments (end and data), while the modified fragment only passes a boolean value. This could cause issues if the test suite expects the callback to be called with two arguments, or if it expects the first argument to be a boolean value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the callback, while the modified fragment logs the data to the console. This could cause issues if the test suite expects the callback to be called, or if it expects the data to
