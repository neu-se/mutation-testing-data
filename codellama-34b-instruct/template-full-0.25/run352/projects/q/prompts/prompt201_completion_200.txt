  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\t"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string concatenation would use a tab character instead of a newline character, which could cause the stack trace to be formatted differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "
```
This would result in different behavior because the string concatenation would use a space character instead of a newline character, which could cause the stack trace to be formatted differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string concatenation would use a backslash followed by an "n" character instead of a newline character, which could cause the stack trace to be formatted differently.

DONE.
