  Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("some error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` would not be called with `reason` as its argument. Instead, the promise would be rejected with a different error.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
return reject("some different reason")
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` would be called with a different reason than the one passed to the `reject` function in the original code.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
return fulfill("some different value")
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fulfill` would be called with a different value than the one passed to the `fulfill` function in the original code.

DONE.
