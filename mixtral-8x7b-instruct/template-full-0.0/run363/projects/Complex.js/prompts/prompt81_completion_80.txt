 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
c === '⁻'
```
This would result in different behavior because the character '⁻' is not a valid minus sign in JavaScript, and the condition would always be false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
c === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable `c` is expected to be a string, and the condition would always be false if `c` is a non-zero string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
c.charCodeAt(0) === 45
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the character code of `c` is equal to 45, which is the ASCII code for the minus sign, but not the hyphen-minus character used in JavaScript strings. This could lead to false negatives or false positives depending on the input.

DONE.
