  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(this, prop)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `call` method to bind the `this` context to the `hasOwnProperty` function, which would cause the function to be called on the `Object.prototype` object instead of the `object_hasOwnProperty` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.bind(this)

This would result in different behavior because it would use the `bind` method to create a new function that is bound to the `this` context, which would cause the function to be called on the `Object.prototype` object instead of the `object_hasOwnProperty` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.apply(this, [prop])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `apply` method to call the
