Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
message.concat("extra")
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to concatenate the string "extra" to the message array, which would change the arguments passed to `newPromise.promiseDispatch`, potentially causing unexpected behavior in promise resolution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
message[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it only passes the first element of the `message` array to `newPromise.promiseDispatch`, which may not include all necessary arguments for proper promise handling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes `undefined` to `newPromise.promiseDispatch`, which would likely cause the promise to fail or behave incorrectly, as it would not receive the expected arguments.

DONE.
