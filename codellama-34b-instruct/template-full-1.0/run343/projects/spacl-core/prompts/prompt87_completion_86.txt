  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.clone(...this.rules)
```
This would result in an infinite loop because the `clone` method would call itself recursively until the call stack exceeds the maximum allowed size.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Rule('allow', 'GET', '/.*/')
```
This would result in a different behavior because the new rule would allow all GET requests to pass, despite the fact that the `push` method is only intended to add new rules to the policy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.push(...this.rules)
```
This would result in a different behavior because the `push` method would add all the rules in the policy to itself, effectively doubling the number of rules in the policy.

DONE.
