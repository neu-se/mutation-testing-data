Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.endsWith(pageurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return "uplevel" instead of "sublevel" when the link URL is a subdirectory of the page URL, and "samelevel" instead of "internal
