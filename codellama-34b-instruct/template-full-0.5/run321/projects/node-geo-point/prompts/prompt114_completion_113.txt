  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` and `Math.cos` have different return values, and the code that uses the result of the `Math.cos` call would behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a constant value that represents the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, and using it in place of `Math.cos` would cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` returns a random number between 0 and 1, and using it in place of `Math.cos` would cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
