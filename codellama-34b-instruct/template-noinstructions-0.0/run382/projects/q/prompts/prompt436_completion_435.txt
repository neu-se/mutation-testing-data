  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.includes(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` checks if the array contains the given element, whereas `array_indexOf` checks if the element is present at a specific index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.indexOf(promise) > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` returns the index of the element if it is present, and -1 if it is not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.includes(promise) && unhandledReasons.includes(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if both the promise and the reason are present in their respective arrays.

DONE.
