  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
7
```
This would result in different behavior because it would start the slice at the seventh character of the string, rather than the eighth.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10
```
This would result in different behavior because it would go ten characters beyond the end of the string, potentially resulting in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the entire string, rather than a slice of it.

DONE.
