  Official Answer:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.resolve` would be called directly, instead of being dispatched through the `Q` constructor as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fulfill
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.fulfill` is not a valid method of a `Promise` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected, instead of resolved as intended.

DONE.
