  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.invert(op.attributes, baseOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` method of `AttributeMap` is called with the `op.attributes` and `baseOp.attributes` as arguments, which would result in a different set of attributes being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.transform(op.attributes, baseOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `transform` method of `AttributeMap` is called with the `op.attributes` and `baseOp.attributes` as arguments, which would result in a different set of attributes being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.merge(op.attributes, baseOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `merge` method of `AttributeMap` is called with the `op.attributes` and `baseOp.attributes` as arguments, which would result in a different
