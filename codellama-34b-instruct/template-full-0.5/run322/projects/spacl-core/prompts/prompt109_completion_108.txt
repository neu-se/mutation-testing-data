  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path + ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because `path` and `ctx` are strings, and concatenating them would result in a different string than what the original code fragment would produce.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path - ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because `path` and `ctx` are strings, and subtracting them would result in a different string than what the original code fragment would produce.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.replace(ctx, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because `path` is a string, and `ctx` is a regular expression, and replacing `ctx` with an empty string would result in a different string than what the original code fragment would produce.

DONE.
