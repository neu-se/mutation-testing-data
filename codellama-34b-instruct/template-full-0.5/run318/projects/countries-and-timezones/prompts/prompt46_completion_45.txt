  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the first element of the `options` array as the second argument to `getCountry`, instead of the `options` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the length of the `options` array as the second argument to `getCountry`, instead of the `options` object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a new array containing all elements of the `options` array except the first one, as the second argument to `getCountry`, instead of the `options` object itself.

DONE.
