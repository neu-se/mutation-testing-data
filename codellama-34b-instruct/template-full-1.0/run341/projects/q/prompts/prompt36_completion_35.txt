  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
not isNodeJS
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNodeJS` is a boolean value, and negating it with `not` would result in the opposite boolean value, which could lead to a different evaluation of the conditional statement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNodeJS === false
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNodeJS` is a boolean value, and comparing it to `false` using `===` would result in a different evaluation of the conditional statement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNodeJS + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNodeJS` is a boolean value, and adding `1` to it would result in a numeric value, which could lead to a different evaluation of the conditional statement.

DONE.
