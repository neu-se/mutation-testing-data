  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeRejector
```
This would result in different behavior because `makeNodeRejector` is a different method than `makeNodeResolver`, and it will create a rejecting node-style callback instead of a resolving one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeCallback
```
This would result in different behavior because `makeNodeCallback` is a different method than `makeNodeResolver`, and it will create a callback that can be used with both `nodeify` and `Q.ninvoke`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeCallback
```
This would result in different behavior because `makeCallback` is a different method than `makeNodeResolver`, and it will create a callback that can be used with `Q.ninvoke` but not with `nodeify`.

DONE.
