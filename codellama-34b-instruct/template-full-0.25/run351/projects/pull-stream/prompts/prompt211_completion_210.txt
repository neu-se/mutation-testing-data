  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `aborted` is a boolean value, while `null` is a null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `aborted` is a boolean value, while `undefined` is a special value that indicates the absence of any defined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `aborted` is a boolean value, while `!aborted` is the negation of the boolean value, which means it will always be the opposite of the original value.

DONE.
