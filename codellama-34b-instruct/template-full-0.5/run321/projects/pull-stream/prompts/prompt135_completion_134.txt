  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` function is called instead of the `cb` function, which could cause the stream to abort early and not process the data as expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function and would cause an error to be thrown when the stream is processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the error would be logged to the console instead of being passed to the `cb` function, which could cause the stream to not handle the error as expected.

DONE.
