  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `end` is truthy, while this code checks if `end` is not strictly equal to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc > data
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code compares `acc` to `data`, while this code checks if `acc` is greater than `data`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc - data
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code compares `acc` to `data`, while this code subtracts `data` from `acc`.

DONE.
