  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first character of the file name and line number instead of the full file name and line number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the file name and line number in uppercase instead of the original case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber.split(":")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of strings split by the colon character instead of the original string.

DONE.
