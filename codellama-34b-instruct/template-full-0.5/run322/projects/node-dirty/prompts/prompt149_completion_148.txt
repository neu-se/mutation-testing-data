  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb of cbs
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for...of` loop would iterate over the `cbs` array in a different order than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb of cbs.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for...of` loop would iterate over the `cbs` array in reverse order than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb of cbs.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for...of` loop would iterate over a shallow copy of the `cbs` array, rather than the original array.

DONE.
