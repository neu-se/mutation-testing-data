  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeTimezone
```
This would result in different behavior because `memoizeTimezone` is a different function than `memoizeCountry`, and it would cause the code to memoize timezones instead of countries.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeCountry(timezone)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to memoize the timezone instead of the country, which would lead to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeCountry(country)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to memoize the country instead of the timezone, which would lead to incorrect results.

DONE.
