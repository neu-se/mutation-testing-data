 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrl !== null && currentUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `!==` operator instead of `==`. This change would cause the condition to fail if `currentUrl` is null or an empty string, even if `currentUrl.url` exists and has a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrl && currentUrl.hasOwnProperty('url')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `currentUrl` has the `url` property instead of directly accessing the `url` property. This change would cause the condition to fail if `currentUrl` is an object that does not have an `url` property, even if `currentUrl.url` exists and has a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrl && typeof currentUrl.url !== 'undefined'
