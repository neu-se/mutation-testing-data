  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deprecated` property is now being accessed from the `options` object instead of the `country` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country.deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deprecated` property is now being accessed from the `country` object instead of the `options` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone.deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deprecated` property is now being accessed from the `timezone` object instead of the `country` object.

DONE.
