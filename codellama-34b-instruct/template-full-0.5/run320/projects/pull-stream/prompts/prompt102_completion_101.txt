  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.warn
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.warn` would log a warning message to the console, while `console.log` would log a normal message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.error
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.error` would log an error message to the console, while `console.log` would log a normal message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.info
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.info` would log an informational message to the console, while `console.log` would log a normal message.

DONE.
