  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with

`otherIter.next(thisIter.next().length)`

This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to advance one step further than the `thisIter`, potentially skipping over a necessary operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with 

`otherIter.prev(thisIter.next().length)`

This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to move backward in the array, which would then cause it to skip over operations that should be processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with 

`const nextOp = thisIter.next()`
`otherIter.next(nextOp.length)`

This would result in different behavior because it would assign the next operation from the `thisIter` to a new variable `nextOp` and then pass the `nextOp` length to the `otherIter`, this would cause the `otherIter` to advance one step further than the `thisIter`, potentially skipping over a necessary operation.
