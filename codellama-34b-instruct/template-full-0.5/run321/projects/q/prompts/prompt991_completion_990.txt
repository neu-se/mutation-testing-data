  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array would be one element shorter than expected, potentially causing the function to fail or produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array would have an extra element, which could cause the function to fail or produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array would be empty, potentially causing the function to fail or produce incorrect results.

DONE.
