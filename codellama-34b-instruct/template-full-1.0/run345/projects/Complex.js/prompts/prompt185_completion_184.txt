  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the real part of the complex number by the reciprocal of the real part of the complex number, which would result in a complex number with a magnitide of 1 and an angle of 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] * a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the product of the real parts of the two complex numbers to the imaginary part of the first complex number, which would result in a complex number with a different magnitude and angle than the original complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * z['im'] + b * a * z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the product of the imaginary parts of the two complex numbers to the product of the real parts of the two complex numbers, which would result in a complex number with a different magnitude and angle than
