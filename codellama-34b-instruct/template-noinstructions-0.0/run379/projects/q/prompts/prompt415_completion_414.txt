  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` is a more general check that returns `true` for any object with a `then` method, while `isPromise` only returns `true` for instances of the `Promise` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isObject
```
This would result in different behavior because `isObject` checks if a value is an object, while `isPromise` checks if a value is a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFunction
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFunction` checks if a value is a function, while `isPromise` checks if a value is a promise.

DONE.
