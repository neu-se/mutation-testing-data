  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a + 1` expression is always positive, while the original expression `a` can be either positive or negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a * 2` expression is always twice the value of `a`, while the original expression `a` can be any value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a / 2` expression is always half the value of `a`, while the original expression `a` can be any value.

DONE.
