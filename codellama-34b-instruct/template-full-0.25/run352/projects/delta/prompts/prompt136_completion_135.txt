  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(firstOther.retain - firstLeft);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to advance by a different amount than the original code, potentially skipping over important operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(firstOther.retain - firstLeft + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to advance by an additional amount, potentially skipping over important operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(firstOther.retain - firstLeft - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to advance by a smaller amount, potentially missing important operations.

DONE.
