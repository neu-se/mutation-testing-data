  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"#"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string concatenation operator in the `filterStackString` function would no longer work as intended, leading to incorrect stack trace filtering.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"%"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function would no longer be able to extract the file name and line number from the stack trace, leading to incorrect stack trace filtering.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"*"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInternalFrame` function would no longer be able to identify internal frames in the stack trace, leading to incorrect stack trace filtering.

DONE.
