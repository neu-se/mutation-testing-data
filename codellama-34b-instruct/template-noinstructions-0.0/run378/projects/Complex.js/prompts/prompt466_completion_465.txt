  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the strict equality operator `===` to check if `b` is equal to 0, while this code uses the abstract equality operator `==` which will return `true` if `b` is equal to 0 or if `b` is `NaN`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the strict inequality operator `!==` to check if `b` is not equal to 0, while this code uses the abstract inequality operator `!=` which will return `true` if `b` is not equal to 0 or if `b` is `NaN`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the strict equality operator `===` to check if `b` is equal to `NaN`, while this code uses the abstract equality operator
