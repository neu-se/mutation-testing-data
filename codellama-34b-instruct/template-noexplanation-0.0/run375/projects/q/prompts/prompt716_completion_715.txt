  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This change will cause the `dispatch` method to be called with the `this` context of the `Promise` object, which is necessary for the method to work correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.call(this)
```
This change will cause the `dispatch` method to be called with the `this` context of the `Promise` object, which is necessary for the method to work correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.apply(this)
```
This change will cause the `dispatch` method to be called with the `this` context of the `Promise` object, which is necessary for the method to work correctly.

DONE.
