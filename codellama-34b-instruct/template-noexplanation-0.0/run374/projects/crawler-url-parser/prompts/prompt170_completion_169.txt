  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.domain != pageurl.domain
```
This code fragment is a buggy version of the original code, as it will always return "subdomain" even if the domains are the same.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.domain === pageurl.domain
```
This code fragment is a buggy version of the original code, as it will always return "subdomain" even if the domains are different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.domain !== pageurl.domain
```
This code fragment is a buggy version of the original code, as it will always return "subdomain" even if the domains are different.

DONE.
