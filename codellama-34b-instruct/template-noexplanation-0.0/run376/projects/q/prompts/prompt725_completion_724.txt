  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect.state
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code, but it accesses the `state` property of the `inspect` object, which may not exist or may have a different value than the original code expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect.value
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code, but it accesses the `value` property of the `inspect` object, which may not exist or may have a different value than the original code expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect.fulfilled
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code, but it accesses the `fulfilled` property of the `inspect` object, which may not exist or may have a different value than the original code expected.

DONE.
