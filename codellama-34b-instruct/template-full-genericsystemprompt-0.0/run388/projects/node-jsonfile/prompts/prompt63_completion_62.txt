  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first character of the content, which could potentially change the meaning of the JSON data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert all the characters in the content to uppercase, which could potentially change the meaning of the JSON data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the characters in the content, which could potentially change the meaning of the JSON data.

DONE.
