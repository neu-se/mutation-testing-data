Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
config.hasOwnProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `extends` property is directly owned by the `config` object, whereas the original code checks if the property exists anywhere in the prototype chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.keys
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys` returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property names, and using it in this context would not correctly check if the `extends` property exists in the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
config.in
```
This would result in different behavior because it is not a valid JavaScript method, and would cause a runtime error, whereas the original code uses a valid method to check if the `extends` property exists in the object.

DONE.
