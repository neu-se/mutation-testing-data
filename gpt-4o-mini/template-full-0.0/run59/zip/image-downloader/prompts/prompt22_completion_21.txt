Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.join
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.join` will concatenate the directory and the destination path without resolving it to an absolute path, potentially leading to incorrect file paths.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.normalize
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.normalize` will clean up the path by resolving `..` and `.` segments, but it does not convert a relative path to an absolute path, which may lead to unexpected file locations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.relative
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.relative` computes the relative path from one directory to another, which is not the intended behavior of resolving a destination path to an absolute path.

DONE.
