  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because `res.resume()` is a method that tells the `res` object to continue reading data from the response, whereas `res.resume` is a property that returns a boolean indicating whether the `res` object has been paused or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.destroy();
```
This would result in different behavior because `res.destroy()` is a method that tells the `res` object to release any resources it may be using, whereas `res.resume` is a property that returns a boolean indicating whether the `res` object
