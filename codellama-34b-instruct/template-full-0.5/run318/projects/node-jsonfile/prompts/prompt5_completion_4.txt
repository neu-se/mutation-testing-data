  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would cause the `JSON.parse()` method to throw an error, which would not happen with the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, {encoding: 'utf-16'}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `encoding` option would cause the `JSON.parse()` method to expect a different encoding than the original code fragment, which could result in an error being thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, {reviver: function(key, value) { return value + 1; }}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` option would cause the `JSON.parse()` method to modify the parsed data, which would not happen with the original code fragment.

DONE.
