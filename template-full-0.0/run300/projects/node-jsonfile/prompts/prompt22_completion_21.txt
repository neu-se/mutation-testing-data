  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^\ufeff/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stripBom` function is not being called, and the `replace` method is being called on the `content` variable instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stripBom` function is not being called, and the `slice` method is being called on the `content` variable instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stripBom` function is not being called, and the `substr` method is being called on the `content` variable instead.

DONE.
