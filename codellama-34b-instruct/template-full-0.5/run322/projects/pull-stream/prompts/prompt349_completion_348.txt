  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test(data + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is replaced with `data + 1`, which would cause the test to fail if the function being tested does not handle the case where the input is not exactly equal to the expected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test(data * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is replaced with `data * 2`, which would cause the test to fail if the function being tested does not handle the case where the input is not exactly equal to the expected value, and also if the function does not handle the case where the input is not a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test(data - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is replaced with `data - 1`, which would cause the test to fail if the function
