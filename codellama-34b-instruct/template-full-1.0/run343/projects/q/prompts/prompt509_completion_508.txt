  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisp.call()` will execute the function `thisp` immediately, whereas in the original code, `thisp` is just a reference to the function and is not executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisp.resolve()` will attempt to resolve the promise `thisp` immediately, whereas in the original code, `thisp` is a reference to the function and is not a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp(arg)
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisp(arg)` will execute the function `thisp` with the argument `arg`, whereas in the original code, `thisp` is just a reference to the function and is not executed.

DONE.
