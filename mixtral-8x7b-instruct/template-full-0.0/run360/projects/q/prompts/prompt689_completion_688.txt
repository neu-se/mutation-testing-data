 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"apPLY"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string comparison for the `dispatch` method would fail, causing the `fcall` method to always resolve or reject immediately depending on whether the passed argument is a promise or a regular value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"applyFn"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would not find a corresponding method to handle the `"applyFn"` operation, causing the `fcall` method to always resolve immediately with the passed arguments array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.someNonExistentMethod
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would not find a corresponding method to handle the `this.someNonExistentMethod` operation, causing the `fcall` method to throw a `TypeError` when trying to access the `someNonExistentMethod` property of the promise object.
