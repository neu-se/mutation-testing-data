  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places || 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would always return the right-hand side operand, which is `10`, instead of the `places` variable, which could be any value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places && 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would always return the left-hand side operand, which is `places`, instead of the `10` constant, which could be any value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places * 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would always return the product of `places` and `10`, instead of the `places` variable, which could be any value.

DONE.
