  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.defineProperty(Complex, "__esModule", { 'value': true });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Object.defineProperty` method is used to define a property on an object, but the `Complex` object is not defined in the code snippet provided. Therefore, this line of code would result in a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex['__esModule'] = true;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `__esModule` property is not defined on the `Complex` object in the code snippet provided. Therefore, this line of code would result in a reference error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex['default'] = Complex;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Complex` object is not defined as the default export of the module in the code snippet provided. Therefore, this line of code would not have the same effect as the original code fragment.
