  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `parsedUrl` object instead of the `parsedBaseUrl` object, which could lead to different results when resolving the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `baseUrl` object instead of the `parsedBaseUrl` object, which could lead to different results when resolving the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `URL.parse()` method to parse the `baseUrlStr` string instead of using the `parsedBaseUrl` object, which could lead to different results when resolving the URL.

DONE.
