 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new URL(linkurl)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new URL object with the linkurl string, which might not behave the same way as the original code fragment in certain edge cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
linkurl.toString()
