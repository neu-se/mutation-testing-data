  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a function that resolves a promise, while `reject` is a function that rejects a promise with a reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw exception
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw exception` will cause the promise to be rejected with the specified exception, while `reject(exception)` will cause the promise to be rejected with the exception as the rejection reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because `return reject(exception)` will cause the promise to be rejected with the exception as the rejection reason, while `reject(exception)` alone will cause the promise to be rejected but will not return the rejection reason.

DONE.
