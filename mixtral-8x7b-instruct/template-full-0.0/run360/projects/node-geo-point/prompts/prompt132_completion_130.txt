 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[this, zoom]
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of passing two arguments to the `toTile` function, it would pass an array containing the `GeoPoint` instance and the `zoom` value, which is not the expected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because the `GeoPoint` class does not have a `zoom` property, and trying to access it would result in `undefined`. The original `toTile` function expects the `zoom` as a separate argument, not a property of the `GeoPoint` instance.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(2, Math.random() * 10)
```
This would result in different behavior because it generates a random number between 2 and 1023 (inclusive) instead of using the provided `zoom` value. This change would lead to unexpected tile coordinates,
