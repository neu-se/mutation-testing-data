  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit(new Error('Corrupted row at the end of the db: ' + buffer));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits an error with a message that includes the corrupted row, while the modified code emits an error with a message that only includes the error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('Corrupted row at the end of the db: ' + buffer.toUpperCase()));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits an error with a message that includes the corrupted row, while the modified code emits an error with a message that includes the corrupted row in uppercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('Corrupted row at the end of the db: ' + buffer.split('').reverse().join('')));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits an error with
