  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event emitted would be `'error'` instead of `'drain'`, which would cause the `close()` method to be called immediately instead of waiting for the queue to be drained.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event emitted would be `'close'` instead of `'drain'`, which would cause the `close()` method to be called immediately instead of waiting for the queue to be drained.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'write_close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event emitted would be `'write_close'` instead of `'drain'`, which would cause the `close()` method to be called immediately instead of waiting for the queue to be drained.

DONE.
