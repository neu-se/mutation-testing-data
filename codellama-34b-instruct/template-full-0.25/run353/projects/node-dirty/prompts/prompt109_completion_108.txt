  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('Corrupted row at the end of the db: ' + buffer));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment emits an error event with a custom error message, while this code fragment emits an error event with a different error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('Corrupted row at the end of the db: ' + buffer.length));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment emits an error event with a custom error message, while this code fragment emits an error event with a different error message that includes the length of the buffer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('Corrupted row at the end of the db: ' + buffer.slice(0, 10)));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment emits an error event with a custom error message,
