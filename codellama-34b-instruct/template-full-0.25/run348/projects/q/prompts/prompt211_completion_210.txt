  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback, arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `arguments` object as the `this` context for the `callback` function, which may not be what the original code intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the `this` context for the `callback` function, which may not be what the original code intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `undefined` as the `this` context for the `callback` function, which may not be what the original code intended.

DONE.
