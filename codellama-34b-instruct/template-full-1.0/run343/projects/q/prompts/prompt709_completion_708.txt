  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return `null`, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return the string "hello", regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return the number 42, regardless of the input.

DONE.
