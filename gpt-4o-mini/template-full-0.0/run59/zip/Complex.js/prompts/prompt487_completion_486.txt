Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the exported object from the `Complex` class to the `Math` object, which does not have the same properties or methods, leading to incorrect usage of the complex number functionalities.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex['Complex']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a circular reference where `Complex` is assigned to itself, potentially causing issues when trying to access the `Complex` class, leading to unexpected results or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex['NaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the `Complex` class to a property named `NaN`, which is misleading and would not allow the `Complex` class to be instantiated or used correctly, as it would overwrite the intended `NAN` constant.

DONE.
