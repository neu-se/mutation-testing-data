  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to advance by `length` positions, which could lead to incorrect results in the `transform` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to advance by `length + 1` positions, which could lead to incorrect results in the `transform` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to advance by `length - 1` positions, which could lead to incorrect results in the `transform` method.

DONE.
