  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the latitude of the destination point instead of the latitude of the starting point, which could lead to a different bearing calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the longitude of the destination point instead of the longitude of the starting point, which could lead to a different bearing calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1 + φ2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the latitudes of the starting and destination points, which could lead to a different bearing calculation.

DONE.
