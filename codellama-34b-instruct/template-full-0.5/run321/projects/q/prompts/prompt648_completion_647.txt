  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args.slice()]
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.slice()` creates a shallow copy of the `args` array, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args.concat()]
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.concat()` creates a new array by concatenating `args` with an empty array, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args.filter(function(arg) { return arg !== undefined; })]
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.filter()` creates a new array containing only the elements of `args` that pass the filter function, which may not be the desired behavior.

DONE.
