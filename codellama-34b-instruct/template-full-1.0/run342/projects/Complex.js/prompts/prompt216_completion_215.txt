  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Math.exp(a)` to calculate the natural logarithm of `a`, but `Math.log(a)` calculates the natural logarithm of `a` using natural logarithmic function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Math.exp(a)` to calculate the natural logarithm of `a`, but `Math.sin(a)` calculates the sine of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the natural logarithm of `a`, but `a - 1` would simply subtract `1` from `a`.

DONE.
