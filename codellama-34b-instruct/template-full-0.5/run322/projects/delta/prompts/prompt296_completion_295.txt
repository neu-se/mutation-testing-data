  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be adding 1 to the index, which would cause the loop to skip over the first element of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be subtracting 1 from the index, which would cause the loop to start at the second element of the array instead of the first.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be multiplying the index by 2, which would cause the loop to skip over every other element of the array.

DONE.
