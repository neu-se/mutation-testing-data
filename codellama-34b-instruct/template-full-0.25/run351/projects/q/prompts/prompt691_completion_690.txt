  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [this, array_slice(arguments)]
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` would refer to the global object instead of the `Promise` object, which could cause the `dispatch` method to be called on the wrong object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would omit the first argument to the `apply` method, which could cause the `dispatch` method to be called with the wrong arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would omit the first two arguments to the `apply` method, which could cause the `dispatch` method to be called with the wrong arguments.

DONE.
