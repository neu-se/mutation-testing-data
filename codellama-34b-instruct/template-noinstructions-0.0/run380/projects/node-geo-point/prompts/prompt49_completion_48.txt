  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateBearing` method would use the longitude value instead of the latitude value, which would lead to an incorrect calculation of the bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateBearing` method would use the latitude value of `point1` instead of `point2`, which would lead to an incorrect calculation of the bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateBearing` method would use the longitude value of `point1` instead of `point2`, which would lead to an incorrect calculation of the bearing.

DONE.
