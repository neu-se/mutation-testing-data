 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument (`ref[0]`) would be used instead of the second argument (`ref[1]`). This change could cause issues if the function behaves differently depending on the order of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the last element of the `ref` array would be removed and returned, instead of accessing the second element (`ref[1]`). This change could cause issues if the function relies on the original array content and order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because the first element of the `ref` array would be removed and returned, changing the index of all other elements. This change could cause issues if the function relies on the original array content and order.

DONE.
