  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument would be passed to the `array_slice` function instead of the first argument, which would cause the resulting array to be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument would be passed to the `array_slice` function instead of the second argument, which would cause the resulting array to be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the last argument would be passed to the `array_slice` function instead of the second argument, which would cause the resulting array to be different.

DONE.
