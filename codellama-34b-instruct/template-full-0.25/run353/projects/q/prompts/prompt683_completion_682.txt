  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.fcall` function expects a promise or an immediate reference for the target function, but `null` is not a valid object and would cause the function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.fcall` function expects a promise or an immediate reference for the target function, but `undefined` is not a valid object and would cause the function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.fcall` function expects a promise or an immediate reference for the target function, but `{}` is an empty object and would not have the necessary properties or methods to be used as a function.

DONE.
