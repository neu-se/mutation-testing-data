  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl === "string"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if pageurl is equal to the string "string", which is not the same as checking if pageurl is of type string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.constructor == String
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if pageurl is an instance of the String constructor, which is not the same as checking if pageurl is of type string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof pageurl === "string"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if pageurl is of type string, which is the same as the original code.

DONE.
