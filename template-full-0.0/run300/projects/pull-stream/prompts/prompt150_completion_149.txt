  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `abort` variable, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if `abort` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && value
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator checks if both `abort` and `value` are truthy, and if so, returns `value`. If `abort` is `true` and `value` is `null`, the `if` statement would evaluate to `false`, even if `abort` is `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || value
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator checks if either `abort` or `value` is truthy, and if so, returns `true`. If `abort` is `true` and `value` is `null`, the `
