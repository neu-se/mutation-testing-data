  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.delete(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code deletes the entire delta, while this replacement only deletes the first operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.retain(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code deletes the entire delta, while this replacement only retains the first operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push(new Delta().delete(1))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code deletes the entire delta, while this replacement creates a new delta that deletes the first operation and pushes it onto the original delta.

DONE.
