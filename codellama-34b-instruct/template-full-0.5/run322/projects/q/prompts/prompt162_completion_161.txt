  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackString.split(" ")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the stack string into an array of words, rather than an array of lines.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackString.split("\n")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the stack string into an array of lines, but with the wrong delimiter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackString.split(/\n/)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the stack string into an array of lines, but with the wrong regular expression.

DONE.
