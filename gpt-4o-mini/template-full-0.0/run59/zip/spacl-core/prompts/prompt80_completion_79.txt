Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.query
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule.query` is likely intended to check for allowed actions rather than matching paths, which would lead to incorrect results when determining if a path is governed by the policy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!rule.matches
```
This would result in different behavior because negating the result of `rule.matches` would invert the logic, causing the method to return `false` when it should return `true`, and vice versa.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.matches(path)
```
This would result in different behavior because it omits the `ctx` parameter, which may be necessary for the correct evaluation of whether the path is governed by the policy, potentially leading to incorrect matches.

DONE.
