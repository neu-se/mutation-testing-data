  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.hasNext
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasNext` is a boolean function that returns whether there is a next element in the iterator, whereas `peekType` is a string function that returns the type of the next operation. If the code fragment is replaced with `hasNext`, the function will behave differently because it will consider the presence of a next element rather than the type of the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next
```
This would result in different behavior because `next` is a function that advances the iterator to the next element, whereas `peekType` is a function that returns the type of the next operation without advancing the iterator. If the code fragment is replaced with `next`, the function will behave differently because it will advance the iterator to the next element rather than just returning the type of the next operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType
```
This would result in
