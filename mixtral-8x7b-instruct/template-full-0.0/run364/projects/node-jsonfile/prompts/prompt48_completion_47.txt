 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'x'
```
This would result in different behavior because the return value of `writeFileSync` would be a string 'x' instead of the result of the `fs.writeFileSync` call.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the return value of `writeFileSync` would be a number 1 instead of the result of the `fs.writeFileSync` call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.writeFileSync(file, str, options).toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the return value of `writeFileSync` would be a string representation of the result of the `fs.writeFileSync` call instead of the result itself.

DONE.
