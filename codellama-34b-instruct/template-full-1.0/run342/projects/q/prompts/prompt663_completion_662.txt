  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [name, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the method being called on the object. In the original code, the "post" method is called, but in this new code, the "apply" method is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call", [name, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the method being called on the object. In the original code, the "post" method is called, but in this new code, the "call" method is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 0)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the way the arguments are sliced. In the original code, the arguments are sliced starting from index 1, but in this new code, the arguments are sliced starting from index 0.

DONE.
