  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.done` expects a promise as its first argument, and passing `null` would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.done` expects a promise as its first argument, and passing `undefined` would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.done` expects a promise as its first argument, and passing `42` would cause an error to be thrown.

DONE.
