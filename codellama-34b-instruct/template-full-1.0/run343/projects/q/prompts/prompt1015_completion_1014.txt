  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver` is a function that creates a node resolver object, while `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` calls the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function and will cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function and will cause a runtime error.

DONE.
