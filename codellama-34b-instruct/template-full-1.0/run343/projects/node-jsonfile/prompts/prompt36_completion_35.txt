  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"options"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options` was an object, but the replacement code fragment `"options"` is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options` was an object, but the replacement code fragment `null` is a null value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options` was an object, but the replacement code fragment `undefined` is an undefined value.

DONE.
