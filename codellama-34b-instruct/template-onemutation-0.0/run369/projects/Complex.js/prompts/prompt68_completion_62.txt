  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(a);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not pass any arguments to `parser_exit`, while the modified code fragment passes the `a` argument. This could potentially cause the `parser_exit` function to behave differently, depending on how it is implemented.

DONE.
