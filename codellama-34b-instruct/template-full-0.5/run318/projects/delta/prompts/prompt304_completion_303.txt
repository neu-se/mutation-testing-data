  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

```
This would result in different behavior because the line `const index = typeof thisOp.insert === 'string' ? thisOp.insert.indexOf(newline, start) - start : -1;` would always set `index` to `-1`, causing the `else` branch to be taken and the line to be inserted into the `line` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the line `const index = typeof thisOp.insert === 'string' ? thisOp.insert.indexOf(newline, start) - start : -1;` would always set `index` to `2`, causing the `if` branch to be taken and the line to be inserted into the `line` variable.
