  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_reduce
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_reduce` and `array_map` are different functions, and the replacement code would no longer be semantically correct.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_filter` and `array_map` are different functions, and the replacement code would no longer be semantically correct.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_sort
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_sort` and `array_map` are different functions, and the replacement code would no longer be semantically correct.

DONE.
