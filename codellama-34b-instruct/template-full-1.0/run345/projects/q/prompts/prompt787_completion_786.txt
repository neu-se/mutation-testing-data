  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q` is a value that can be returned by the `then` method in Promises/A+, but `null` is not a valid value and would cause an error if returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q` is a value that can be returned by the `then` method in Promises/A+, but `undefined` is not a valid value and would cause an error if returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('Intentional error')
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q` is a value that can be returned by the `then` method in Promises/A+, but throwing an error would cause the promise to be rejected.

DONE.
