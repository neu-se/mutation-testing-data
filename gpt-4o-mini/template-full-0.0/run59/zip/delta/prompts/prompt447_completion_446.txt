Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to access the next operation in the array instead of the current one, potentially leading to incorrect calculations of lengths and offsets.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index] || { insert: '' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it defaults to an object with an empty insert property if the current operation is undefined, which could lead to unexpected results when trying to access properties of the operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index] && this.ops[this.index].insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it evaluates to the insert property of the current operation if it exists, or `false` if it does not, which would disrupt the length calculation and potentially cause errors in the `next` method.

DONE.
