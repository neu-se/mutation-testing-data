  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first argument of the `post` function, potentially causing the function to have an unexpected behavior or error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 3)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first two arguments of the `post` function, also potentially causing unexpected behavior or error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 4)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first three arguments of the `post` function, again potentially causing unexpected behavior or error.

DONE.
