  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be accessing an index that is out of bounds of the `ref` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be accessing a different index of the `ref` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be accessing the first element of the `ref` array instead of the second element.

DONE.
