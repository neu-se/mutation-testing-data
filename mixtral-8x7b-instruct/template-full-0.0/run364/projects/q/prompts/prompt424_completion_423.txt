 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFulfilled` function would consider promises with a state of "pending" as fulfilled, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFulfilled` function would consider `null` as a fulfilled value, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return true; }
