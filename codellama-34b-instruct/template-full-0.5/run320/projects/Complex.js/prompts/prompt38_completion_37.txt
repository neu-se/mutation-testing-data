  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a <= 3000 && _b <= 3000
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used less than or equal to (<) operator, while this replacement uses less than or equal to (<=) operator. This would cause the function to behave differently for the edge case where _a or _b is exactly equal to 3000.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a < 3000 || _b < 3000
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used logical and (&&) operator, while this replacement uses logical or (||) operator. This would cause the function to behave differently for the edge case where _a and _b are both greater than 3000.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a > 3000 && _b > 3000
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used
