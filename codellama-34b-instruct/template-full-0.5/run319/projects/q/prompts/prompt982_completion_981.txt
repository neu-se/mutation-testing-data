  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(false));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the `nodeArgs` array to be modified in a different way.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(true));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the `nodeArgs` array to be modified in a different way.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(null));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the `nodeArgs` array to be modified in a different way.

DONE.
