  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.max` returns the largest of the two values, whereas `Math.min` returns the smallest.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the length of the other iterator's peeked operation from the length of the current operation, whereas `Math.min` simply returns the smallest of the two values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the length of the current operation from the length of the other iterator's peeked operation, whereas `Math.min` simply returns the smallest of the two values.

DONE.
