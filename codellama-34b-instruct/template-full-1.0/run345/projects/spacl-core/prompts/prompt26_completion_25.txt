  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
min <= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the regex to match empty strings, which is not allowed according to the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
min != 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the regex not match strings that have a length of zero, which is allowed according to the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the regex to match an unlimited number of characters, which is not allowed according to the original code.

DONE.
