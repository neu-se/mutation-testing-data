  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, args.concat(array_slice(arguments, 1))]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only passes the `args` array as the second argument to `dispatch`, while this modified code fragment also passes any additional arguments passed to `post` after the `name` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, args.slice(1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the entire `args` array as the second argument to `dispatch`, while this modified code fragment only passes a slice of the `args` array starting from the second element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, args.reverse()]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `args` array as the second argument to `dispatch` in the order it was received, while this modified code fragment passes the `args` array in reverse
