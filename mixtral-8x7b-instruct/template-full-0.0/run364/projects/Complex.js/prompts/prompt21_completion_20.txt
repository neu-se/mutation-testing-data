 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 * Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces an unnecessary multiplication operation, which would not affect the result in this context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.SQRT2
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.SQRT2` is a constant approximately equal to 1.414, while the original code uses the `Math.sqrt` function to calculate the square root of the sum of squares.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.hypot
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.hypot` calculates the square root of the sum of squares of its arguments, but it does not suffer from the same overflow issues as the original code. In this case, the original code includes a custom `hypot` function to avoid overflows, so using the built-in `Math.hypot` function
