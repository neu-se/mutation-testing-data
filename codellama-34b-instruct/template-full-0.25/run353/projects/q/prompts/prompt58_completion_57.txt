  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof setImmediate !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `setImmediate` is a function, while this replacement checks if it is not a function. This would cause the code to take the `else` branch, which uses `setTimeout` instead of `setImmediate`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof setImmediate === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `setImmediate` is a function, while this replacement checks if it is undefined. This would cause the code to take the `else` branch, which uses `setTimeout` instead of `setImmediate`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof setImmediate === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `setImmediate` is a function, while this replacement checks if it is an object. This would cause the code to take the `else
