 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
{ latitude: 0, longitude: 0 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDestination` method now uses a hardcoded point instead of the instance property `this`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
new GeoPoint(0, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDestination` method now uses a newly created GeoPoint instance with 0 latitude and longitude instead of the instance property `this`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
{ latitude: 1, longitude: 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDestination` method now uses a hardcoded point with latitude and longitude equal to 1 instead of the instance property `this`.

DONE.
