  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString.call(obj)` would return the string representation of the object, while `obj.toString()` would return the string representation of the object's value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString.call(obj)` would return the string representation of the object, while `obj.valueOf()` would return the primitive value of the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.constructor.name
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString.call(obj)` would return the string representation of the object, while `obj.constructor.name` would return the name of the object's constructor function.

DONE.
