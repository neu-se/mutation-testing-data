 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.test
```
This would result in different behavior because `test` is a method that returns a boolean indicating if the provided string matches the regex pattern, while `exec` returns the first match or null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `toString()` converts the regex object to a string representation, rather than executing it against data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 1, regardless of the regex or data, whereas `key.exec` returns a match or null.

DONE.
