  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `abort` variable to determine if an abort signal has been received, while the new code fragment uses the negation of `abort` to determine if an abort signal has not been received.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `abort` variable to determine if an abort signal has been received, while the new code fragment uses `abort || null` to determine if an abort signal has been received or if the `onAbort` function is present.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `onAbort` function to handle an abort signal, while the new code fragment uses the negation of `onAbort` to determine if an abort signal has not been received.

DONE.
