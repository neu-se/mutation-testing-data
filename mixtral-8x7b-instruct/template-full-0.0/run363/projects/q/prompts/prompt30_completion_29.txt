 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => laterQueue.length && laterQueue.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses an arrow function and the `shift` method instead of `pop`, which might affect the order of processing elements in `laterQueue`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
laterQueue.splice(-1, 1)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `splice` method to remove the last element, which is less efficient than `pop` and might have different side effects if the array is being monitored or manipulated elsewhere.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
laterQueue.slice(-1)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `slice` method to get the last element, which does not modify the original array, and might cause unexpected behavior if the code relies on the side effects of using `pop`.

DONE.
