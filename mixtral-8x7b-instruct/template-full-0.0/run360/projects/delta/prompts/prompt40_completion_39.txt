 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.keys(<unknown as {}>)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force TypeScript to widen the `undefined` type to `unknown`, causing a type error when trying to call `Object.keys()` with an `unknown` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.values(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the values of the `b` object instead of its keys, which would change the structure of the resulting object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.keys(b).filter(key => b[key] !== undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it filters out keys with `undefined` values from the `b` object, which could lead to missing properties in the resulting object.

DONE.
