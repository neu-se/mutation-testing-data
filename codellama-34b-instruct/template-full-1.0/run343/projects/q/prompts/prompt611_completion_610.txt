  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"mget"
```
This would result in different behavior because "mget" is not a recognized property of the `Promise` object, and the code would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set"
```
This would result in different behavior because "set" is a recognized property of the `Promise` object, but it's not used in the same way as "get". The code would attempt to set the value of a property called "get" instead of retrieving the value of a property called "get".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post"
```
This would result in different behavior because "post" is a recognized property of the `Promise` object, but it's not used in the same way as "get". The code would attempt to send a message to a value in a future turn instead of retrieving the value of a property.

DONE.
