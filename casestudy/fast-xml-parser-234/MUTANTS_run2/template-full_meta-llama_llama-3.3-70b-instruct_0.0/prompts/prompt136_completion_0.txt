Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
val.substring
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring` does not replace the matched string, but instead returns a subset of the original string, which would not achieve the desired effect of removing trailing zeros.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
val.split
```
This would result in different behavior because `split` splits a string into an array of substrings, rather than replacing a substring, which would not achieve the desired effect of removing trailing zeros.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
val.match
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` returns an array containing the matched strings, rather than replacing a substring, which would not achieve the desired effect of removing trailing zeros.

DONE.
