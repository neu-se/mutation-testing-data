  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.forEach(op => {
  if (op.retain && op.attributes) {
    op.attributes = null;
  }
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the attributes from all retain ops, which would cause the `length` method to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.forEach(op => {
  if (op.retain && op.attributes) {
    op.attributes = { foo: 'bar' };
  }
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the attributes of all retain ops to a hardcoded object, which would cause the `length` method to return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.forEach(op => {
  if (op.retain && op.attributes) {
    op.attributes = op.attributes.slice();
  }
});
