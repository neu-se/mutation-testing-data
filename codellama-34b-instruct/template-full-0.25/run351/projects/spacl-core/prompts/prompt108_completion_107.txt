  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `ctx`, which could change the result of the `query` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the value of `ctx` by 2, which could change the result of the `query` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the `ctx` object, which could be different from the original value of `ctx`.

DONE.
