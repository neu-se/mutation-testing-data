  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength` returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, while adding 1 to it would result in returning the length of the next operation plus one, which could be a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength - 10
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength` returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, while subtracting 10 from it would result in returning the length of the next operation minus 10, which could be a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[0].retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the retain property of the first operation in the delta, which could be different from the retain property of the next operation in the iterator.

DONE.
