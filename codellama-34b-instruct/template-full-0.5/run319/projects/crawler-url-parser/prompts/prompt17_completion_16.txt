  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is a space character, which would be included in the URL string, whereas the original replacement string is an empty string, which would remove the fragment from the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, '?'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is a question mark character, which would be included in the URL string and would change the query string of the URL, whereas the original replacement string is an empty string, which would remove the fragment from the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, 'http://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is the protocol and domain of a URL, which would be included in the URL string, whereas the original replacement string is an empty string, which would remove the fragment from the URL.

DONE.
