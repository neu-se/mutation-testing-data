  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.split("/").filter(function (elem, index, array) {
	return elem.length > 0
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `split` method to split the `linkurl_path` string into an array of substrings, and then filters out any empty strings from the array. In contrast, the proposed replacement code fragment uses the `filter` method to filter out any empty strings from the `linkurl_path` string directly, without first splitting it into an array. This could potentially result in different behavior if the `linkurl_path` string contains any empty strings.

	return elem.length > 0
