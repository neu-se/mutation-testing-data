  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only advances the iterator by one step, while this modified code advances it by two steps.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code advances the iterator by one step, while this modified code moves the iterator backward by one step.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `thisIter` to advance the iterator, while this modified code uses `otherIter`.

DONE.
