Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === 'j' || c === 'J'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the character 'j' or 'J' instead of 'i' or 'I', which means that any complex number represented with the imaginary unit 'i' would not be parsed correctly, leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '1' || c === '2'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the characters '1' or '2' instead of 'i' or 'I', which would cause the parser to incorrectly treat numeric characters as imaginary unit indicators, leading to erroneous parsing of complex numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c !== 'i' && c !== 'I'
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the original condition, meaning that any character that is not 'i' or 'I' would be treated as valid for the imaginary part, potentially leading to incorrect parsing of complex numbers.

DONE.
