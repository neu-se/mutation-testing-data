 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the length of the current operation in the first delta instead of the next operation in the second delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it always sets the length to 0, ignoring the actual length of the next operation in the second delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the length to Infinity, causing the loop to iterate indefinitely or until an error occurs due to exceeding the maximum call stack size.

DONE.
