  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would no longer match the first character of the path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would match the second character of the path, instead of the first.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would match the forward slash character, instead of the first character of the path.

DONE.
