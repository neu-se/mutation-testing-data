 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the next operation in the current delta instead of the next operation in the other delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use a length of 0, potentially causing the loop to terminate prematurely or causing the wrong operations to be compared.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it would potentially cause the loop to never terminate, as the minimum length would always be greater than or equal to Infinity.

DONE.
