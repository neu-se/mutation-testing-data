  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void deferred.reject(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the deferred.reject function is called with a different argument, which could cause the promise to be rejected with a different error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.promise.fail(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the fail function is called on a different object, which could cause the promise to be rejected with a different error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.promise.catch(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the catch function is called on a different object, which could cause the promise to be rejected with a different error message.

DONE.
