  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[args, name]
```
This would result in different behavior because reversing the order of the arguments would cause the method to be called with the name as the first argument and the arguments as the second argument, which would likely cause a different error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[nodeArgs, '']
```
This would result in different behavior because adding an empty string to the arguments array would cause the method to be called with an incorrect number of arguments, which would likely cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, '']
```
This would result in different behavior because adding an empty string to the name would cause the method to be called with an incorrect name, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
