  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` function would not remove the fragment from the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` function would not remove the fragment from the URL, and the `delete parsedUrl.hash` statement would throw an error because `parsedUrl` is null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` function would not remove the fragment from the URL, and the `delete parsedUrl.hash` statement would throw an error because `parsedUrl` is undefined.

DONE.
