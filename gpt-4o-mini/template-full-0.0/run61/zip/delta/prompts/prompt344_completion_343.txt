Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'wrongEmbedType'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the expected embed type, causing the handler to be undefined and potentially leading to a runtime error or incorrect processing of the operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(otherData)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the embed type from `otherData` instead of `thisData`, which could lead to incorrect transformations if the two embed types do not match, resulting in unexpected behavior in the transformation logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it effectively removes the embed type check, causing the handler to be retrieved with a null value, which would lead to a failure in the transformation process, as no valid handler would be found.

DONE.
