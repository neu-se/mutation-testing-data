  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.transformPosition(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0, regardless of the input index, because the function is called with a fixed argument of 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.transformPosition(index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a value that is one more than the input index, because the function is called with an argument that is one more than the input index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.transformPosition(index - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a value that is one less than the input index, because the function is called with an argument that is one less than the input index.

DONE.
