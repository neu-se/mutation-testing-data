  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <GeoPoint>(point.coordinates.reverse());
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, which would result in incorrect coordinates being used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <GeoPoint>(point.coordinates.slice(0, 1));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method returns a new array with the specified range of elements, which would result in only the first coordinate being used.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <GeoPoint>(point.coordinates.map(x => x * 2));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map()` method returns a new array with the result of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array, which would result in the coordinates being multiplied by 2.

DONE.
