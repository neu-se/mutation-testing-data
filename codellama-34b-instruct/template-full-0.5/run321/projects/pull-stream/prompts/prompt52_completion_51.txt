  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operation would change the value of `read`, which could affect the behavior of the `pull` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operation would change the value of `read`, which could affect the behavior of the `pull` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operation would change the value of `read`, which could affect the behavior of the `pull` function.

DONE.
