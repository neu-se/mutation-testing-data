 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.keys(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare keys from `a` instead of `attr`, potentially missing mismatched values for shared keys between `attr` and `base`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.keys(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare keys from `b` instead of `attr`, potentially missing mismatched values for shared keys between `attr` and `base`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.keys(<any>{})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return an empty object, ignoring the comparison between `attr` and `base`.

DONE.
