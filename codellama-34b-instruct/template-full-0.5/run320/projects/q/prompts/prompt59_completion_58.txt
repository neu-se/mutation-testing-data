  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because `window` is an object in a browser environment, so the original code fragment would evaluate to `true` if the code is running in a browser, while the replaced code fragment would evaluate to `false` in a browser environment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because `window` is always defined in a browser environment, so the original code fragment would evaluate to `false` if the code is running in a browser, while the replaced code fragment would evaluate to `true` in a browser environment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "string"
```
This would result in different behavior because `window` is never a string in a browser environment, so the original code fragment would evaluate to `true` if the code is running in a browser, while the replaced code fragment would evaluate to `false` in a browser environment.
