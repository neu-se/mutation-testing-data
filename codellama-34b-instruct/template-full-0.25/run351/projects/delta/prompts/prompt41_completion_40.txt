  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys(b)` returns an array of keys in the `b` object, while `attributes` returns an object with the same keys and values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values(b)` returns an array of values in the `b` object, while `attributes` returns an object with the same keys and values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries(b)` returns an array of key-value pairs in the `b` object, while `attributes` returns an object with the same keys and values.

DONE.
