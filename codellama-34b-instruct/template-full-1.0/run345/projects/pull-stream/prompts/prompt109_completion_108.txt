  Sure! Here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc + data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reducer` function is not being used to combine the accumulated value and the current data value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc - data
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction operator `-` is being used instead of the addition operator `+`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data
```
This would result in different behavior because the accumulated value is not being used at all, and the current data value is being returned instead.

DONE.
