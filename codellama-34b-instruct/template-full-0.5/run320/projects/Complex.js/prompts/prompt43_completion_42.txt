  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === undefined || a === null || a === NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because this code fragment checks for the presence of `NaN` in the input, which is not checked by the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === undefined || a === null || a === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because this code fragment checks for the presence of `Infinity` in the input, which is not checked by the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === undefined || a === null || a === -Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because this code fragment checks for the presence of `-Infinity` in the input, which is not checked by the original code fragment.

DONE.
