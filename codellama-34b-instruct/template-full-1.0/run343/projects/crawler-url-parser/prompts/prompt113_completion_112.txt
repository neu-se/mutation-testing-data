  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because the keys method returns an array of the keys in the map, not the values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.values().reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the reverse method reverses the order of the values in the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.values().includes(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the includes method checks if a specified value is contained within the map.

DONE.
