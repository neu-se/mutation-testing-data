Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `null` instead of `undefined` could lead to unexpected results in promise chains, as `null` is a falsy value but not the same as `undefined`, potentially affecting how subsequent `.then()` handlers are executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(new Error("Progress error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because returning a rejected promise instead of `undefined` would cause the promise chain to be rejected immediately, altering the flow of execution and potentially skipping any subsequent `.then()` handlers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because returning a number (2) instead of `undefined` would change the resolved value of the promise, which could lead to unexpected results in any subsequent promise handlers that expect the original behavior of returning `undefined`.

DONE.
