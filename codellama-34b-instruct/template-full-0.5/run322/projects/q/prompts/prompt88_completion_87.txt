  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is an array-like object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function, while `1` is just a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"1"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is an array-like object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function, while `"1"` is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is an array-like object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function, while `true` is a boolean value.

DONE.
