  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const [key, val] of this._data.entries())
```
This would result in different behavior because `entries()` returns an iterator that includes both the key and value of each entry in the map, whereas the original code fragment only iterates over the keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const key of Object.keys(this._data))
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys()` returns an array of the keys in the map, whereas the original code fragment iterates over the key-value pairs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const val of this._data.values())
```
This would result in different behavior because `values()` returns an iterator that includes only the values of each entry in the map, whereas the original code fragment iterates over the key-value pairs.

DONE.
