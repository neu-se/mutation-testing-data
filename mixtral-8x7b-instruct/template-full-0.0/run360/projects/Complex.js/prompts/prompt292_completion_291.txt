 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument to the `Math.cos()` function would always be 1, instead of the intended value of `2*a`. This is because the multiplication by 2 in the line `var a = 2 * this['re'];` would no longer have any effect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re'] * this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument to the `Math.cos()` function would always be the square of the real part of the complex number, instead of the intended value of `2*a`. This is because the multiplication by 2 in the line `var a = 2 * this['re'];` would no longer have any effect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cos(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument to the `Math.cos()` function
