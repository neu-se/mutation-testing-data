  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 1)` would return a new array containing all elements of `arguments` except the first one, whereas `arguments` is an array-like object that contains all the arguments passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[].slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `[].slice.call(arguments, 1)` would return a new array containing all elements of `arguments` except the first one, whereas `arguments` is an array-like object that contains all the arguments passed to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments.slice(1)` would return a new array containing all elements of `arguments` except the first one, whereas `arguments` is an array-like object that contains all the arguments passed
