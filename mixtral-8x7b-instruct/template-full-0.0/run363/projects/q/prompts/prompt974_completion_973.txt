 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the current promise object, which is not what we want in this case. The original code fragment, `object`, refers to the first argument passed to the `npost` method, which is the object that has the named method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of an object would cause an error in the `npost` method. The `npost` method expects an object as the first argument, and passing `null` would violate this expectation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q` is the constructor function for the Q promise library. Passing `Q` instead of an object would cause an error in the `npost` method, as it expects an object with a named method as the first argument.

DONE.
