  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the function call for checking the length of the next operation in the iterator with a call to see if there are any more operations, which would change the behavior of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the function call for checking the length of the next operation in the iterator with a call to see if there are any remaining operations, which would change the behavior of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the function call for checking the length of the next operation in the iterator with a call to get the next operation, which would change the behavior of the program.

DONE.
