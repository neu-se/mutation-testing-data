  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.includes(pageurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `linkurl_path` and `pageurl_path` variables are swapped, which would cause the `gettype` function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!pageurl_path.includes(linkurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is added before the `pageurl_path.includes(linkurl_path)` expression, which would cause the `gettype` function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.startsWith(pageurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `startsWith` method is used instead of the `includes` method, which would cause the `gettype` function to return a different value.

DONE.
