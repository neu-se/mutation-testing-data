  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
PLACEHOLDER(null, value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeback` function is called with the wrong number of arguments, effectively throwing away the `value` return value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
PLACEHOLDER(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeback` function is called with a single argument instead of the correct two arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback(null, value * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `value` return value is modified by doubling it before calling the `nodeback` function.

DONE.
