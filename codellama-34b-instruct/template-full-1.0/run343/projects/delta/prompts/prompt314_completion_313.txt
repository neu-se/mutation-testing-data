  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.deleteNotSeemThisOp
```
This would result in different behavior because `deleteNotSeemThisOp` is not a valid method of the `inverted` object, and would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.deleteThisOp
```
This would result in different behavior because `deleteThisOp` is not a valid method of the `inverted` object, and would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.deleteOtherOp
```
This would result in different behavior because `deleteOtherOp` is not a valid method of the `inverted` object, and would throw an error.

DONE.
