  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops
```
This would result in different behavior because `ops` is an array, and `ops.ops` would be `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `ops.length` is a number, and `ops.ops` would be `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `ops[0]` is the first element of the `ops` array, and `ops.ops` would be `undefined`.

DONE.
