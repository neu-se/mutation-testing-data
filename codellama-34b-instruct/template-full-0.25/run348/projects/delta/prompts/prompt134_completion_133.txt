  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextOp` is an object with properties `insert`, `retain`, and `delete`, and `nextOp.insert` would return the value of the `insert` property, which is a string. In the original code, `nextOp` is used as an object, and `nextOp.insert` would return the value of the `insert` property, which is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextOp.retain` would return the value of the `retain` property, which is a number. In the original code, `nextOp.retain` is used as a boolean value, and `nextOp.retain` would return the value of the `retain` property, which is a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior
