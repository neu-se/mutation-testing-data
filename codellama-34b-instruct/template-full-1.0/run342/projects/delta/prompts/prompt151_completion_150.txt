  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain - firstLeft + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain one more character than the original code, which could cause a mismatch between the expected and actual results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain - firstLeft - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain one less character than the original code, which could cause a mismatch between the expected and actual results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain - firstLeft * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain twice as many characters than the original code, which could cause a mismatch between the expected and actual results.

DONE.
