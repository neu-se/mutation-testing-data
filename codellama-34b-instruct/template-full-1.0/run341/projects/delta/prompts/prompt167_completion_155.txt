  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push('Invalid Op');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert a string 'Invalid Op' into the delta, which is not a valid operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherIter.next());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the next operation from the other iterator into the delta, rather than the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the new operation into the delta, rather than the current operation.

DONE.
