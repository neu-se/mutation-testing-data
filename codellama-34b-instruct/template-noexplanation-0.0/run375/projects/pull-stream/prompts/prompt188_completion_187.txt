  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i--]
```
This code fragment will cause the function to return the previous element in the array instead of the current one, which may cause the function to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i+1]
```
This code fragment will cause the function to return the next element in the array instead of the current one, which may cause the function to return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i*2]
```
This code fragment will cause the function to return the element at twice the current index in the array, which may cause the function to return incorrect results.

DONE.
