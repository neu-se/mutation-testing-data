 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the special cases for `b` being 1 or -1 would not be checked when `a` is greater than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / a === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `a` is exactly equal to 0, instead of just checking if `a` is 0. This would cause the special cases for `b` being 1 or -1 to never be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(a) < Number.EPSILON
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `a` is close to 0, instead of just checking if `a` is 0. This would cause the special cases for `b` being 1 or -1 to never be executed.

DONE.
