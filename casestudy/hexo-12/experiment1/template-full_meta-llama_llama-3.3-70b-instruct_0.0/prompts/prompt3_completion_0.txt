Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data.title.toString() || data.slug
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of operations is changed, potentially leading to different results if either `data.title` or `data.slug` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(data.slug + data.title).toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it concatenates `data.slug` and `data.title` instead of using the OR operator, potentially leading to unexpected results if both properties are truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data.path.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a different property (`data.path`) instead of `data.slug` or `data.title`, potentially leading to incorrect slug generation if `data.path` is not suitable for slugization.

DONE.
