  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `verb.toUpperCase()` would return the uppercase version of the `verb` string, while `verb` would return the original string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `verb.length` would return the length of the `verb` string, while `verb` would return the original string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb.charAt(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `verb.charAt(0)` would return the first character of the `verb` string, while `verb` would return the original string.

DONE.
