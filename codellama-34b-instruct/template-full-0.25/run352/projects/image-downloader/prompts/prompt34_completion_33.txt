  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.resume(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `res.resume(<PLACEHOLDER>)`, which would resume the response stream with the value of the `PLACEHOLDER` variable. Replacing it with `null` would cause the stream to resume with a `null` value, which could potentially cause errors in the code that relies on the response data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.resume(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `res.resume(<PLACEHOLDER>)`, which would resume the response stream with the value of the `PLACEHOLDER` variable. Replacing it with `undefined` would cause the stream to resume with an `undefined` value, which could potentially cause errors in the code that relies on the response data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
