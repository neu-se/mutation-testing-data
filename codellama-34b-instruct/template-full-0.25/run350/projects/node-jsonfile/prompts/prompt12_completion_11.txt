  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options ? options.reviver : options.replacer
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `replacer` option instead of the `reviver` option, which could cause the JSON parsing to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options ? options.reviver : null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the `reviver` option, even if it is not provided in the `options` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options ? options.reviver : undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the `reviver` option, even if it is not provided in the `options` object, and would also set the `undefined` value as the `reviver` function.

DONE.
