  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
TypeError
```
This would result in different behavior because `TypeError` is a different type of error than `SyntaxError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ReferenceError
```
This would result in different behavior because `ReferenceError` is a different type of error than `SyntaxError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
EvalError
```
This would result in different behavior because `EvalError` is a different type of error than `SyntaxError`.

DONE.
