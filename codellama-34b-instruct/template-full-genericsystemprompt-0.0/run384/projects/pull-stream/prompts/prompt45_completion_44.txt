  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read && typeof read.source !== 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `read.source` is a function, while this new code fragment checks if it is not a function. This would cause the code to behave differently in cases where `read.source` is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read && typeof read.source === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `read.source` is a function, while this new code fragment checks if it is an object. This would cause the code to behave differently in cases where `read.source` is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read && typeof read.source === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `read.source` is a function, while this new code fragment checks if it is undefined. This would cause the code to behave differently in
