  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a, b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `atan2` function, which takes two arguments and returns the arctangent of the quotient of the two arguments. In contrast, the code fragment `a, b` would simply return the tuple `(a, b)`, which is not the same as the arctangent of the quotient of `a` and `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b, a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `atan2` function, which takes two arguments and returns the arctangent of the quotient of the two arguments. In contrast, the code fragment `b, a` would simply return the tuple `(b, a)`, which is not the same as the arctangent of the quotient of `b` and `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because
