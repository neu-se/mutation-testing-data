  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the condition checks whether `b` is not an object or equal to `null`. Replacing it with `null` would cause the condition to always evaluate to `false`, which could potentially break the functionality of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof b !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original condition checks whether `b` is not an object or equal to `null`. Replacing it with `typeof b !== 'string'` would cause the condition to treat `b` as a string, which could change the behavior of the code in some cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original condition checks whether `b` is not an object or equal to `null`. Replacing it with `b` would cause the condition to always evaluate to `true`, which could potentially break the functionality of the code.
