  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args + []
```
This would result in different behavior because `args + []` is a concatenation of `args` with an empty array, whereas `arguments` is an array-like object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `args[0]` would result in just the first argument, whereas `args` would result in all arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.reverse()` would result in the arguments in reverse order, whereas `args` would result in the arguments in their original order.

DONE.
