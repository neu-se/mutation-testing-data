  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver.bind(deferred)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` set to `deferred`, whereas the original code uses `deferred` as the `this` value directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver.call(deferred)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` immediately calls the function with `deferred` as the `this` value, whereas the original code creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` set to `deferred`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver.apply(deferred)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` immediately calls the function with `deferred` as the `this` value, whereas the original code creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` set to `deferred
