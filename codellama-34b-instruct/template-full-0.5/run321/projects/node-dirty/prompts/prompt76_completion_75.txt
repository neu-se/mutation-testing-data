  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `0` is a falsy value, while the replacement code fragment `1` is a truthy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `0` is a falsy value, while the replacement code fragment `null` is a falsy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `0` is a falsy value, while the replacement code fragment `undefined` is a falsy value.

DONE.
