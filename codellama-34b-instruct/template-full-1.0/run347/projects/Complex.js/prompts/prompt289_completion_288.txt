  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `cosh` instead of `sinh`. This would result in a wrong result because the correct value of `cos(a) * sinh(b)` is obtained from the `sinh` function, which is different from `cosh(a) * sinh(b)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `Math.sinh` instead of `sinh`. This would result in an infinite loop because `Math.sinh` takes one argument, which is `x`, while the function was expecting two arguments, `re` and `im`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `-sinh` instead of `sinh`. This would result in a wrong result because the correct value of `-sin(a) * sinh(b)` is obtained from `-sinh(a) * sinh(b)`, which is different from `cosh(a) * sinh(b)`.

DONE.
