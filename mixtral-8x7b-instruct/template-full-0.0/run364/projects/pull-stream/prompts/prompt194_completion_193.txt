 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.exit(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately terminate the process, not allowing the rest of the code to execute and potentially causing issues in the overall application flow.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always call the callback with a null error, even if an error occurred in the `read` or `map` functions. This could cause issues in the application as errors might be ignored and not handled properly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log('Skipping this iteration')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would print a message instead of calling the callback, which could cause the application to not continue processing the data as expected. This might lead to unexpected behavior or errors in the application.

DONE.
