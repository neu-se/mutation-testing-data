  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i++], null
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the values returned by the callback is reversed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i++]
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would only return a single value instead of two.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, array[i++]
```
This would result in different behavior because the first value returned by the callback would be `undefined` instead of `null`.

DONE.
