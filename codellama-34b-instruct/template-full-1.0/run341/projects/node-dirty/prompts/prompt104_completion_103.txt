  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `this._data.set` is used to set the value of a key in the cache, while `this._data.delete` would remove the key and its value from the cache.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data2.set
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `this._data` is used to reference the cache, while `this._data2` is not defined in the code snippet.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set()
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `this._data.set` is used to set the value of a key in the cache without a callback function, while `this._data.set()` would attempt to call a function that is not defined.

DONE.
