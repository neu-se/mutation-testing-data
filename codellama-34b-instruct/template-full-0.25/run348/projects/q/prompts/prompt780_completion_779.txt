  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejected` is a function that is not defined in the code snippet, and it would cause a `ReferenceError` when the promise is rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
noop
```
This would result in different behavior because `noop` is a function that does nothing, and it would prevent the promise from being rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("rejected")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error when the promise is rejected, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the error as the reason.

DONE.
