 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
delta.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds elements to the beginning of an array, rather than the end using `push`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
delta.splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` can add, remove, or replace elements in an array, and requires additional arguments to specify the operation and the index at which to perform it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
delta.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes the last element from an array and returns it, rather than adding a new element using `push`.

By introducing these changes, we can expose potential weaknesses in the test suite by causing the tests to fail or behave unexpectedly, indicating that the tests may not be effectively covering all edge cases or possible code paths. DONE.
