  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the entire length of the operation, rather than just the length of the insert operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the entire length of the other operation, rather than just the length of the insert operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the length of the operation, rather than the length of the insert operation.

DONE.
