Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ strict: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isGlob` function would be called with stricter options, potentially changing the classification of certain patterns as globs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isGlob` function would be called with default options, which might be different from the original `{ strict: false }` options, potentially affecting the function's output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` as the options object to the `isGlob` function would likely cause it to throw an error or behave unexpectedly, changing the overall behavior of the `isDynamicPattern` function.

DONE.
