  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, causing the `rejected` function to be called with the `fulfilled` value and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because only the `fulfilled` function would be called with the value, and the `rejected` function would not be called even if the promise is rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as the first argument to the `fulfilled` function, which may cause it to behave differently than if it were passed the `rejected` value.

DONE.
