  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[value, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, which could cause the `set` method to set the wrong property on the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value, 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument is being passed to the `set` method, which could cause it to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the value being set is being incremented by 1, which could cause the `set` method to set the wrong value on the object.

DONE.
