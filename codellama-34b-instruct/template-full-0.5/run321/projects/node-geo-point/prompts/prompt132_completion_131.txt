  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude, zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the latitude instead of the longitude as the first argument to the `toTile` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude, zoom + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the longitude instead of the latitude as the first argument to the `toTile` method, and it would pass a different zoom level.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude + 1, zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different latitude as the first argument to the `toTile` method.

DONE.
