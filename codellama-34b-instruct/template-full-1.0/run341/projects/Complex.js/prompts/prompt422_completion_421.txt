  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.conjugate().negate()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `negate()` method is called on the complex conjugate, not the original complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inverse()` method returns the reciprocal of the complex number, not the negated complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.pow(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pow()` method returns the complex number raised to a power, not the negated complex number.

DONE.
