  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
`line, {}, {}`
This would result in different behavior because the empty object `{}` would be passed as the second argument to the `predicate` function, instead of the correct `attributes` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
`null, null, null`
This would result in different behavior because the `predicate` function would be called with `null` values for the `line`, `attributes`, and `index` parameters, instead of the correct values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
`line, {}, i + 1`
This would result in different behavior because the `index` parameter would be incremented by 1, instead of remaining at the same value.

DONE.
