 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_indexOf` check would always return -1, as `[]` is not the same as `reportedUnhandledRejections`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_indexOf` would return -1 when checking for the index of `promise` in `null`, and the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array would not be modified.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array would be modified directly instead of creating a copy of the `unhandledReasons` array.

DONE.
