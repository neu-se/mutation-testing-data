  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `self` is a reference to the object that the method is being called on, while `null` is a primitive value that does not have any properties or methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `self` is a reference to the object that the method is being called on, while `undefined` is a primitive value that does not have any properties or methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `self` is a reference to the object that the method is being called on, while `this` is a reference to the object that the method is being called on, but it is not a primitive value.

DONE.
