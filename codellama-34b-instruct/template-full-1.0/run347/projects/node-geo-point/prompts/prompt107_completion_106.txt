  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 2+2 instead of 2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply 2*2 instead of 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would divide 2 by 2 instead of 2.

DONE.
