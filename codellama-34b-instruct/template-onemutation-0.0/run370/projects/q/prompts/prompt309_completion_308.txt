  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a function that resolves the promise with a value or another promise, while `reject` is a function that rejects the promise with a reason or another promise. In this context, using `resolve` instead of `reject` would cause the promise to be resolved with the value `undefined`, which may not be the intended behavior.
