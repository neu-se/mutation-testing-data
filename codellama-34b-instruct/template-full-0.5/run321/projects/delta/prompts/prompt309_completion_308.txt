  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.insert(0, '\n')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert a newline character at the beginning of the line, which would cause the line to be considered empty and the `predicate` function to be called with an empty line, potentially causing the `eachLine` function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.insert(0, 'a')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the character 'a' at the beginning of the line, which would cause the line to be considered non-empty and the `predicate` function to be called with a non-empty line, potentially causing the `eachLine` function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.insert(0, ' ');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert a space character at the beginning of the line, which would cause the line to be considered non-empty and the `predicate`
