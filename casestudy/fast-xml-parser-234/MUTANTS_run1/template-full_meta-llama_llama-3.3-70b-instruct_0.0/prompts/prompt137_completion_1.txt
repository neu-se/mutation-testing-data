Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/[a-z]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove any trailing lowercase letters from the string `val` instead of removing trailing zeros after a decimal point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/\./
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first occurrence of a decimal point in the string `val`, potentially changing the interpretation of the number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/[eE]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove any trailing 'e' or 'E' characters from the string `val`, which could affect the parsing of numbers in scientific notation.

DONE.
