  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation of isNaN would return true for any numeric value, whereas the original code would only return true for NaN.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === a
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression a === a would always evaluate to true, whereas the original code would only evaluate to true for NaN.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] < -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression z['im'] < -1 would evaluate to true for any imaginary part less than -1, whereas the original code would only evaluate to true for NaN.

DONE.
