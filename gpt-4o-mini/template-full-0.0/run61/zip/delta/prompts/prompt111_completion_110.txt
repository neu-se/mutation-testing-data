Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
target.unshift(op);
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the `op` to the beginning of the `passed` array instead of the end, which changes the order of the elements in the `passed` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
target.push(op.length);
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes the length of the `op` object into the `passed` array instead of the `op` itself, which alters the contents of the `passed` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
target.push({ ...op });
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of the `op` object and pushes that copy into the `passed` array, which may lead to unexpected results if the original `op` object is modified later.

DONE.
