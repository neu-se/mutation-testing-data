 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property values, rather than an array of keys. This change would cause the `buildTimezonesMap` function to behave differently, as it relies on the keys to associate timezones with countries.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'toString'
```
This would result in different behavior because it is a string that represents a method, not a function to get object keys. This would cause a TypeError when attempting to use the `toString` as a function, breaking the `buildTimezonesMap` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.from(data.timezones).reduce
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new Array instance from an array-like or iterable object, and then applies the `reduce` function. This change would cause issues if `data.timezones`
