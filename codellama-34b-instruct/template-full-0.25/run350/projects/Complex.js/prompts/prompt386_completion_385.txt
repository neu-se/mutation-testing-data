  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cosh` function to always return `0`, regardless of the input value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cosh` function to always return `1`, regardless of the input value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cosh` function to always return `1`, regardless of the input value.

DONE.
