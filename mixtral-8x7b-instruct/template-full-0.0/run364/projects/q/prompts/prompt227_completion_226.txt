 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
messages.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would only execute the message-sending part of the promise if there are already messages in the array, which is not the behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always execute the message-sending part of the promise, regardless of whether the promise has already been resolved or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
messages === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only execute the message-sending part of the promise if the `messages` variable has not been defined, which is not the behavior of the original code.

DONE.
