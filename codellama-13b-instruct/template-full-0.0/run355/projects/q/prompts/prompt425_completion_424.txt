  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.state
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the fulfillment value of the promise, while the new code fragment returns the state of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.value
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the fulfillment value of the promise, while the new code fragment returns the value of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.reason
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the fulfillment value of the promise, while the new code fragment returns the reason for the rejection of the promise.

DONE.
