 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a promise that resolves to an empty array instead of continuing the promise chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a promise that resolves to null instead of continuing the promise chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
result.value, callback, errback
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `result.value` as the first argument to `when()` instead of passing the original arguments, potentially causing unexpected behavior in the error handling or continuation of the promise chain.

DONE.
