Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.cwd()
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.cwd()` returns the current working directory of the Node.js process, which may not be the same as the directory where the script is located, leading to incorrect file paths.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.join('some', 'fixed', 'path')
```
This would result in different behavior because using a fixed path instead of `__dirname` would always resolve to the same directory, regardless of where the script is executed, potentially causing file operations to fail if the expected directory structure is not present.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` to `path.resolve()` would cause it to resolve the path relative to the root of the filesystem, which could lead to unexpected results and errors when trying to access files in the intended directory.

DONE.
