  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write(data, (err) => {
        if (!cbs.length && err != null) this.emit('error', err);
        if (--this._inFlightWrites <= 0 && !this._waitForDrain) this.emit('drain');
        for (const cb of cbs) cb(err);
      });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `write` method is called with a callback function that emits an `'error'` event if `err` is not null, but the original code fragment does not include this check.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write(data, (err) => {
        if (!cbs.length && err != null) this.emit('error', err);
        if (--this._inFlightWrites <= 0 && !this._waitForDrain) this.emit('drain');
        for (const cb of cbs) cb();
