 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
otherIter.next
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consume the next operation from the other iterator instead of just peeking at it. This could lead to unexpected changes in the state of the other iterator and cause the `compose` method to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
otherIter.hasNext
