  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.reject(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment did not include the `error` parameter, which would cause the `reject` method to be called with a different argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.reject("Error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment did not include the `error` parameter, which would cause the `reject` method to be called with a different argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.reject(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment did not include the `error` parameter, which would cause the `reject` method to be called with a different argument.

DONE.
