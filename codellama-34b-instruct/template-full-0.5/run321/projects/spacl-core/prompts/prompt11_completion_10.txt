  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/[^/]:|:\/|:$/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `spec` string contains a colon followed by a slash or a colon at the end of the string, while the new code fragment checks if the `spec` string does not contain a colon followed by a slash or a colon at the end of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/[^/]:|:\/|:$/) !== null && spec.match(/[^/]:|:\/|:$/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `spec` string contains a colon followed by a slash or a colon at the end of the string, while the new code fragment checks if the `spec` string contains a colon followed by a slash or a colon at the end of the string and also checks if the `spec` string does not contain a colon followed by a slash or a colon at the end of the string.
