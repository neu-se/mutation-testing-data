Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `null` instead of the error would cause the callback to indicate a successful operation, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the error state in the calling code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `true` would signal that the stream has ended, which could mislead the consumer of the stream into thinking that there are no more data chunks to process, instead of indicating that an error occurred.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `data` instead of the error would cause the callback to process the last successfully read data instead of handling the error, which could lead to incorrect application logic and data processing.

DONE.
