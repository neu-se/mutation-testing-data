  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `task` function would be called with a different argument, which could potentially cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `task` function would be called with a different argument, which could potentially cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `task` function would be called with a different argument, which could potentially cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
