  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, so the `if` statement would evaluate to `true` and the function would return `cb && cb(end)`, which would be `null` if `cb` is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a special value in JavaScript that represents "Not a Number", and it is treated as a falsy value in boolean contexts. So the `if` statement would evaluate to `true` and the function would return `cb && cb(end)`, which would be `null` if `cb` is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a falsy value, so the `if` statement would evaluate to `true` and the function would return `cb && cb(end)`, which would be `null` if
