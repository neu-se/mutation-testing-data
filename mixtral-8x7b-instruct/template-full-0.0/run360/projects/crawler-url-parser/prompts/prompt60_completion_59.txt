 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrlStr, false, true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slashesDash` option is set to `false`, which may not normalize paths as expected in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrlStr, true, false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parseQueryString` option is set to `false`, which may not parse query strings as expected in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrlStr, 'foo', 'bar'
