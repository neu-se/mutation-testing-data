  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` returns `true` for any finite number, while `isNaN` returns `true` only for `NaN` and `Infinity`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isFinite` returns `true` for any non-finite number (i.e., `NaN`, `Infinity`, and `-Infinity`), while `isNaN` returns `true` only for `NaN`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isInfinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite` returns `true` only for `Infinity`, while `isNaN` returns `true` for any non-finite number.

DONE.
