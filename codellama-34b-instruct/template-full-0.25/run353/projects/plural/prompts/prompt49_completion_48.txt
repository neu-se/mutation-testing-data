  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[^aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and the function body is different. The original code fragment only matches words that end with "o" and are not preceded by a vowel, while the new code fragment matches words that end with "o" and are not preceded by a vowel or "quy". Additionally, the function body in the new code fragment always returns the word with "es" appended to it, while the original code fragment returns the word with "es" appended to it only if the word is not "dwarf" or "roof".
