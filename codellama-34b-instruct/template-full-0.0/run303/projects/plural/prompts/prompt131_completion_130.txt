  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].test(word) === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` method returns a boolean value, and the original code fragment only checks if the value is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].test(word) !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` method returns a boolean value, and the original code fragment only checks if the value is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

DONE.
