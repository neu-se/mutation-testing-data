  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*\/?)[\/]?$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the new regex includes an additional `/?` at the end, which makes the last slash optional. This would cause the regex to match URLs that have an optional trailing slash, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*\/?)[\/]?$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the new regex includes the `g` flag, which makes the regex match all occurrences in the input string, rather than just the first one. This would cause the regex to match multiple URLs in a single input string, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*\/?)[\/]?$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the new regex includes the `i` flag, which makes the regex case-insensitive.
