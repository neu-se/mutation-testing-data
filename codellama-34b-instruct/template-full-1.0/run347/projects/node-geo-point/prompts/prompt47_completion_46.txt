  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dfsretenopf(point1.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dfsretenopf` function is not defined, so the code would produce a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the `longitude` property is not the same as the `latitude` property, so the calculation would produce different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the `coordinate` variable is new in this mutation, so the code would produce different results.

DONE.
