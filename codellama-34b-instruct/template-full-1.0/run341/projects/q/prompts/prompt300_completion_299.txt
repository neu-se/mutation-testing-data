  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
none
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the function return an empty promise instead of a promise that resolves to `this`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(Q.resolve)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the function return a promise that resolves to the parent promise, instead of immediately returning the parent promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return this }.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the function return a promise that resolves to the parent promise, instead of immediately returning the parent promise, and it also would create a new scope for the `this` keyword.

DONE.
