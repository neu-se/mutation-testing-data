  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the truthiness of `end`, which means that the `if` statement would always evaluate to `true` regardless of the value of `end`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is a short-circuit operator, which means that if the first operand is falsy, the second operand will not be evaluated. In this case, if `end` is falsy, the `if` statement would always evaluate to `false` regardless of the value of `end`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is a short-circuit operator, which means that if the first operand is truthy, the second operand will not be evaluated. In this case, if `end` is truthy, the `
