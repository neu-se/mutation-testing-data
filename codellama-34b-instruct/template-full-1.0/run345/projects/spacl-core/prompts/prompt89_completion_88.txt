  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(policy) => [policy.name, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value for the key `policy.name` to `null` instead of the `policy` object, which could cause issues when trying to access the policy object later.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(policy) => [policy.name, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value for the key `policy.name` to `undefined` instead of the `policy` object, which could cause issues when trying to access the policy object later.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(policy) => [policy.name, {}]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value for the key `policy.name` to an empty object `{}` instead of the `policy` object, which could cause issues when trying to access the policy object later.

DONE.
