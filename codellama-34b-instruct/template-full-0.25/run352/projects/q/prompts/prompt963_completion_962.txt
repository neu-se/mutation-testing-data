  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` adds an element to the end of an array, while `unshift` adds an element to the beginning. In this case, `push` would cause the `thisp` argument to be passed as the last argument to the `nbind` function, which would likely cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` removes the first element of an array, while `unshift` adds an element to the beginning. In this case, `shift` would cause the `thisp` argument to be removed from the argument list, which would likely cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes the last element of an array, while `unshift` adds an element to the beginning. In this case, `pop` would cause the `thisp`
