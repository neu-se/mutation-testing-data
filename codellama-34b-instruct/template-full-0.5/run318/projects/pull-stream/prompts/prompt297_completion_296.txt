  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `terminate` calls the `cb` function with `ended` as an argument, while this new code fragment calls it with `data`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `terminate` calls the `cb` function with `ended` as an argument, while this new code fragment calls it with `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(ended, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `terminate` calls the `cb` function with `ended` as an argument, while this new code fragment calls it with `data` as the first argument and `ended` as the second argument.

DONE.
