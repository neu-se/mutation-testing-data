  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^\\//) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression now matches a backslash followed by a forward slash, which is different from the original code that matched a forward slash alone.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\\/.test(spec) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression now matches any character except a newline, while the original code only matched a forward slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.charAt(0) !== '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the first character of the spec string is a forward slash, while the original code used regular expressions to match the entire string.

DONE.
