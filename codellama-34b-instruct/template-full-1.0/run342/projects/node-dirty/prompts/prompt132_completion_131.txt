  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [value, cbs] of this._queue
```
This would result in different behavior because `value` and `cbs` would be reversed from the original code, which could potentially cause issues with the functionality of the `Dirty` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, cbs] = this._queue[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the destructuring syntax would assign `key` to the first element of the `_queue` array and `cbs` to the second element, while the original code assigns `key` to the value and `cbs` to the callback array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [, cbs] of this._queue
```
This would result in different behavior because the destructuring syntax would assign `cbs` to the second element of the `_queue` array, while the original code assigns `key` to the value and `cbs` to the callback array
