  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"use strict";
```
This would result in different behavior because the "use strict" directive would be applied to the entire file, rather than just the function expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"use strict";
var foo = "bar";
```
This would result in different behavior because the "use strict" directive would be applied to the entire file, rather than just the function expression, and the variable `foo` would be declared in the global scope, rather than the function scope.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"use strict";
var foo = "bar";
function baz() {
    console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the "use strict" directive would be applied to the entire file, rather than just the function expression, the variable `foo` would be declared in the global scope, rather than the function scope, and the function `baz` would be declared in the global scope, rather than
