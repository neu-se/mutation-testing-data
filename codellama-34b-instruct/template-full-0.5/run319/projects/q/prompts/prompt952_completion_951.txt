  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp, arguments.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments.slice()` returns a shallow copy of the `arguments` object, whereas `arguments` itself is a special object that is always passed by reference.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp, arguments.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments.concat()` returns a new array that contains the elements of `arguments`, whereas `arguments` itself is a special object that is always passed by reference.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp, arguments.splice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments.splice()` returns a new array that contains the elements of `arguments` after removal of the specified elements, whereas `arguments` itself is a special object that is always passed by reference.

DONE.
