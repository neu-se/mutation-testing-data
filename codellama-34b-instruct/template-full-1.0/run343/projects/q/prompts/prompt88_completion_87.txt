  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
123
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is a special object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function, while `123` is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"abc"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is a special object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function, while `"abc"` is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is a special object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function, while `{}` is an empty object.

DONE.
