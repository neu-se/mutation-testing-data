  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, i++
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`, and it would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i, i++
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a different value, and it would also cause the `i` variable to be incremented twice.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1, i++
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a different value, and it would also cause the `i` variable to be incremented twice.

DONE.
