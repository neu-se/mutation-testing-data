  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This would result in different behavior because `x` is a different variable than `y`, and it may not have the same value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `y + 1` is a different expression than `y`, and it may not have the same value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(y)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin(y)` is a different function than `y`, and it may not have the same value.

DONE.
