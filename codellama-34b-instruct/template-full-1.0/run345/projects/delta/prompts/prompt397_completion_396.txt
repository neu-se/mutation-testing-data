  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat the input as a delete operation, rather than a retain operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(length + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain one more character than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(length, { color: 'red' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would apply a red color attribute to the retained text, rather than the default behavior of no color attribute.

DONE.
