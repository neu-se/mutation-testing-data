  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object would be sliced starting from the third argument, instead of the second.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object would be sliced starting from the first argument, instead of the second.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object would be sliced starting from the zeroth argument, instead of the second.

DONE.
