  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the length of the current operation from the base index, rather than adding it. This could cause the iterator to miss certain operations or insertions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex * length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the base index by the length of the current operation, rather than adding it. This could cause the iterator to skip over certain operations or insertions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex % length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would find the remainder of the base index divided by the length of the current operation, rather than adding it. This could cause the iterator to skip over certain operations or insertions.

DONE.
