 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` is the correct way to access the cosine function in JavaScript, while `cos` is an unqualified reference that may or may not work depending on whether a local variable or property named `cos` has been defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the order of operations, which could potentially lead to numerical instability or other issues.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.acos` is the arccosine function, not the cosine function. This would cause the calculation to produce incorrect results.

DONE.
