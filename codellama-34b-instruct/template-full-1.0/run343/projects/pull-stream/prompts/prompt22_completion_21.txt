  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read + 1
```
This would result in a different behavior because `read` is a function and `read + 1` is a number, which would cause the `switch` statement to evaluate differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read - 1
```
This would result in a different behavior because `read` is a function and `read - 1` is a number, which would cause the `switch` statement to evaluate differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in a different behavior because `read` is a function and `null` is not a function, which would cause an error to be thrown when `pull()` is called.

DONE.
