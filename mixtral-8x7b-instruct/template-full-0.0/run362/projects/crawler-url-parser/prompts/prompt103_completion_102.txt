 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
tmpUrl.text === text
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for equality instead of checking if `text` is not included in `tmpUrl.text`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!Array.isArray(tmpUrl.text) || !tmpUrl.text.includes(text)
