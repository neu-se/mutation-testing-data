  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `when + 1` would always fail, since `when` is not a number, and add `1` to it would result in NaN.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `when.then` would always fail, since `when` is not a promise object, it doesn't have a `then` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `when[0]` would always fail, since `when` is not an array, it doesn't have a 0th element.

DONE
