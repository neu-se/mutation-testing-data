  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstLine.split(":")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the first part of the stack trace, rather than the entire stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstLine.split(":")[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the second part of the stack trace, rather than the entire stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstLine.split(":")[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the third part of the stack trace, rather than the entire stack trace.

DONE.
