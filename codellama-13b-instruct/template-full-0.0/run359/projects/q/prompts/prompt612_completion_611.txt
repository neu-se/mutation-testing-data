  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be attempting to access a property with the name of the key, followed by the value of the key. This would likely result in a runtime error if the key is not a valid property name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, "key"]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be attempting to access a property with the name of the key, followed by the string "key". This would likely result in a runtime error if the key is not a valid property name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, "key", key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be attempting to access a property with the name of the key, followed by the string "key", followed by the value of the key. This would likely result in a runtime error if the key is not a valid property name.

DONE.
