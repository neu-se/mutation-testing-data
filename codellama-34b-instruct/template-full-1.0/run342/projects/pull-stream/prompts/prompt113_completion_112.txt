  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `cb` function is present, while this new code fragment calls the `cb` function with `null` as an argument. If `cb` is not a function, this would result in a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `acc` variable is null or not, while this new code fragment assigns `null` to `acc` regardless of its previous value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, acc)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only passes the `err` argument to `cb` if `acc` is null, while this new code fragment passes both `err` and `acc` to `cb` regardless of their values.

DONE.
