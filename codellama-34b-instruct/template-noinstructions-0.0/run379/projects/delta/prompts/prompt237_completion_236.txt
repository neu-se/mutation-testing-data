  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `opLength` variable is used to determine the length of the operation, and replacing it with 0 would cause the operation to be skipped entirely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `opLength` variable is used to determine the length of the operation, and replacing it with -1 would cause the operation to be applied in reverse.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `opLength` variable is used to determine the length of the operation, and replacing it with null would cause the operation to be applied with a length of 0.

DONE.
