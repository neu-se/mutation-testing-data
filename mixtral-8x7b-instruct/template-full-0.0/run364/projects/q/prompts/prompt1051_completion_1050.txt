 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` object would not be resolved, causing the `get` method to fail when trying to access the `head` property of a null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject("Error while closing queue")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` object would be rejected with an error message, causing the `get` method to fail when trying to access the `head` property of a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{head: Q.resolve(), tail: Q.resolve()}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` object would be resolved with an empty object, causing the `get` method to return an empty value instead of the expected error message when trying to access the `head` property of an empty object.

DONE.
