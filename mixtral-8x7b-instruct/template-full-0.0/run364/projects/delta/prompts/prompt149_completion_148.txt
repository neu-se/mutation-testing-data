 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain >= firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `firstLeft` to be equal to `firstOther.retain`, which would cause the following `otherIter.next()` to be skipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain - firstLeft >= 0
