This would result in different behavior because the `verb` variable is now always set to the string "POST", regardless of the actual verb being used in the request. This would cause the `query` method to always return `true` for POST requests, even if the verb is not explicitly allowed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = "PUT"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `verb` variable is now always set to the string "PUT", regardless of the actual verb being used in the request. This would cause the `query` method to always return
