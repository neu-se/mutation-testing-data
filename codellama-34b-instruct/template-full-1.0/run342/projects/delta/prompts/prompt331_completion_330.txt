  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the value of `baseOp` by 1, which could cause the code to access a different part of the array or object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the value of `baseOp` by 1, which could cause the code to access a different part of the array or object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp * 10
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the value of `baseOp` by 10, which could cause the code to access a different part of the array or object, or to produce a different result altogether.

DONE.
