  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_concat
```
This would result in different behavior because array_concat returns a new array with the elements of the input array, whereas array_slice returns a new array with the selected elements from the input array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_length
```
This would result in different behavior because array_length returns the length of the input array, whereas array_slice returns a new array with the selected elements from the input array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_map(array_slice)
```
This would result in different behavior because array_map returns a new array with the results of applying the function to each element of the input array, whereas array_slice returns a new array with the selected elements from the input array.

DONE.
