 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Error('File not found')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would always be 'File not found', even if the error is caused by something other than a file not being found.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
err || new Error('Unknown error')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return an error object with the message 'Unknown error', even if a specific error message is available.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ code: 'ENOENT', message: 'File not found' }
