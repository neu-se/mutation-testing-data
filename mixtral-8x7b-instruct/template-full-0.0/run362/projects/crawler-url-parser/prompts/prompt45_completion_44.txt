 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'', true, true
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty string will be passed as the second argument to `URL.parse()`, which might affect the parsing of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
baseUrlStr, false, true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slashesDenoteHost` option is set to `false`, which might affect the parsing of the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
baseUrlStr, true, false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parseQueryString` option is set to `false`, which might affect the parsing of the URL query parameters.

DONE.
