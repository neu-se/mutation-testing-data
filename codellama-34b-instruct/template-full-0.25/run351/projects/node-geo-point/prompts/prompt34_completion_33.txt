  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin` and `cos` have different values for the same input, which would cause the `calculateDistance` method to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `tan` and `cos` have different values for the same input, which would cause the `calculateDistance` method to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `acos` and `cos` have different values for the same input, which would cause the `calculateDistance` method to return a different value.

DONE.
