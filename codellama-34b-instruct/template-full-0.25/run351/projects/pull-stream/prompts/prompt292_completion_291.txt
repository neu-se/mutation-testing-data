  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field, false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nonUnique` function would now always return `false`, regardless of whether the item has been seen before or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field, !true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nonUnique` function would now always return `false`, regardless of whether the item has been seen before or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nonUnique` function would now always return `null`, regardless of whether the item has been seen before or not.

DONE.
