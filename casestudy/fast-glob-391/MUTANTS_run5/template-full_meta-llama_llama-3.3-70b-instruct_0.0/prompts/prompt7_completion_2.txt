Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ ...this._micromatchOptions, dot: false }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dot` option is set to `false`, which means that dot files will not be matched by the negative patterns, potentially allowing them to pass through the filter when they should be excluded.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ ...this._micromatchOptions, nocase: !this._micromatchOptions.nocase }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nocase` option is toggled, which means that the case sensitivity of the negative patterns will be opposite to what is intended, potentially allowing or excluding files based on incorrect case matching.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._settings
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this._settings` object is used instead of the `this._micromatchOptions` object, which means that the negative patterns will be matched using the settings object's properties, potentially causing unexpected behavior due to the mismatch between the expected options and the actual settings.

DONE.
