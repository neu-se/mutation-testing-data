  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r > 1 ? 0 : r
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a ternary operator to return 1 if the value of r is greater than 1, but this replacement code fragment always returns 0 if the value of r is greater than 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r > 1 || r < -1 ? 0 : r
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only considers the case where the value of r is greater than 1, but this replacement code fragment also considers the case where the value of r is less than -1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r > 1 ? r : -r
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment always returns the value of r, but this replacement code fragment returns the negative of the value of r if the value of r is greater than 1.

DONE.
