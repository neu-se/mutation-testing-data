  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^\uFEFF/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the BOM character from the beginning of the content, whereas the original code fragment would only remove the BOM character if it was the first character in the content.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^\uFEFF/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove all occurrences of the BOM character from the beginning of the content, whereas the original code fragment would only remove the first occurrence.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^\uFEFF/g, ' ')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace all occurrences of the BOM character with a space character, whereas the original code fragment would only remove the BOM character.

DONE.
