  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the `resolvedPromise` property was set to 1, but after replacing it with 2, the if statement would always evaluate to true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the `resolvedPromise` property was set to 1, but after replacing it with 0, the if statement would always evaluate to false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the `resolvedPromise` property was set to 1, but after replacing it with NaN, the if statement would always evaluate to false.

DONE.
