  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `resolve` is a function that returns a resolved promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("something went wrong")
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` will cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `resolve` and `reject` will cause the promise to be resolved or rejected, respectively.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deferred.reject(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` will cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `resolve` and `reject` will cause the promise to be resolved or rejected, respectively.

DONE.
