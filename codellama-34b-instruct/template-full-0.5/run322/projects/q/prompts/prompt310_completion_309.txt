  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject, resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments to `Q` is reversed, so the `reject` function would be called with the value of `answerPs[i]` as its argument, rather than the `resolve` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve, resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because both `resolve` and `reject` would be called with the value of `answerPs[i]` as its argument, which is not what the original code intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject, reject
```
This would result in different behavior because both `reject` and `resolve` would be called with the value of `answerPs[i]` as its argument, which is not what the original code intended.

DONE.
