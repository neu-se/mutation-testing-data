  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length < 0
```
This change will cause the `retain` method to always return `this`, regardless of the value of `length`. This could potentially cause issues if the method is called with a negative value, as it may not behave as expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length === 0
```
This change will cause the `retain` method to always return `this`, regardless of the value of `length`. This could potentially cause issues if the method is called with a non-zero value, as it may not behave as expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length !== 0
```
This change will cause the `retain` method to always return `this`, regardless of the value of `length`. This could potentially cause issues if the method is called with a zero value, as it may not behave as expected.

DONE.
