Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getNumStr(dstOffset + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the `dstOffset`, which would incorrectly represent the daylight saving time offset, potentially leading to incorrect time calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(utcOffset + 60)
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 60 minutes to the `utcOffset`, which would incorrectly adjust the UTC offset by one hour, leading to inaccurate time representation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getNumStr(-dstOffset)
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the `dstOffset`, which would incorrectly represent the daylight saving time offset as a negative value, potentially causing confusion in time representation.

DONE.
