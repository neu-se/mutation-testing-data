Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === false ? null : end
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly checks for `end` being `false` instead of `true`, which would lead to returning `null` when `end` is `false`, potentially causing the callback to be invoked with incorrect arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end ? acc : end
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns `acc` when `end` is truthy, which means that the accumulator value would be returned instead of `null` when the stream ends, leading to incorrect results in the callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === true ? undefined : end
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns `undefined` instead of `null` when `end` is `true`, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the callback function that expects a specific value.

DONE.
