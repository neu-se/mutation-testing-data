  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
regardless, regardless
```
This would result in different behavior because the `regardless` function would be called twice, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the error message "Q can't get fulfillment value from any promise, all promises were rejected. Last error message: undefined".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
regardless, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `regardless` function would be called once, which would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the value `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, regardless
```
This would result in different behavior because the `regardless` function would be called once, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the error message "Q can't get fulfillment value from any promise, all promises were rejected. Last error message: undefined".

DONE.
