 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.then.get
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is used to chain promises, and `get` is not a method of the result of `then`. This would cause an error and the `get` method would not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get.call(ends.promise)
