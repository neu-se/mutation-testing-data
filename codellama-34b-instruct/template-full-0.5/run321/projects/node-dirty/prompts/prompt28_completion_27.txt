  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different, and the `emit` function would trigger the `'error'` event instead of the `'drain'` event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different, and the `emit` function would trigger the `'close'` event instead of the `'drain'` event.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different, and the `emit` function would trigger the `'load'` event instead of the `'drain'` event.

DONE.
