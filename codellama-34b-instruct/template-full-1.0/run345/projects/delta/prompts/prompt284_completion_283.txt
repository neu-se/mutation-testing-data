  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```\n```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the newline character, which could cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
``` "" ```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert an empty string, which could cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```" "```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert a single space character, which could cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

DONE.
