Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `AttributeMap.invert` function to receive `null` instead of the actual attributes, potentially leading to incorrect attribute handling or errors during the inversion process.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would default to an empty object if `op.attributes` is `undefined`, which may change the outcome of the `AttributeMap.invert` function, potentially leading to unintended attribute retention or loss.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a number (the length of the attributes object) instead of the attributes object itself to the `AttributeMap.invert` function, likely causing type errors or incorrect processing of attributes.

DONE.
