  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size && this._inFlightWrites > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if either the queue size is greater than 0 or the number of in-flight writes is greater than 0, while this new code fragment checks if both conditions are true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size || this._inFlightWrites < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if either the queue size is greater than 0 or the number of in-flight writes is greater than 0, while this new code fragment checks if either the queue size is greater than 0 or the number of in-flight writes is less than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size && this._inFlightWrites < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if either
