  Here are three different options for replacing the "PLACEHOLDER" in the code:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1+1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a reference to the 'this' object, while the new code fragment adds two numbers and returns the result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a reference to the 'this' object, while the new code fragment multiplies the longitude of the current point by 2 and returns the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a reference to the 'this' object, while the new code fragment divides the longitude of the current point by 2 and returns the result.

DONE.
