  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
types.map
```
This would result in different behavior because `types` is not defined, so the code would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` expects a function as its argument, while `map` expects an object or an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.reduce
```
This would result in different behavior because `reduce` expects a function as its argument, while `map` expects an object or an array.

DONE.
