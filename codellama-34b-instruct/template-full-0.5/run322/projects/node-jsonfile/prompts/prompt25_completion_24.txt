  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `content` is a variable that refers to the content of the file being read, while the new code fragment `null` is a constant that always evaluates to the value `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `content` is a variable that refers to the content of the file being read, while the new code fragment `undefined` is a constant that always evaluates to the value `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `content` is a variable that refers to the content of the file being read, while the new code fragment `''` is a string that always evaluates to an empty string.

DONE.
