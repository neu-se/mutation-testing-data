  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `>` operator is used instead of `!==`, which would cause the `untrackRejection` function to be called even if the `unhandledRejections` array does not contain the `promise` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at < -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<` operator is used instead of `!==`, which would cause the `untrackRejection` function to be called even if the `unhandledRejections` array contains the `promise` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at === -2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator is used instead of `!==`, which would cause the `untrackRejection` function to be called even if the `unhandledRejections` array does not contain the `promise` argument.

DONE.
