Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('warning', new Error('Empty lines never appear in a healthy database'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits a 'warning' event instead of an 'error' event, which may not be handled by the same listeners and could lead to unreported issues.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('Database contains empty lines'));
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message is altered, which could affect how the error is logged or displayed, potentially leading to confusion about the nature of the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('info', new Error('Empty lines never appear in a healthy database'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits an 'info' event instead of an 'error' event, which may be ignored by the application logic that is only set up to handle error events, thus failing to alert the user to a critical issue.

DONE.
