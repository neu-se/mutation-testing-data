  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is simply returning the `data` variable, while this new code fragment is returning the `data` variable plus 1. This change would cause the test suite to fail if it is not expecting this new behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is simply returning the `data` variable, while this new code fragment is returning the `data` variable multiplied by 2. This change would cause the test suite to fail if it is not expecting this new behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is simply returning the `data` variable, while this new code fragment is returning the `length` property of the `data` variable. This change would cause the test suite to fail if it is not expecting this new behavior.
