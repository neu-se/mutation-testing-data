  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.insert === 'object' &&
          typeof lastOp.insert === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `insert` property of `newOp` and `lastOp` to be compared as objects, rather than strings. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the objects are not identical.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.insert === 'function' &&
          typeof lastOp.insert === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `insert` property of `newOp` and `lastOp` to be compared as functions, rather than strings. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the functions are not identical.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.insert === 'undefined' &&
          typeof lastOp.insert === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `insert` property of `newOp` and `last
