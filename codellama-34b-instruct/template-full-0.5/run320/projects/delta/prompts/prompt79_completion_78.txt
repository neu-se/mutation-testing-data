  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' && newOp.insert != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the last operation is a deletion, while this replacement checks if it is a retention.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp.insert === 'string' && newOp.insert != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the last operation is a deletion, while this replacement checks if it is an insertion.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp.attributes === 'object' && newOp.insert != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the last operation is a deletion, while this replacement checks if it has attributes.

DONE.
