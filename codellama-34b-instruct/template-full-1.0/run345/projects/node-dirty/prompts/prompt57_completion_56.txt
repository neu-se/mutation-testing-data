  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'data'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close()` method would be called when new data is available to read, instead of when the file stream has drained.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close()` method would be called when an error occurs with the file stream, instead of when the file stream has drained.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'write'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close()` method would be called when data is written to the file stream, instead of when the file stream has drained.

Please note that these are not mutation testing but rather simple semantic observations based on understanding of the code and purpose of the event handler.

DONE.
