  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(deferred).promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise object, rather than acting on the existing `deferred` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(deferred.promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new promise object, but it would not be the same promise object as the one stored in the `deferred` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new promise object, rather than the existing `promise` object.

DONE.
