  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip every other index, potentially missing certain verbs in the `verbs` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would decrement the index instead of incrementing it, potentially causing an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would reset the index to 0 on every iteration, potentially causing an infinite loop.

DONE.
