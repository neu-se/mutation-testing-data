Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
link.getPath()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error with the path of the link instead of the filename, potentially leading to different error messages or handling.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
steps.join(sep)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error with the joined path steps instead of the filename, which could affect error handling or logging.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.root.getPath()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error with the path of the root directory instead of the filename, which could lead to incorrect error messages or handling, especially if the root directory is not the expected location.

DONE.
