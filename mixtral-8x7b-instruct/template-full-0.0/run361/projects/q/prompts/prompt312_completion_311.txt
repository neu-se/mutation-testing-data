 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method of `null` is not a function, causing a TypeError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
answerPs[i] || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an empty object instead of `undefined` when `i` is out of bounds, which might not trigger the expected error handling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
answerPs[Math.floor(Math.random() * answerPs.length)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would randomly select an element from `answerPs` instead of iterating through them sequentially, potentially causing unexpected race conditions or incorrect order of execution.

DONE.
