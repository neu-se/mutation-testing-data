  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(2).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first segment of the path instead of the last.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().join('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would join the segments back together with '/' instead of returning an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().map(segment => segment.toUpperCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would uppercase each segment of the path instead of returning the original segments in reverse order.

DONE.
