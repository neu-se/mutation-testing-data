  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `window` as the `this` value for `setImmediate`, which is necessary for the function to work correctly. Replacing `window` with `null` would cause the function to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `window` as the `this` value for `setImmediate`, which is necessary for the function to work correctly. Replacing `window` with `undefined` would cause the function to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `window` as the `this` value for `setImmediate`, which is necessary for the function to work correctly. Replacing `window` with `this` would cause the function to fail.

DONE.
