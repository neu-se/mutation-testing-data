  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[1], ref[2])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using the `pull` function with three arguments, but the replacement code is only using two arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[1], ref[3])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using the `pull` function with three arguments, but the replacement code is using a different order for the arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[2], ref[3])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using the `pull` function with three arguments, but the replacement code is using a different order for the arguments and also using a different value for the third argument.

DONE.
