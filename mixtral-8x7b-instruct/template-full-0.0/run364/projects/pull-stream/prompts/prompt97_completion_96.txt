 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ended
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.ended` refers to the `ended` property of the current object, while the original code refers to the local variable `ended`. This change could cause the function to behave unexpectedly if the object has a property named `ended` with a different value than the local variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
global.ended
```
This would result in different behavior because `global.ended` refers to the `ended` variable in the global scope, while the original code refers to the local variable `ended`. This change could cause the function to behave unexpectedly if there is a global variable named `ended` with a different value than the local variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.ended
```
This would result in different behavior because `data.ended` refers to the `ended` property of the `data` object, while the original code refers to the local variable `ended`.
