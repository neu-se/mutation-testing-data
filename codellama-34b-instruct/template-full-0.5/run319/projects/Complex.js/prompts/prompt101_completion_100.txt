  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseInt
```
This would result in different behavior because `parseInt` would parse the string as an integer, whereas `parseFloat` would parse it as a floating-point number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number` would convert the string to a number, whereas `parseFloat` would parse the string as a floating-point number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` would round the number down to the nearest integer, whereas `parseFloat` would parse the string as a floating-point number.

DONE.
