  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.slice()` creates a shallow copy of the `args` array, whereas `args` itself is a reference to the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.concat()` creates a new array that is a concatenation of the `args` array and any additional arguments passed to it, whereas `args` itself is a reference to the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.map(function(x) { return x * 2; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.map()` creates a new array where each element is the result of applying the provided function to the corresponding element of the original array, whereas `args` itself is a reference to the original array.

DONE.
