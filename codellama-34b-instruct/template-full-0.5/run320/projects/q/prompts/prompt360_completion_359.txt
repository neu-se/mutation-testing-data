  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!done
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `done`, which would cause the `then` method to be called even if the promise is already resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `done` is a variable that is only defined within the scope of the `then` method, so comparing it to `undefined` would always return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done !== done
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, and `done` is a variable that is only defined within the scope of the `then` method, so comparing it to itself would always return `false`.

DONE.
