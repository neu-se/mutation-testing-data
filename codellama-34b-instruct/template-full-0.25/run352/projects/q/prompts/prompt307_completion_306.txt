  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(answerPs[i]).then(resolve, reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with the value returned by `Q(answerPs[i]).then(resolve, reject)`, which is not the same as the original code that resolved the promise with the value returned by `Q(answerPs[i])`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(answerPs[i]).then(resolve, reject).then(resolve, reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with the value returned by `Q(answerPs[i]).then(resolve, reject).then(resolve, reject)`, which is not the same as the original code that resolved the promise with the value returned by `Q(answerPs[i])`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(answerPs[i]).then(function(value) {
    return resolve(value);
}, function
