  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof value === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` returns a string indicating the type of the operand, and the original code fragment used the `isPromiseAlike` function to check if the value is a promise-like object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value instanceof Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `instanceof` checks if the value is an instance of the `Promise` class, and the original code fragment used the `isPromiseAlike` function to check if the value is a promise-like object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.then && typeof value.then === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the `isPromiseAlike` function to check if the value is a promise-like object, and this code fragment checks if the value has a `then` property that is a function.

DONE.
