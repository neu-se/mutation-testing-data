  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!busy
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `busy`, so the code would behave differently when `busy` is `true` or `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
busy && !aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator checks if both `busy` and `!aborted` are `true`, so the code would behave differently when `busy` is `true` and `aborted` is `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
busy || aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator checks if either `busy` or `aborted` are `true`, so the code would behave differently when `busy` is `true` or `aborted` is `true`.

DONE.
