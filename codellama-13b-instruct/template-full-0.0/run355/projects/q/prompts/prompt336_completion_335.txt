  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.makePromise(descriptor, fallback, inspect);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `Q.makePromise` function with the `descriptor`, `fallback`, and `inspect` arguments, which would create a new promise object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.makePromise(descriptor, fallback);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `Q.makePromise` function with the `descriptor` and `fallback` arguments, which would create a new promise object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.makePromise(descriptor);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `Q.makePromise` function with the `descriptor` argument, which would create a new promise object.

DONE.
