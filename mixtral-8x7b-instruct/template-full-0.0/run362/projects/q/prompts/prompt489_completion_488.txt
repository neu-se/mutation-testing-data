 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resetUnhandledRejections` function would always execute its first statement, setting `trackUnhandledRejections` to `true`, even if it was passed a different argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'trackUnhandledRejections'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resetUnhandledRejections` function would always attempt to set the `trackUnhandledRejections` variable to the string `'trackUnhandledRejections'`, rather than using the argument passed to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { return undefined; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resetUnhandledRejections` function would always return `undefined`, rather than resetting the `unhandledRejections` and `unhandledReasons` arrays if the argument passed to the function is truthy.
