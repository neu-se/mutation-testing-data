 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
<PLACEHOLDER> || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `attributes` argument to be optional in the `predicate` function, potentially causing unexpected behavior if it is not provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
<PLACEHOLDER>, {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would provide a default value for the `attributes` argument in the `predicate` function, potentially causing unexpected behavior if the function was designed to handle undefined or null values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
<PLACEHOLDER> || { attributes: {} }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would provide a default value for the `attributes` argument in the `predicate` function, but also allow the `predicate` function to handle undefined or null values for the `line` and `index` arguments.

DONE.
