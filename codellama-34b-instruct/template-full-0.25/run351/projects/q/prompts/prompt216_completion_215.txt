  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a rejected promise instead of a resolved one, which would cause the `fulfill` function to be called instead of the `reject` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(value, true);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a resolved promise with a value of `true` instead of the original value, which would cause the `fulfill` function to be called with a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(value, false);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a resolved promise with a value of `false` instead of the original value, which would cause the `fulfill` function to be called with a different value.

DONE.
