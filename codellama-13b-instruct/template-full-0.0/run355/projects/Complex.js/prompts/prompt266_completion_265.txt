  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a, b
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the variables is reversed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the variables are added together.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the variables are multiplied together.

DONE.
