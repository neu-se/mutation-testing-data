  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, deferred.makeNodeResolver()]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only passes `nodeArgs` to the `dispatch` method, while this modified code fragment passes `nodeArgs` and `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` to the `dispatch` method. This could potentially cause the `dispatch` method to behave differently, depending on how it is implemented.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, deferred.reject]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only passes `nodeArgs` to the `dispatch` method, while this modified code fragment passes `nodeArgs` and `deferred.reject` to the `dispatch` method. This could potentially cause the `dispatch` method to behave differently, depending on how it is implemented.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, deferred.resolve]
```
This would result in different behavior
