  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
            this.emit('error', new Error('Empty lines never appear in a healthy database'));
            return;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always emit the error, even if the line is not empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
            row.val = undefined;
            this._data.delete(row.key);
            return;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always delete the data, even if the row is not empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
            row.key = undefined;
            this._data.delete(row.key);
            return;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always delete the data, even if the row is not empty.

DONE.
