  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because `messages` is always truthy, so the `else` branch would never be executed, even if the promise was resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because `messages` is always falsy, so the `if` branch would never be executed, even if the promise was not resolved or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `messages` is always `undefined`, so the `if` branch would never be executed, even if the promise was resolved or rejected.

DONE.
