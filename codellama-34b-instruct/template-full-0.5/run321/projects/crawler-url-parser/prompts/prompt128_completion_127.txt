  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof pageurl === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `pageurl` is a string, while this replacement checks if it is undefined. If `pageurl` is undefined, the replacement would return true, while the original code would return false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof pageurl === "number"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `pageurl` is a string, while this replacement checks if it is a number. If `pageurl` is a number, the replacement would return true, while the original code would return false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof pageurl === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `pageurl` is a string, while this replacement checks if it is an object. If `pageurl` is an object, the replacement would return true, while the original code would return false.
