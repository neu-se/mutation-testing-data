  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `setImmediate` is a function that schedules a function to be called after the current event loop phase, while `setTimeout` schedules a function to be called after a specified number of milliseconds.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setInterval.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `setInterval` schedules a function to be called repeatedly, while `setImmediate` and `setTimeout` only schedule a function to be called once.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestAnimationFrame.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestAnimationFrame` schedules a function to be called before the next repaint, while `setImmediate` and `setTimeout` schedule a function to be called after a specified number of milliseconds.

DONE.
