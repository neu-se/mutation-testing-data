  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodeURI
```
This would result in different behavior because `decodeURI` only decodes the URI components, but not the URI itself, while `decodeURIComponent` decodes both.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
encodeURIComponent
```
This would result in different behavior because `encodeURIComponent` encodes the URI components, but not the URI itself, while `decodeURIComponent` decodes both.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodeURIComponent(pathname)
```
This would result in different behavior because `decodeURIComponent` is called on the `pathname` variable, which may not be the same as the `dest` variable.

DONE.
