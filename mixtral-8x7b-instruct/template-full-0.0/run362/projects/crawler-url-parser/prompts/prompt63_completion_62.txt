 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
ret.host.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `ret.host` is null, while the modified code would convert an undefined or null value to an empty string, potentially causing the condition to always evaluate to true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
window.host
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code refers to the `ret` object, while the modified code refers to the global `window` object, which may not have a `host` property, causing an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
global.host
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code refers to the `ret` object, while the modified code refers to the `global` object, which may not have a `host` property, causing an error.

DONE.
