  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).remove();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `remove()` method will delete the current element and its contents, whereas the original code fragment only removes white space characters from the beginning and end of the text.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `text()` method returns the text content of the current element, whereas the original code fragment returns the text content of the current element with white space characters trimmed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attr()` method returns the value of a specific attribute of the current element, whereas the original code fragment does not use any attribute.

DONE.
