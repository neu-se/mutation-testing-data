Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
utils.pattern.convertPatternsToRe(negative, this._micromatchOptions)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dot` property in the `micromatchOptions` object is not being set to `true` for negative patterns, which could lead to incorrect matching of patterns.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
utils.pattern.convertPatternsToRe(positive, this._micromatchOptions)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function is now using the positive patterns instead of the negative patterns, which would cause the filter to incorrectly match entries.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
utils.pattern.convertPatternsToRe([], this._micromatchOptions)
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array is being passed to the `convertPatternsToRe` function, which would cause the filter to not match any entries, regardless of the negative patterns.

DONE.
