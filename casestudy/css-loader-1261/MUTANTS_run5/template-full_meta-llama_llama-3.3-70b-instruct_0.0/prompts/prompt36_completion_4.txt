Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
encodeURI
```
This would result in different behavior because `encodeURI` is the opposite of `decodeURI`, so instead of decoding the URL, it would encode it, potentially leading to incorrect URL handling.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
normalizedUrl.replace(/%/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove all percentage signs from the URL, potentially altering the URL's meaning and leading to incorrect URL handling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
escape
```
This would result in different behavior because `escape` is a deprecated function that uses a different encoding scheme than `decodeURI`, potentially leading to incorrect URL handling and differences in the resulting URL.

DONE.
