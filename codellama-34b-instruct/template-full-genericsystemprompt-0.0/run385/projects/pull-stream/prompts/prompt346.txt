Your task is to apply mutation testing to the following code:
```
module.exports = function prop (key) {
  return key && (
    'string' == typeof key
    ? function (data) { return data[key] }
    : 'object' === typeof key && 'function' === typeof key.exec //regexp
    ? function (data) { var v = <PLACEHOLDER>(data); return v && v[0] }
    : key
  )
}

```

by replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different
behavior than the original code fragment, which was:
```
key.exec
```
Please consider changes such as using different operators, changing constants,
referring to different variables, object properties, functions, or methods.  

Provide three answers as fenced code blocks containing a single line of code,
using the following template:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Please conclude your response with "DONE."
