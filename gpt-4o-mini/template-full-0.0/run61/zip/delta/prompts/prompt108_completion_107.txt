Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(op, index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the index passed to the predicate function, potentially causing it to operate on the wrong element in the `ops` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(op, index) && op.insert !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an additional condition that filters out operations that do not have an `insert` property, which may lead to fewer operations being included in the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(op, index) || op.delete !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the logic to include operations that have a `delete` property, regardless of whether they pass the original predicate, which could lead to unexpected results in the mapping.

DONE.
