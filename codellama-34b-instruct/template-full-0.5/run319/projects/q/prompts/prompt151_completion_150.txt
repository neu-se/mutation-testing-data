  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` and `unshift` have different behavior when adding elements to an array. `push` adds an element to the end of an array, while `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` and `unshift` have different behavior when removing elements from an array. `pop` removes an element from the end of an array, while `unshift` removes an element from the beginning of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` and `unshift` have different behavior when removing elements from an array. `shift` removes an element from the beginning of an array, while `unshift` removes an element from the end of an array.

DONE.
