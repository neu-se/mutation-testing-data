  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key + '1')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value associated with the key `key + '1'`, rather than the value associated with the key `key`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value associated with the key `key + 1`, rather than the value associated with the key `key`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value associated with the key `key`, rather than the value associated with the key `key + '1'` or `key + 1`.

DONE.
