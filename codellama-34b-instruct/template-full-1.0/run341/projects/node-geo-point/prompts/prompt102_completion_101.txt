  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 + 540 + 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of λ2 would be systematically shifted by 540, which is larger than the range of λ2, causing the calculation of the destination point to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 + 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the λ2 value would be shifted by 360, potentially causing improper calculation of the destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 - 540
```
This would result in different behavior because the λ2 value would be offset by -540, potentially causing improper calculation of the destination point.

DONE.
