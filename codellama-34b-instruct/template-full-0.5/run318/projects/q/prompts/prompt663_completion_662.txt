  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method is called with a different index, which would cause the `args` array to be sliced starting from the third element instead of the second element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method is called with a different index and a different number of elements to slice, which would cause the `args` array to be sliced starting from the second element and including only the first two elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 2, 1)]
