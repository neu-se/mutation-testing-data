  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trim()` method is not being called on the text.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().split(" ").join("");
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` and `join()` methods are being used to remove spaces from the text.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().replace(/\s+/g, "");
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace()` method is being used to remove all whitespace from the text.

DONE.
