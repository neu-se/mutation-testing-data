  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because `_fulfilled` is a function that returns the fulfilled value, while `_rejected` is a function that returns a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `_rejected` is a function that returns a rejected promise, while `_fulfilled` is a function that returns the fulfilled value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_progressed(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because `_progressed` is a function that returns the progressed value, while `_rejected` is a function that returns a rejected promise.

DONE.
