  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cloneShallow
```
This would result in different behavior because `cloneShallow` only creates a shallow copy of the object, whereas `cloneDeep` creates a deep copy, which means that nested objects and arrays are also copied.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cloneDeep(obj, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of `cloneDeep` is a boolean value that indicates whether the clone should be a deep clone or not. If the second argument is `true`, the clone will be a deep clone, which means that nested objects and arrays will also be cloned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cloneDeep(obj, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of `cloneDeep` is a boolean value that indicates whether the clone should be a deep clone or not. If the second argument is `false`, the clone will not be a deep clone, which means that nested objects and arrays
