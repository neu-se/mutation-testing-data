  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"tail"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would try to retrieve the value of the `tail` property instead of the `head` property, which would likely cause errors or unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"head.tail"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would try to retrieve the `tail` property of the `head` property, which would likely cause errors or unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"head.△"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would try to retrieve the `△` property of the `head` property, which would likely cause errors or unexpected results.

DONE.
