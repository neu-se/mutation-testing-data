  Sure, here are the three options with different code fragments:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (var i = 0; i < verbs.length; i++) {
  const verb = verbs[i];
  if (!(verb in this.verbs)) {
    this.verbs[verb] = true;
  }
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for...of` loop would not work correctly if the `verbs` array is modified during the loop, which could happen if the `allow` or `deny` methods are called within the loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs.forEach((verb) => {
  if (!(verb in this.verbs)) {
    this.verbs[verb] = true;
  }
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `forEach` method does not allow the array to be modified during the loop, which could happen if the `allow` or `deny` methods are called within the loop
