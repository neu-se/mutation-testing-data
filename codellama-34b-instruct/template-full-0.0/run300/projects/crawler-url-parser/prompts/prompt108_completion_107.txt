  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `urlMap` to contain the same URL multiple times, leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url + "?"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `urlMap` to contain the same URL with a different query string, leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url.replace("http", "https")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `urlMap` to contain the same URL with a different protocol, leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
