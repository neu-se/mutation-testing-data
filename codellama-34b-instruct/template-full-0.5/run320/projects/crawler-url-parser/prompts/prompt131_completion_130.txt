  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '/').replace(/^/, '/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement pattern is different. The original pattern replaces the last occurrence of "/index." followed by any number of letters, while the new pattern replaces the first occurrence of "/index." followed by any number of letters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '/').replace(/[^/]+$/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement pattern is different. The original pattern replaces the last occurrence of "/index." followed by any number of letters, while the new pattern replaces the last occurrence of any number of non-slash characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '/').replace(/index\.[a-z]+
