  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the sign of the expression, potentially leading to a different value for the result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 - b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the order of operations, potentially leading to a different value for the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the expression, potentially leading to a different value for the result.

DONE.
