  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("This is a test error")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the given error, rather than being fulfilled with the original value of `object`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the `null` value, rather than being fulfilled with the original value of `object`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with an empty object, rather than being fulfilled with the original value of `object`.

DONE.
