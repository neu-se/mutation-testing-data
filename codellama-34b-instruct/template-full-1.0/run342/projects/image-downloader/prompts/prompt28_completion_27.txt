  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimRight().startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `trimLeft()` and `trimRight()` have different effects on the string, and `startsWith()` would detect the difference.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.substring(1).startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring()` with an argument of 1 would remove the first character of the string, and `startsWith()` would detect the difference.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.toUpperCase().startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `toUpperCase()` would uppercase the entire string, and `startsWith()` would detect the difference.

DONE.
