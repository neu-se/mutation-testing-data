  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
This would result in different behavior because `!abort` would always evaluate to `true`, even if `abort` is `false`, which would cause the `if` statement to always execute the first branch, even if the `abort` parameter is not truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || true

This would result in different behavior because `abort || true` would always evaluate to `true`, even if `abort` is `false`, which would cause the `if` statement to always execute the first branch, even if the `abort` parameter is not truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && false
```
This would result in different behavior because `abort && false` would always evaluate to `false`, even if `abort` is `true`, which would cause the `if` statement to always execute the second branch, even if the `abort` parameter is not f
