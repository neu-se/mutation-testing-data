  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && !end
```
The addition of the `&& !end` would result in different behavior because it would further restrict the condition of when the `ended` variable is set to `true`. In the original code, `ended` is set to `true` when the stream ends, but in this modified version, it is set to `true` only when the stream ends and the `end` signal is not present. This would cause the `terminate` function to be called sooner or later than in the original code, depending on the signal received from the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || !end
```
The addition of the `|| !end` would result in different behavior because it would allow the `ended` variable to be set to `true` even if the stream does not end. In the original code, `ended` is set to `true` only when the stream ends, but in this modified version, it is set to `true` when the stream ends or if the `end` signal is not present.
