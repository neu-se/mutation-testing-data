  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[index - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `forEach` loop to skip the first element of the `ops` array, which could lead to unexpected results or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[index - 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `forEach` loop to skip the first two elements of the `ops` array, which could lead to unexpected results or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[index + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `forEach` loop to start from the second element of the `ops` array, which could lead to unexpected results or errors.

DONE.
