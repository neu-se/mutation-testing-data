  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `2 * b + 1` is not equal to `2 * b`, and the resulting value would be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `2 * b - 1` is not equal to `2 * b`, and the resulting value would be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `b * b` is not equal to `2 * b`, and the resulting value would be different.

DONE.
