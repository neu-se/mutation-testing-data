  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would return the first element of the array, rather than the element at the specified index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would return the last element of the array, rather than the element at the specified index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(Math.random() * otherIter.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would return a random element from the array, rather than the element at the specified index.

DONE.
