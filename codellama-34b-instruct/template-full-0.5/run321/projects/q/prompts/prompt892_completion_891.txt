  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nfapply(callback, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nfapply` is a function that takes a Node-style callback and an array of arguments, and returns a promise that is resolved with the result of the callback. In the original code, `Q` is being used as a constructor to create a new promise, which is not the same as calling `Q.nfapply`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nfcall(callback, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nfcall` is a function that takes a Node-style callback and a list of arguments, and returns a promise that is resolved with the result of the callback. In the original code, `Q` is being used as a constructor to create a new promise, which is not the same as calling `Q.nfcall`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nbind(callback, args)
