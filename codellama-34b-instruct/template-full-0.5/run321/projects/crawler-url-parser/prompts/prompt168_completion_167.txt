  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `startsWith` checks if the string starts with the given substring, while `includes` checks if the string contains the substring anywhere.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.endsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `endsWith` checks if the string ends with the given substring, while `includes` checks if the string contains the substring anywhere.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring, while `includes` checks if the substring is present in the string.

DONE.
