  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would decrement the `i` variable instead of incrementing it, which could cause the function to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max--
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would decrement the `max` variable instead of incrementing the `i` variable, which could cause the function to produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i *= 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would double the `i` variable instead of incrementing it, which could cause the function to produce incorrect results.

DONE.
