  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected instead of resolved, which would cause the `then` method to fail instead of succeed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected with a new error instead of resolved with the original value, which would cause the `then` method to fail instead of succeed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(value + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with a different value than the original, which would cause the `then` method to succeed with a different value than expected.

DONE.
