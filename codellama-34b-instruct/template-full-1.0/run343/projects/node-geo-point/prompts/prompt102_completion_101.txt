  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(λ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `rad2deg` converts the result of `atan2` from radians to degrees, whereas `rad2deg(λ2)` would convert the longitude λ2 from radians to degrees.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(λ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `rad2deg` converts the result of `atan2` from radians to degrees, whereas `deg2rad(λ2)` would convert the longitude λ2 from degrees to radians.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 * EARTH_RADIUS
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `rad2deg` converts the result of `atan2` from radians to degrees, whereas `λ2 * EARTH_RADIUS` would convert the longitude λ2 from rad
