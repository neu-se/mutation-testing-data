  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual
```
This change will cause the `diff` function to always return `undefined`, as `!isEqual` will always evaluate to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNotEqual
```
This change will cause the `diff` function to always return `undefined`, as `isNotEqual` is not a valid operator in JavaScript.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!==
```
This change will cause the `diff` function to always return `undefined`, as `!==` is not a valid operator in JavaScript.

DONE.
