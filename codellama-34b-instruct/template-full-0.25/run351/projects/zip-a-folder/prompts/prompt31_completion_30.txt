  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.off
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.off` would turn off the event listener for the `close` event, whereas `output.on` would turn it on.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.addEventListener
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.addEventListener` would add an event listener for the `close` event, whereas `output.on` would turn it on.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.removeEventListener
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.removeEventListener` would remove an event listener for the `close` event, whereas `output.on` would turn it on.

DONE.
