  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).delay
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.delay` returns a promise that is resolved with the value of the original promise after the specified delay, whereas `Q.timeout` returns a promise that is rejected with an error after the specified delay.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.then` returns a promise that is resolved with the value of the original promise, whereas `Q.timeout` returns a promise that is rejected with an error after the specified delay.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).fapply
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fapply` returns a promise that is resolved with the value of the original promise, whereas `Q.timeout` returns a promise that is rejected with an error after the specified delay.

DONE.
