Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing `fulfilled` with `null` would cause the promise to not call the fulfillment handler at all, effectively ignoring the successful resolution of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` instead of `fulfilled` would lead to the same outcome as `null`, where the fulfillment handler is not invoked, thus not handling the resolved value of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { throw new Error("Forced rejection"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing `fulfilled` with a function that throws an error would cause the promise to be rejected immediately, regardless of its original state, leading to an unhandled rejection scenario.

DONE.
