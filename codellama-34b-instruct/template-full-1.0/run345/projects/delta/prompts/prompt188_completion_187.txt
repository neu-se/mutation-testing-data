  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `embedType` would always be 1, which may not be the correct type for the object being composed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<Function>
```
This would result in different behavior because the function being passed to `compose()` would receive different arguments than it would in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compose()` method would no longer be called, resulting in a different output.

DONE.
