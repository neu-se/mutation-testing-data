  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country === null
```
This change will cause the `deliverCountry` function to return `null` if the `country` object is `null`, which is different from the original behavior where it would return `null` if the `country` object is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country.id === null
```
This change will cause the `deliverCountry` function to return `null` if the `country` object has an `id` property that is `null`, which is different from the original behavior where it would return `null` if the `country` object is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country.timezones.length === 0
```
This change will cause the `deliverCountry` function to return `null` if the `country` object has an empty `timezones` array, which is different from the original behavior where it would return `null` if the `country` object is fals
