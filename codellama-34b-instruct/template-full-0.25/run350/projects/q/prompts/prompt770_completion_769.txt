  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `this` keyword to refer to the current object, while the new code fragment uses the `null` keyword, which would cause the `allResolved` method to return a promise that is resolved with `null` instead of the expected array of promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `this` keyword to refer to the current object, while the new code fragment uses the `undefined` keyword, which would cause the `allResolved` method to return a promise that is resolved with `undefined` instead of the expected array of promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `this` keyword to refer to the current object, while the new code fragment uses an empty array, which would cause the `allResolved` method to return a promise that
