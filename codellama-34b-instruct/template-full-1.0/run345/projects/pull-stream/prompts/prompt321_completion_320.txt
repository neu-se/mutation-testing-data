  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, data
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid value for the first argument of the callback function, which is supposed to be a truthy value indicating whether the stream has ended. In the original code, the first argument is `null`, which is a falsy value, indicating that the stream has not ended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true, data
```
This would result in different behavior because `true` is a truthy value, indicating that the stream has ended, while in the original code, the first argument is `null`, which is a falsy value, indicating that the stream has not ended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'data', data
```
This would result in different behavior because a string is a different type than the original value `null`, and the callback function may not be designed to handle this differently.

DONE.
