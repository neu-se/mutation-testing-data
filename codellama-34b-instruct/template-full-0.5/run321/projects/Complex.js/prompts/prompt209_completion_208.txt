  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `b` variable, while the new code fragment uses the `a` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `b` variable, which is a non-zero value, while the new code fragment uses the constant `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `b` variable, which is a non-zero value, while the new code fragment uses the expression `b + 1`, which is a different value.

DONE.
