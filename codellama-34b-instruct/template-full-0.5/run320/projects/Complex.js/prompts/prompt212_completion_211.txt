  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log(a*a + b*b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `logHypot` function, which computes the logarithm of the hypotenuse of a right triangle with sides `a` and `b`, while this code fragment uses the `log` function to compute the logarithm of the sum of the squares of `a` and `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a*a + b*b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `logHypot` function, which computes the logarithm of the hypotenuse of a right triangle with sides `a` and `b`, while this code fragment uses the `sqrt` function to compute the square root of the sum of the squares of `a` and `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(b, a)
```
