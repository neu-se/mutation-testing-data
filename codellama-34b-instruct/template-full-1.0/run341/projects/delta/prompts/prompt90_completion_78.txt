  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.retain === 'number' && typeof lastOp.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof newOp.retain === 'number'` would evaluate to `true` and `typeof lastOp.retain === 'string' would evaluate to `false`, causing the logic of the if statement to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.retain === 'number' && lastOp.retain === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof newOp.retain === 'number'` would evaluate to `true` and `lastOp.retain === 0` would evaluate to `false`, causing the logic of the if statement to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.retain === 'number' && lastOp.retain === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof newOp.retain === 'number'` would evaluate to
