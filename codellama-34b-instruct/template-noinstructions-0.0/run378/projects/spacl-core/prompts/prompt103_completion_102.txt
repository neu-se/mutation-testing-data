  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ctx` parameter is missing, which could cause the `query` method to return incorrect results in certain cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb, path
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the `verb` and `path` parameters is reversed, which could cause the `query` method to return incorrect results in certain cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, ctx, null
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra `null` value is added to the end of the parameter list, which could cause the `query` method to return incorrect results in certain cases.

DONE.
