Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'utf8'
```
This would result in different behavior because it hardcodes the encoding to 'utf8', ignoring any encoding specified in the `options` object, which could lead to incorrect file reading if a different encoding is required.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ mode: 0o666 }
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the options to an object with a mode property, which is not a valid option for `fs.writeFile`, potentially causing the write operation to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` as the options argument would lead to the default behavior of `fs.writeFile`, which may not include any specific options like encoding or flags, potentially resulting in unexpected file writing behavior.

DONE.
