  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object, key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key` property would be incremented by 1, which could cause the `hasOwnProperty` method to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object, key - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key` property would be decremented by 1, which could cause the `hasOwnProperty` method to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object, key * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key` property would be multiplied by 2, which could cause the `hasOwnProperty` method to return a different value.

DONE.
