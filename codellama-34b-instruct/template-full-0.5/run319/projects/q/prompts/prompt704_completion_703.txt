  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `Array.prototype.slice` is a method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array. Using `Array.prototype.slice` instead of `array_slice` would result in a different array being passed to the `dispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `Array.prototype.slice` is a method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array.
