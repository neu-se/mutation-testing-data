  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._load = () => {};
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `_load` method is not called, which means that the database file is not loaded and the cache is not populated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._load = () => { throw new Error('Failed to load database file'); };
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_load` method is now throwing an error, which means that the database file is not loaded and the cache is not populated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._load = () => { this._data = new Map(); };
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_load` method is now creating a new empty map, which means that the database file is not loaded and the cache is not populated.

DONE.
