  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.baseurl
```
This would result in different behavior because `currentUrl.baseurl` is a different URL than `currentUrl.url`, and it may not be a valid URL for the current page.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"http://example.com"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"http://example.com"` is a different URL than `currentUrl.url`, and it may not be a valid URL for the current page.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid URL, and it may cause the `parse` function to throw an error.

DONE.
