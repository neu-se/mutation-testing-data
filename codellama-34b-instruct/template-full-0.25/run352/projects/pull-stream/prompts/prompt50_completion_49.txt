  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s instanceof Function
```
This would result in different behavior because `s instanceof Function` is a more strict check than `typeof s === 'function'`, as it checks whether `s` is an instance of the `Function` class, rather than just checking its type. This could cause the code to behave differently in cases where `s` is a function-like object, but not an instance of `Function`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.constructor === Function
```
This would result in different behavior because `s.constructor === Function` checks whether `s` was constructed by the `Function` constructor, rather than just checking its type. This could cause the code to behave differently in cases where `s` is a function-like object, but not constructed by `Function`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.prototype.constructor === Function
```
This would result in different behavior because `s.prototype.constructor === Function` checks whether `s` has a prototype that
