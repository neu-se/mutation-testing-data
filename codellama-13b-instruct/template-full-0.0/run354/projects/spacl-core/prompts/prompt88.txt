Your task is to apply mutation testing to the following code:
```
import { Policy } from './policy'
import { QueryableMap, QueryContext } from './queryable'

/** Queryable collection of policy documents. */
export class PolicyMap extends Map<string, Policy> implements QueryableMap {
  constructor (...policies: Policy[]) {
    super(<PLACEHOLDER>((policy) => [policy.name, policy]))
  }

  /** Add policies to colllection. */
  push (...policies: Policy[]): this {
    for (const policy of policies) {
      this.set(policy.name, policy)
    }
    return this
  }

  /** Check whether an action is allowed on a path.
    * @param name Policy to be queried.
    * @param path Path to be acted on.
    * @param verb Action to be performed.
    * @param ctx Query context for resolving context-dependent paths.
    * @returns Returns `true` if the action is explicitly allowed,
    *          `false` if the action is explicitly denied, or
    *          `null` if the combination of policy, path and
    *          action is not governed by this collection. */
  query (name: string, path: string, verb: string, ctx?: QueryContext): boolean | null {
    const policy = this.get(name)
    return policy !== undefined
      ? policy.query(path, verb, ctx)
      : null
  }

  /** Check whether a path is governed by a policy in this collection.
    * @param name Policy to be queried.
    * @param path Path to be checked.
    * @param ctx Query context for resolving context-dependent paths. */
  matches (name: string, path: string, ctx?: QueryContext): boolean {
    const policy = this.get(name)
    return policy !== undefined
      ? policy.matches(path, ctx)
      : false
  }

  /** Static constructor function; returns a new PolicyMap. */
  static for (...policies: Policy[]): PolicyMap {
    return new PolicyMap(...policies)
  }
}

```

by replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different
behavior than the original code fragment, which was:
```
policies.map
```
Please consider changes such as using different operators, changing constants,
referring to different variables, object properties, functions, or methods.  

Provide three answers as fenced code blocks containing a single line of code,
using the following template:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Please conclude your response with "DONE."
