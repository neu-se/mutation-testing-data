  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `verb` variable is not defined in the code snippet, and using `next` on an undefined variable would cause a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `generator` variable is not defined in the code snippet, and using `next` on an undefined variable would cause a reference error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q` is a library, and using `next` on a library object would not have the same effect as using it on a generator.

DONE.
