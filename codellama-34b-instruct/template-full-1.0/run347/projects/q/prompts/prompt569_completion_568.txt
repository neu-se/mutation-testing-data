  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because having `null` as the error callback would cause the promise to be rejected with `TypeError: undefined is not a function` if an error is thrown in the generator function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because having `undefined` as the error callback would cause the promise to be rejected with `TypeError: undefined is not a function` if an error is thrown in the generator function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.error
```
This would result in different behavior because having `console.error` as the error callback would cause the error to be logged to the console, but the promise would still be fulfilled with the return value of the generator function.

DONE.
