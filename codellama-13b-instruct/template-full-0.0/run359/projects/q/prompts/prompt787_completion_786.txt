  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new deferred object, which would not be the same as the original deferred object that was used in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(promises)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that is resolved with the value of the original promise, rather than the original promise itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all(promises)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that is resolved with an array of the values of the original promises, rather than the original promises themselves.

DONE.
