  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("Timed out."));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new Error object with a different message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("Timeout");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new Error object with a different message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new TimeoutError(res);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new TimeoutError object with a different message.

DONE.
