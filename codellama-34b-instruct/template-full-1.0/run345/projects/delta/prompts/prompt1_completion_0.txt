  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `a` is not an object, while this replacement checks if `a` is undefined. If `a` is undefined, the replacement would evaluate to true, while the original code would evaluate to false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `a` is not an object, while this replacement checks if `a` is not a number. If `a` is a number, the replacement would evaluate to true, while the original code would evaluate to false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `a` is not an object, while this replacement checks if `a` is not an array. If `a` is an array, the replacement would evaluate to false, while the original code would evaluate
