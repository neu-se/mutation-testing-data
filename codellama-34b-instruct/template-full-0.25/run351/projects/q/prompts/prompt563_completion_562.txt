  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the exception object itself, rather than the value property of the exception object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.message
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the message property of the exception object, rather than the value property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the stack trace property of the exception object, rather than the value property.

DONE.
