  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `read` is a function, and adding 1 to a function would result in a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `read` is a function, and subtracting 1 from a function would result in a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `read` is a function, and multiplying a function by 2 would result in a different value.

DONE.
