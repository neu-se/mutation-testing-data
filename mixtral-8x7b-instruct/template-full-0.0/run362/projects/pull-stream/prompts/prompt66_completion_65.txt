 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end ? null : end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `end` is truthy or falsy, and returns `null` if `end` is truthy. The modified code simply checks if `end` is truthy, and will return `end` if it is falsy, which is different from the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `end` is truthy or falsy, and returns `end` if it is truthy. The modified code always returns `true` if `end` is falsy, which is different from the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end ? undefined : end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `end` is truthy or falsy, and returns `null` if `end` is truthy. The modified code returns
