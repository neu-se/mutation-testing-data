  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(b, a) + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.atan2` function returns the arctangent of `b` and `a`, but adding `Math.PI` to the result would shift the angle by 180 degrees, causing the `arg` function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(b, a) - Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.atan2` function returns the arctangent of `b` and `a`, but subtracting `Math.PI` from the result would shift the angle by -180 degrees, causing the `arg` function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(b, a) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.atan2` function returns the arct
