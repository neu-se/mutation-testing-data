  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `href` attribute as a string, while this modification uppercases the attribute. This could cause the link to be incorrectly parsed, leading to different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href') + '_0'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `href` attribute to construct the `currentUrl` object, while this modification adds an extra character to the URL. This could cause the link to be incorrectly parsed, leading to different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
document.createElement('a').href = href
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `href` attribute to construct the `currentUrl` object, while this modification creates a new `a` element and sets its `href` attribute to the original value. This could cause the link to be incorrectly parsed, leading to different results.
