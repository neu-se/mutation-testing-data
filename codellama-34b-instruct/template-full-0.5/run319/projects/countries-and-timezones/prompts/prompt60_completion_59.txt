  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCity
```
This would result in different behavior because `buildCity` is a different function than `buildCountry`, and it may produce different results when called with the same arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument, `true`, would cause the function to return a different value than it would without that argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument, `false`, would cause the function to return a different value than it would without that argument.

DONE.
