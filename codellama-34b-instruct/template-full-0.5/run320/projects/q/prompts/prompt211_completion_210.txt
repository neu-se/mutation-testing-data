  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(this, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the context of the function, potentially causing errors or unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(null, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the context of the function to the global object, potentially causing errors or unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(window, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the context of the function to the window object, potentially causing errors or unexpected results.

DONE.
