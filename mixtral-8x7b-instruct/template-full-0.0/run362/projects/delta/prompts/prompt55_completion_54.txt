 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false`, causing the `push` method to always insert the newOp at the end of the `ops` array, even if it should be inserted at the beginning.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false`, causing the `push` method to always insert the newOp at the end of the `ops` array, even if it should be inserted at the beginning.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
newOp.insert !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only insert the newOp if it has an `insert` property, which is not the case for delete and retain operations. This would cause those operations to be ignored.

DONE.
