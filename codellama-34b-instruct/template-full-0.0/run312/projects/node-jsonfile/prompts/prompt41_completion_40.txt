  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `_writeFileSync` is a synchronous version of `_writeFile`, which means it would not return a promise and would not be compatible with the `universalify.fromPromise` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_writeFileAsync
```
This would result in different behavior because `_writeFileAsync` is an asynchronous version of `_writeFile`, which means it would return a promise and would be compatible with the `universalify.fromPromise` method. However, it would not be the same as the original `_writeFile` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_writeFile
```
This would result in the same behavior as the original code, because it is the same method being called.

DONE.
