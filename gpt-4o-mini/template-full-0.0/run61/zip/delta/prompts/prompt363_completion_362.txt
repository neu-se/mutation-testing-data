Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to terminate when `otherIter` has no more operations, effectively skipping any remaining operations in `thisIter`, which could lead to incorrect transformations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.hasNext() && otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only continue the loop if both iterators have next operations, potentially ignoring operations in `thisIter` if `otherIter` is exhausted, leading to incomplete transformations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.hasNext() || otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the loop to continue even if `otherIter` has no more operations, which could lead to processing remaining operations in `thisIter` without corresponding operations in `otherIter`, resulting in incorrect delta transformations.

DONE.
