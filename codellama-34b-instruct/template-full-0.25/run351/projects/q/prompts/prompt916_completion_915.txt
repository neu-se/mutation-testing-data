  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Some error"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a new error, whereas the original code would have resolved the promise with the value of `deferred.promise`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with `null`, whereas the original code would have resolved the promise with the value of `deferred.promise`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify("Some notification");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be notified with the string "Some notification", whereas the original code would have resolved the promise with the value of `deferred.promise`.

DONE.
