  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a new deferred object and returns it, while this alternative creates a new deferred object and rejects it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a new deferred object and returns it, while this alternative creates a new deferred object and notifies it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a new deferred object and returns it, while this alternative creates a new deferred object and resolves it.

DONE.
