 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it includes the `this` context as the first argument, unlike the original `arguments.slice(1)` which ignores the `this` context and starts slicing from the second argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `slice` method from an empty array, which would return an empty array instead of slicing the `arguments` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
arguments.slice.call(arguments, 2)
