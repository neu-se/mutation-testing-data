  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(function () {
    throw new Error("Simulated error");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with an error, rather than resolved with the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(function () {
    return Q.reject("Simulated error");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with an error, rather than resolved with the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(function () {
    return Q.delay(1000).then(function () {
        throw new Error("Simulated error");
    });
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with an error after a delay of 1 second, rather than immediately.

DONE.
