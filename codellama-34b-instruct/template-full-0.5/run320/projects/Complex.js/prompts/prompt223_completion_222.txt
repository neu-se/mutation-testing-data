  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r - a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abs()` function would return a different value, potentially causing the `sqrt()` function to return an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - r
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abs()` function would return a different value, potentially causing the `sqrt()` function to return an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abs()` function would return a different value, potentially causing the `sqrt()` function to return an incorrect result.

DONE.
