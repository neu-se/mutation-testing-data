  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function would be called with an incorrect `end` value, which could cause the function to return incorrect results or even throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function would be called with an incorrect `end` value, which could cause the function to return incorrect results or even throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function would be called with an incorrect `end` value, which could cause the function to return incorrect results or even throw an error.

DONE.
