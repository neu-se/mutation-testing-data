  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the value of `ended`, causing the `read` function to be called with a different set of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would only call the `cb` function if `ended` is truthy, whereas the original code would call `cb` regardless of the value of `ended`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would call the `cb` function if `ended` is falsy, whereas the original code would only call `cb` if `ended` is truthy.

DONE.
