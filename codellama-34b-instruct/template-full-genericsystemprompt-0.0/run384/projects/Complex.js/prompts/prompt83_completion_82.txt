  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `plus` and `minus` are both equal to 0, which means that the current token is not a sign, while the replaced code fragment checks if `plus` and `minus` are both equal to 1, which means that the current token is a sign.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `plus` and `minus` are both equal to 0, which means that the current token is not a sign, while the replaced code fragment checks if `plus` and `minus` are both equal to -1, which means that the current token is a sign.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `plus` and `minus` are both equal to 0
