  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] === NaN || z['im'] === NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, even if `z` contains `NaN` values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite(z['re']) || isFinite(z['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, even if `z` contains `NaN` values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNaN(z['re'] + z['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` if `z` contains `NaN` values, but `false` if `z` contains only finite values.

DONE.
