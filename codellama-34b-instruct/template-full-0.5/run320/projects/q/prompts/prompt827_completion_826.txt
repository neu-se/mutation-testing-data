  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.onerror` is a function that handles errors, and by setting it to `null`, any errors that occur will not be handled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function() { throw new Error("Q.onerror was called"); };
```
This would result in different behavior because it defines a new function for `Q.onerror` that throws an error whenever it is called, which would cause any errors that occur to be thrown as exceptions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function() { console.log("Q.onerror was called"); };
```
This would result in different behavior because it defines a new function for `Q.onerror` that logs a message to the console whenever it is called, which would cause any errors that occur to be logged but not handled as exceptions.

DONE.
