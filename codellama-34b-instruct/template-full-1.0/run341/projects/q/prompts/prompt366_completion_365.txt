  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would reject the promise with the `exception` object, which would be caught by the `catch` block, resulting in the promise being resolved instead of rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` would notify the fulfillment value instead of rejecting the promise, which would cause the promise to be fulfilled instead of rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new rejected promise instead of one that is already rejected, which would cause the promise to be fulfilled instead of rejected.

DONE.
