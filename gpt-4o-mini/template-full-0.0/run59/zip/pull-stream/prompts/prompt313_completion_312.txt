Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `true` instead of `null` would indicate that the operation was successful, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the end of the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `undefined` instead of `null` could cause the callback to behave unexpectedly, as it may not be treated as a valid termination signal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `data` instead of `null` would pass the actual data to the callback, which could lead to unintended processing of the data after the termination condition is met.

DONE.
