  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `abort` signal, causing the stream to continue even if it has been aborted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator short-circuits the evaluation of the expression, causing the `false` value to be returned if `abort` is truthy, regardless of the value of `_read`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator short-circuits the evaluation of the expression, causing the `true` value to be returned if `abort` is falsy, regardless of the value of `_read`.

DONE.
