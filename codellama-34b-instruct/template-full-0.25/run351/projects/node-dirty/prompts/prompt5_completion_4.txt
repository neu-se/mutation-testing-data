  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Map` object would not be able to store the key-value pair, as `null` is not a valid key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Map` object would not be able to store the key-value pair, as `undefined` is not a valid key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'key' + Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the key would be a random string, which would not match the original key, and the `Map` object would not be able to find the key-value pair.

DONE.
