  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was using the variable `b`, which is a complex number, while `b * b` would evaluate to a different complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was using the variable `b`, which is a complex number, while `b + b` would evaluate to a different complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was using the variable `b`, which is a complex number, while `b - b` would evaluate to a different complex number.

DONE.
