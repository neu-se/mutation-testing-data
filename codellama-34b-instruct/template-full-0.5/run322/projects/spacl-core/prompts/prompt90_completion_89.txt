  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const policy of policies) {
```
This would result in different behavior because `const policy` is a variable declaration, while `for (const policy of policies)` is a loop that iterates over the `policies` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const policy of this.policies) {
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.policies` is a different array than `policies`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const policy of [...policies]) {
```
This would result in different behavior because `[...policies]` is a different array than `policies`.

DONE.
