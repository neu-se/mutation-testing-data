  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `callback` function is not called with the correct `this` context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `callback` function is not called with any arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `callback` function is not called with the correct arguments.

DONE.
