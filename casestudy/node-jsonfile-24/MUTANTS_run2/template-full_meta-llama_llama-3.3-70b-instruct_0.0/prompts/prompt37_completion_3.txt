Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
obj, options ? options.replacer : undefined, this.spaces
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` and `undefined` can have different effects when passed as arguments to functions, and in this case, `JSON.stringify()` might handle them differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
obj, options.replacer, this.spaces
```
This would result in different behavior because it assumes that `options.replacer` is always defined, which might not be the case, potentially leading to errors if `options.replacer` is `undefined` or `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
obj, this.spaces, options ? options.replacer : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of arguments to `JSON.stringify()` has been changed, which could lead to different serialization behavior if the replacer function relies on the order of its arguments.

DONE.
