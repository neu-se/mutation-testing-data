  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/default[0-9]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches any subdomain that ends with a digit, whereas the original fragment matches any subdomain that ends with a lowercase letter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/default\.[a-z]+/
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches any subdomain that contains a "default" prefix followed by a dot and any uppercase letter, whereas the original fragment matches any subdomain that ends with a lowercase letter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/default$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches any subdomain that contains a "default" suffix, whereas the original fragment matches any subdomain that ends with a lowercase letter.

DONE.
