  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports !== "object" && typeof module === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the condition, causing the code to enter the `else` block when the `if` condition is met, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === "object" && typeof module !== "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the condition to check if `exports` is an object, but `module` is not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === "object" && typeof module === "object" && typeof require === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an additional condition that `require` is a function, which may not be the case in all environments.

DONE.
