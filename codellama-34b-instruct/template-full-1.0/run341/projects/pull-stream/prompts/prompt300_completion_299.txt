  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ap
```
This would result in different behavior because `ap` is a different variable than `ended`, and it is not clear what its value is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because `true` is a different value than `ended`, and it would cause the `cb` function to be called with a different argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cb` function to be called with a different argument if `ended` is `true`.

DONE.
