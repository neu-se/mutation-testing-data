Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListener.call(null, progress);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the context in which `progressListener` is called, potentially leading to different results if `progressListener` relies on its `this` context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListener.apply(null, [progress, 'extraArg']);
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an extra argument to the call, which may cause `progressListener` to behave incorrectly if it does not expect or handle additional parameters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListener(progress, progress);
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes the `progress` value twice to `progressListener`, which may lead to unintended consequences if `progressListener` is designed to handle two different arguments.

DONE.
