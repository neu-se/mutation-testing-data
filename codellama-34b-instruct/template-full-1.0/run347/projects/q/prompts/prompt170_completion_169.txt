  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return isInternalFrame(<PLACEHOLDER>) && !isNodeFrame(line) && line;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isInternalFrame` function to be executed, which would return a different value than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return isInternalFrame(<PLACEHOLDER>) || !isNodeFrame(line) && line;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isInternalFrame` function to be executed, which would return a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return isInternalFrame(undefined <PLACEHOLDER>) && !isNodeFrame(line) && line;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isInternalFrame` function to be executed with `undefined` as the first argument, which would return a different value than the original code.

DONE.
