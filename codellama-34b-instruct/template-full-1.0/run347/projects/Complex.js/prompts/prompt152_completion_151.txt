  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` method checks if a value is NaN, whereas `isInfinite` checks if a value is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if `a` is not equal to 0, without considering the possibility of NaN or Infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Number.isFinite(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `a` is not a finite value, which includes NaN and Infinity.

DONE.
