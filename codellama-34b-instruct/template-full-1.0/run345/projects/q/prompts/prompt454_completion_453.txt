  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(no stack) " + reason.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was not adding the ".stack" property to the reason object, which is a string representing the stack trace. By adding this property, the new code would produce a different result, which makes the test fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(no stack) " + reason.message
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was not adding the ".message" property to the reason object, which is a string representing the reason for the rejection. By adding this property, the new code would produce a different result, which makes the test fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(no stack) " + reason
```
This would result in different behavior because the reason object is not a string, but an object with a "stack" property that contains a string representing the stack trace. By adding this property, the new code would produce a different result,
