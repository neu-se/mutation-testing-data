  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromise` checks if the value is a promise, while `!` negates the value, which would return true if the value is not a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromise` checks if the value is a promise, while `===` checks if the value is equal to `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromise` checks if the value is a promise, while `===` checks if the value is equal to `null`.

DONE.
