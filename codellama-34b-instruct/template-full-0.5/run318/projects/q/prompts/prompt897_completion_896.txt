  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with itself as the reason, rather than the error that was intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("rejected"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a different error message than the one that was intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the rejection reason, rather than the value that was intended.

DONE.
