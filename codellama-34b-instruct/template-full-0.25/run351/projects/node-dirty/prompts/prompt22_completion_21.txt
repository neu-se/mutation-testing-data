  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(() => { if (cb) cb(); this.emit('drain'); }, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` is used instead of `setImmediate`, which means that the callback will be executed after a delay of at least 0 milliseconds, whereas `setImmediate` would execute the callback immediately after the current execution context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.nextTick(() => { if (cb) cb(); this.emit('drain'); });
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.nextTick` is used instead of `setImmediate`, which means that the callback will be executed in the next tick of the event loop, whereas `setImmediate` would execute the callback immediately after the current execution context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (cb) cb(); this.emit('drain');
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback is executed immediately
