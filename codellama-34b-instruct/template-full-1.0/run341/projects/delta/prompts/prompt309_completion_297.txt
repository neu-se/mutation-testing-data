  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw Error('diff() called with non-document');
```
This would result in a runtime error when `diff()` is called, as the exception would be thrown before any code that would have executed later in the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Delta();
```
This would result in an empty delta being returned from `diff()`, meaning that the function effectively does nothing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return applyDiff(null, null);
```
This would result in a runtime error, as `applyDiff()` expects valid `Delta` objects as its arguments, but `null` is being passed instead.

DONE.
