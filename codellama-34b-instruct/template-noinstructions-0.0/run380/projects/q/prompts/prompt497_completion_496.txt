  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `reason` would pass the reason for the rejection to the `untrackRejection` function, while the new code fragment `null` would pass `null` instead, which would not be tracked as an unhandled rejection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `reason` would pass the reason for the rejection to the `untrackRejection` function, while the new code fragment `undefined` would pass `undefined` instead, which would not be tracked as an unhandled rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Test error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `reason` would pass the reason for the rejection to the `untrackRejection` function, while the new code fragment `throw new Error("Test error")` would throw an error instead,
