  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This change will cause the `map` function to return `null` instead of the expected value, which will likely cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This change will cause the `map` function to return `undefined` instead of the expected value, which will likely cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('Test error')
```
This change will cause the `map` function to throw an error instead of returning the expected value, which will likely cause the test to fail.

DONE.
