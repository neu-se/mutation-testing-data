Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete && typeof op.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the logic to require both `op.delete` to be truthy and `op.retain` to be a number, which would prevent certain operations from being executed when either condition is not met.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `op.retain` is strictly `null`, which would ignore any cases where `op.retain` is a number or an object, potentially leading to incorrect handling of operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `op.insert` is strictly `undefined`, which would not account for cases where `op.retain` is a number, thus altering the flow of the logic and potentially skipping necessary operations.

DONE.
