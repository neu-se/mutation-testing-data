  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function would be called with a `null` argument, which could cause an error or have unintended consequences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function would be called with a new `Error` object, which could cause an error or have unintended consequences.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function would be called with the `promise` object, which could cause an error or have unintended consequences.

DONE.
