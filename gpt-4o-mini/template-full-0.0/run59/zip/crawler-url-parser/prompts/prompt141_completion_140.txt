Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'//'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the path normalization logic, potentially leading to incorrect URL comparisons where paths that should be considered equivalent are treated as different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/index.html'
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a specific file name in the path, which could cause URLs that are intended to be treated as the same (e.g., `/` and `/index.html`) to be treated as different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/..'
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a relative path that moves up one directory, which could lead to incorrect evaluations of URL hierarchy and relationships, affecting the determination of whether URLs are at the same level, sublevel, or uplevel.

DONE.
