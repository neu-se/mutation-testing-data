 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce` function would always execute the callback function starting from the first index, regardless of whether the current index is an own property of the array or not. This is because the `in` operator checks for the existence of a property (including inherited ones) on an object, and `true` is a truthy value that would always satisfy the condition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
index < this.length
