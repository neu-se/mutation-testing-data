  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` event is not emitted when the read stream is closed, which could cause issues for code that is expecting to handle errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` event is not emitted when the read stream is closed, which could cause issues for code that is expecting to handle the closing of the stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'read_error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read_error` event is not emitted when the read stream is closed, which could cause issues for code that is expecting to handle errors related to reading from the stream.

DONE.
