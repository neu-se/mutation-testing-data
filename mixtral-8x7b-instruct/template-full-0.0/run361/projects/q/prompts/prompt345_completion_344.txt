 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.reject(new Error('Replacement error'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the rejection would now include an error message 'Replacement error' instead of the original 'exception'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned value would be an integer instead of a rejected promise, which could cause unexpected behavior in the calling code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned value would be a function instead of a rejected promise, which could cause unexpected behavior in the calling code.

DONE.
