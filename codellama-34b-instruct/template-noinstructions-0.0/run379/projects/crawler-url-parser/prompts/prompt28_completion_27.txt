  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\.*\/|^(?!localhost)\w+:/.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is checking for the presence of a protocol (e.g. "http:") at the beginning of the URL, but the replacement code fragment does not include this check.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\.*\/|^(?!localhost)\w+:/.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is checking for the presence of a protocol (e.g. "http:") at the beginning of the URL, but the replacement code fragment does not include this check.
