  Sure, here are three options for mutating the code:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"%"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `%` operator has different precedence than the `@` operator, and would result in different expressions being evaluated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"|"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `|` operator has different precedence than the `@` operator, and would result in different expressions being evaluated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"++"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `++` operator has different precedence than the `@` operator, and would result in different expressions being evaluated.

DONE.
