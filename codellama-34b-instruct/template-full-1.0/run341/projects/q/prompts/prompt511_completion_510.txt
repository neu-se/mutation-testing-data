  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp, (args - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would not produce the same results as the original code fragment. The code would now produce a wrong value of `promise` which could cause a different execution and identify a different weakness in the test suite. 

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp, [args]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now produce a wrong value of `promise` which would lead the test suite to execute a different path and find a different weakness.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp, ++args
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now produce a wrong value of `promise` that could lead to execute a different path and find a different weakness.

DONE.
