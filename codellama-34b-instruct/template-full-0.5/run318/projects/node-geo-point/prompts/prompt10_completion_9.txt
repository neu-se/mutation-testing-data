  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `coordinates` property is present on the `point` object, but it would not check if the `coordinates` property is an array with two elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length !== 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `coordinates` array has a length of 2, but it would not check if the `coordinates` property is present on the `point` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates[0] !== point.coordinates[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the first and second elements of the `coordinates` array are not equal, but it would not check if the `coordinates` property is present on the `point` object or if it has a length of 2.
