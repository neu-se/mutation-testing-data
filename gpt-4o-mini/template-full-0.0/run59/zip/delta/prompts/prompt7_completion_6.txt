Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes = Object.keys(b).reduce<AttributeMap>((copy, key) => { return copy; }, {});
```
This would result in different behavior because it effectively clears the `attributes` object, resulting in an empty object regardless of the contents of `b`, which would lead to loss of all attributes from `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes = cloneDeep(a);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would copy the attributes from `a` instead of `b`, which means that the resulting `attributes` would not reflect the intended composition of `b` and would instead be based solely on `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes = { ...attributes, ...a };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would merge the attributes from `a` into `attributes`, potentially overwriting values from `b` instead of preserving them, which changes the intended logic of the `compose` function.

DONE.
