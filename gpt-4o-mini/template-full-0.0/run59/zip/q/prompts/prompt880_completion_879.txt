Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise immediately instead of providing a Node-style callback resolver, potentially leading to unhandled promise rejections if the original function expects a callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to reject immediately instead of resolving it, which would not align with the expected behavior of a Node-style function that should call back with a result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `undefined` as the callback resolver, leading to a failure in the promise resolution process, as the Node-style function would not be able to call back correctly.

DONE.
