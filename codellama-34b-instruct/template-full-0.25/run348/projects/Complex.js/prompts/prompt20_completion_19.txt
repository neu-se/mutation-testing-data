  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < 3000 && b < 3000 && a > 0 && b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional conditions `a > 0` and `b > 0` would cause the function to return `NaN` for any negative values of `a` or `b`, whereas the original code would return a complex number with a negative real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < 3000 && b < 3000 && a !== 0 && b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional conditions `a !== 0` and `b !== 0` would cause the function to return `NaN` for any zero values of `a` or `b`, whereas the original code would return a complex number with a real part of zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < 3000 && b < 3000 &&
