  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop === undefined || match[index + 1] === prop
```
This would result in different behavior because `===` checks for strict equality, while `!==` checks for non-strict inequality. In this case, the code is checking if `match[index + 1]` is not equal to `prop`, so using `===` instead would result in the condition always being false, which would change the behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop === undefined || match[index + 1] !== prop
```
This would result in different behavior because `!=` checks for loose inequality, while `===` checks for strict equality. In this case, the code is checking if `match[index + 1]` is not equal to `prop`, so using `!=` instead would result in the condition always being true, which would change the behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop === undefined || match[index + 1]
