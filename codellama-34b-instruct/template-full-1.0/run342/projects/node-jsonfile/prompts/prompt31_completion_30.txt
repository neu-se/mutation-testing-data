  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.encoding` is not a function and would cause an error when `stringify` is called with it as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.throws
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.throws` is a boolean and would cause `JSON.parse` to throw an error if the file contents cannot be parsed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.reviver
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.reviver` is a function that is called on each key-value pair during JSON parsing, and could potentially change the behavior of the application.

DONE.
