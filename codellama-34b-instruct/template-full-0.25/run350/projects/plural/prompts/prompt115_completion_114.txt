  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
illnesses.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the word is in the `illnesses` array, while this new code fragment is checking the length of the `illnesses` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
illnesses[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the word is in the `illnesses` array, while this new code fragment is checking the first element of the `illnesses` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
illnesses.indexOf(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the word is in the `illnesses` array, while this new code fragment is checking the index of the word in the `illnesses` array.

DONE.
