  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `for` loop to iterate over the entire array, even if the `index` is greater than the `length` of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `for` loop to iterate over the entire array, even if the `index` is less than the `length` of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index === this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `for` loop to iterate over the entire array, even if the `index` is equal to the `length` of the array.

DONE.
