Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly resolve the promise instead of rejecting it when an error occurs, leading to a successful resolution even in the presence of an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the notify function instead of the reject function, which means that the promise would not handle errors correctly and would not reject as expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `undefined` as the second argument to the resolver function, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors when the promise is resolved, as it would not provide a valid reject function.

DONE.
