  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a file path as a string, while the replaced code would pass a string literal "hello".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
123
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a file path as a string, while the replaced code would pass an integer 123.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a file path as a string, while the replaced code would pass a null value.

DONE.
