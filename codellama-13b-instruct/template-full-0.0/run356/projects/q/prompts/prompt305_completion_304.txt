  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate twice as many times as the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate in reverse order as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i *= 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate twice as many times as the original code, but the value of `i` would be doubled each iteration.

DONE.
