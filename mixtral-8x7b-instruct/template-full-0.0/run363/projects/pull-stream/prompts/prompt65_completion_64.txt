 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` function would always pass `true` as the first argument to the callback supplied by the user, even when the stream ends without error. Originally, the argument passed to the callback would be `null` in case of a successful stream end.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(false)
