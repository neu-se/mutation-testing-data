  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is expecting a value to be passed as the first argument, but `null` would not provide any value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is expecting a value to be passed as the first argument, but `undefined` would not provide any value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is expecting a value to be passed as the first argument, but `0` would not provide any value.

DONE.
