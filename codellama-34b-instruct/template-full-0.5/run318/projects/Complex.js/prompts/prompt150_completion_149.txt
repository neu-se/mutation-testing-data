  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'] && z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `mul` function to always return `Complex['NAN']`, even if the input values are not infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite'] && z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `mul` function to always return `Complex['INFINITY']`, even if the input values are not infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'] || z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `mul` function to always return `Complex['INFINITY']`, even if the input values are not infinite.

DONE.
