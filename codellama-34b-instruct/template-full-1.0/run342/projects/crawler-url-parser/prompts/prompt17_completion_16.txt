  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement code fragment will trim the fragment separator "#" and the query string "?" instead of just the fragment separator "#".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/g, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement code fragment will globally replace the fragment separator "#" and the query string "?" instead of just the fragment separator "#".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
#comment
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement code fragment will cause a runtime error, as "#comment" is not a valid JavaScript comment syntax.

DONE.
