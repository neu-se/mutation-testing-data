  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type !== 'Point' || !Array.isArray(point.coordinates)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `type` property is not equal to `'Point'` or if the `coordinates` property is not an array, which is different from the original code fragment that checks if the `type` property is not equal to `'Point'` or if the `coordinates` property does not exist.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!point.hasOwnProperty('type') || !point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates') || point.type !== 'Point'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `type` property does not exist or if the `coordinates` property does not exist, or if the `type` property is not equal to `'Point'`, which is different from the original code fragment that checks if the `type` property is not equal to `'Point'` or if the `coordinates` property does not exist.
