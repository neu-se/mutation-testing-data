  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[1], ref[0]
```
This change swaps the order of the arguments passed to the `pull` function, which could potentially cause a different behavior in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[2]
```
This change passes a different argument to the `pull` function, which could also potentially cause a different behavior in the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2]
```
This change passes all three arguments to the `pull` function, which could potentially cause a different behavior in the program.

DONE.
