  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `onAbort` function, while the new code fragment is a call to the `onAbort` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort(abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not pass any arguments to the `onAbort` function, while the new code fragment passes the `abort` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `abort` argument to the `onAbort` function, while the new code fragment passes `null` as the argument.

DONE.
