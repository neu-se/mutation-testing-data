Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'$$'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would escape the '$' character with another '$' instead of a single '$', potentially leading to incorrect string replacement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the escaping of the '$' character altogether, potentially causing issues with string replacement if the target path contains '$' characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
targetPath
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the current path with the target path instead of escaping the '$' character, potentially causing incorrect file path construction.

DONE.
