  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.ops.length - 1` would return the length of the `ops` array minus 1, while `this.index` would return the current index of the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length - this.index
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.ops.length - this.index` would return the length of the `ops` array minus the current index of the iterator, while `this.index` would return the current index of the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.ops.length` would return the length of the `ops` array, while `this.index` would return the current index of the iterator.

DONE.
