This would result in different behavior because it would use the `indexOf` method of the `unhandledRejections` array instead of the `array_indexOf` utility function, which could lead to incorrect index being returned if the array contains negative values or non-integer values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `indexOf` method of a new array instead of the `array_indexOf` utility function, which could lead to incorrect index being returned if the array contains negative values or non-integer values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unhandledRejections.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `includes` method of the `unhandledRejections` array instead of the `array_indexOf` utility function, which would return `-1` if the promise is not present in the
