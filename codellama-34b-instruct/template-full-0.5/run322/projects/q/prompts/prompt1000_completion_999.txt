  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` rejects the promise, while `deferred.resolve` resolves it, which would cause the promise to be fulfilled instead of rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` rejects the promise, while `deferred.notify` sends a notification to the promise's progress listeners, which would not cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.throw
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` rejects the promise, while `deferred.throw` throws an error, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a different error than the one intended by the developer.

DONE.
