 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
cb && cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because if `cb` is truthy but falsy (e.g., non-empty string, non-zero number, or a non-null object with no `call` method), the callback would not be invoked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
setImmediate(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would be wrapped in a `setImmediate`, making it asynchronous, which is different from the original synchronous behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.emit('drain')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` callback would not be called, and the 'drain' event would be emitted instead.

DONE.
