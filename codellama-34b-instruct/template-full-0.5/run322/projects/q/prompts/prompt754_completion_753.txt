  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("keys", [])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would dispatch the "keys" event with an empty array, instead of the expected array of promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("keys", [1, 2, 3])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would dispatch the "keys" event with a different array of values, instead of the expected array of promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("keys", [promises])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would dispatch the "keys" event with an array containing a single element, which is the array of promises, instead of the expected array of promises.

DONE.
