  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goat'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'goat' does not satisfy the regular expression for 'geese' in the plural rule, so the function would return 'goat' instead of 'gooses'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'ginx'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'ginx' does not satisfy the regular expression for 'geese' in the plural rule, so the function would return 'ginx' instead of 'ggeese'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'geese'.substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return 'ese' instead of 'geese'.

DONE.
