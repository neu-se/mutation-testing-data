 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `descriptor[op].apply()` call would now be passing an empty array as the `args` parameter, which would likely cause the applied method to behave incorrectly due to missing arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `descriptor[op].apply()` call would now be passing `null` as the `args` parameter, which would likely cause the applied method to throw a `TypeError` due to expecting an array-like object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ foo: 'bar' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `descriptor[op].apply()` call would now be passing an object with a `foo` property as the `args` parameter, which would likely cause the applied method to behave incorrectly due to expecting an array-like object.

DONE.
