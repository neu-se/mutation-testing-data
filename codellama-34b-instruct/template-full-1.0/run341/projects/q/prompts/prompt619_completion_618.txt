  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would be replaced with `delete`, which is a different method that has different behavior and would cause errors in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key, value]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would be replaced with `set`, which is a different method that has different behavior and would cause errors in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [key, value]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would be replaced with `post`, which is a different method that has different behavior and would cause errors in the code.

DONE.
