  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is a function that returns a promise, but `defer(null)` would return a promise that is already resolved with `null`, which would cause the `nfapply` method to reject with an error instead of resolving with the expected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is a function that returns a promise, but `defer(undefined)` would return a promise that is already resolved with `undefined`, which would cause the `nfapply` method to reject with an error instead of resolving with the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is a function that returns a promise, but `defer(new Error())` would return a promise that is already rejected with an error, which would
