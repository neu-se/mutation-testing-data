  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is an object and null is not, so the result of `deferred.promise.then` will be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is an object and `undefined` is not, so the result of `deferred.promise.then` will be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is an object and an empty array is not, so the result of `deferred.promise.then` will be different.

DONE.
