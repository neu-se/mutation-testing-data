  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-sinφ1 * cosδ + cosφ1 * sinδ * cosθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by `-sinφ1` would negate the effect of `cosφ1`, resulting in a different bearing calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ1 * cosδ + cosθ * sinδ * cosφ1
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by `cosθ` would change the sign of the bearing calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(sinφ1 * cosδ + cosθ * sinδ * cosφ1) * Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by `Math.PI` would greatly amplify the bearing calculation, leading to an inaccurate result.

DONE.
