  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `country === null` is a different condition than `!country`, which checks for the existence of the `country` variable. If `country` is not defined, `!country` would throw a reference error, while `country === null` would return `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `country === undefined` is a different condition than `!country`, which checks for the existence of the `country` variable. If `country` is not defined, `!country` would throw a reference error, while `country === undefined` would return `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof country === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof country === 'undefined'` is a different condition than `!country`, which checks for the existence of the `country` variable. If `country` is not defined, `!country
