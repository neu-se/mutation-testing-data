  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attr[key] !== base[key] || base[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is used instead of the `&&` operator, which changes the logic of the statement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attr[key] !== base[key] && base[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator is used instead of the `===` operator, which changes the logic of the statement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attr[key] === base[key] && base[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator is used instead of the `!==` operator, which changes the logic of the statement.

DONE.
