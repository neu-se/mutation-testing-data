  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-r
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `acos` function to compute the arccosine of a value, while the replaced code fragment uses the negative of the value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `acos` function to compute the arccosine of a value, while the replaced code fragment adds 1 to the value before computing the arccosine.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `acos` function to compute the arccosine of a value, while the replaced code fragment multiplies the value by 2 before computing the arccosine.

DONE.
