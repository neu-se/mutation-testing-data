  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.attributes = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attributes` property of `lastOp` would be set to `null`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` and the `else` block to be executed instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.attributes = newOp.attributes;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attributes` property of `lastOp` would be set to the value of the `attributes` property of `newOp`, which could be different from the original value of `lastOp.attributes`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.attributes = { ...lastOp.attributes, ...newOp.attributes };
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attributes` property of `lastOp` would be set to a new object that combines the properties of `lastOp.attributes` and `newOp.attributes`, which could result in a different
