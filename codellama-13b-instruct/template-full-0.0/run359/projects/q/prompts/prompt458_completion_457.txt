  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) {
    return value;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the promise itself, while this code fragment returns a new promise that resolves to the value of the original promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) {
    return value.then(function (value) {
        return value;
    });
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the promise itself, while this code fragment returns a new promise that resolves to the value of the original promise, which is then resolved to the value of the original promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) {
    return value.then(function (value) {
        return value.then(function (value) {
            return value;
        });
    });
})
```
This would result in
