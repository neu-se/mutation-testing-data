  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain > firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always be true if `firstOther.retain` is greater than `firstLeft`, even if `firstLeft > 0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain - firstLeft !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always be true if `firstOther.retain` and `firstLeft` have different values, even if `firstLeft > 0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain - firstLeft > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always be true if `firstOther.retain` is greater than 1 + `firstLeft`, even if `firstLeft > 0`.

DONE.
