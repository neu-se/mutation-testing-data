  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-x
```
This would result in different behavior because the correct result of the `cos()` function is positive, while the incorrect result of `-x` is negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the correct result of the `cos()` function is less than 1, while the incorrect result of `x + 1` is greater than 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(x) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the correct result of the `cos()` function is less than 1, while the incorrect result of `cos(x) + 1` is greater than 1.

DONE.
