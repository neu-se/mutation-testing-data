Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the condition, causing the loop to execute only when there are no more operations to iterate over, which is the opposite of the intended logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the length of the next operation is greater than zero, which may lead to skipping valid operations if the next operation has a length of zero, thus altering the flow of processing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to only continue the loop if the next operation is a delete operation, potentially ignoring other types of operations (like inserts) and leading to incomplete processing of the delta.

DONE.
