Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use a length of 0 for the `thisIter.peekLength()` call, potentially causing the `retain` operation to be skipped or incorrectly processed, leading to incorrect delta results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly increase the length used for the `retain` operation, potentially causing an out-of-bounds error or incorrect retention of operations in the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reduce the length used for the `retain` operation by 1, which could lead to missing out on retaining the last operation, thus altering the expected output of the delta.

DONE.
