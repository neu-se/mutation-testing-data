  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type === 'Point' && point.coordinates.length === 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `point` object has the `type` and `coordinates` properties, while the new code fragment checks if the `type` property is equal to `'Point'` and the `coordinates` property is an array with two elements. If the `point` object has the `type` and `coordinates` properties but with different values, the new code fragment would produce a different result than the original code fragment.

DONE.
