  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(Op.length(otherOp), Op.length(thisOp))
```
This would result in different behavior because it reverses the order of the retain parameters, which changes the behavior of the transform method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(1, Op.length(thisOp))
```
This would result in different behavior because it fixes the first parameter of retain to 1, which changes the number of characters retained.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(baseOp.length, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it fixes the second parameter of retain to 1, which changes the number of characters retained.

DONE.
