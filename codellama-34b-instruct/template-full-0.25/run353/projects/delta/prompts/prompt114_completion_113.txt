  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(accum, curr, index) => accum + curr.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the order of operations in the reduce function, potentially causing the final result to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(accum, curr, index) => accum - curr.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the order of operations in the reduce function, potentially causing the final result to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(accum, curr, index) => accum + curr.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the order of operations in the reduce function, potentially causing the final result to be incorrect.

DONE.
