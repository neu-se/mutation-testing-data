  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
drain(null, done)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` function is called with `null` as the first argument, which is not the same as the original code where `drain` is called with no arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
drain(done, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` function is called with `done` as the first argument and `null` as the second argument, which is not the same as the original code where `drain` is called with no arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
drain(done)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` function is called with `done` as the first argument, which is not the same as the original code where `drain` is called with no arguments.

DONE.
