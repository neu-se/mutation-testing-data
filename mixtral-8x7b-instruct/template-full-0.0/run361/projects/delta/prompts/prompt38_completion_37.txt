 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
(<any>b)[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the property of the `b` object using a string key, which could lead to unexpected behavior if `b` has a `toString` method or if the key is dynamically generated and contains special characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
b.hasOwnProperty(key) ? b[key] : undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only include properties that are directly owned by the `b` object, excluding properties inherited from its prototype chain. This could lead to missing or incorrect values in the resulting attribute map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
(b as any)[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat `b` as an any-type object, bypassing TypeScript's type checking and allowing for potential errors or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
