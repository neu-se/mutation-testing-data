  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [key]: tzs[key].deprecated }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an object with the same keys as the original object, but with the values set to the `deprecated` property of each timezone object, rather than the timezone object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [key]: tzs[key].name }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an object with the same keys as the original object, but with the values set to the `name` property of each timezone object, rather than the timezone object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [key]: tzs[key].timezones }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an object with the same keys as the original object, but with the values set to the `timezones` property of each timezone object, rather than the timezone object itself.

DONE.
