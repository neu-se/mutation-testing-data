  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `undefined`, whereas the original code would return the value of the `callback` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `0`, whereas the original code would return the value of the `callback` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `null`, whereas the original code would return the value of the `callback` function.

DONE.
