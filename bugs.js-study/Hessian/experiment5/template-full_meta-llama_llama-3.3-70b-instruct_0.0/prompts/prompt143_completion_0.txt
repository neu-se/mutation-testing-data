Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
obj === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if the object is null, but not if it's undefined, and also doesn't consider the case where the object has a `$class` property and a null or undefined `$` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!obj
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the object is falsy (i.e., null, undefined, 0, "", etc.), which is a broader condition than the original check.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
is.string(obj.$class) && !obj.$
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if the object has a `$class` property and if the `$` property is falsy, but doesn't consider the case where the object is null or undefined.

DONE.
