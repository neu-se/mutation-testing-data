  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__esModule": false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `__esModule` property is now set to `false`, which could cause the module to be loaded differently by some module loaders.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__esModule": true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `__esModule` property is now set to `true`, which could cause the module to be loaded differently by some module loaders.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__esModule": undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `__esModule` property is now set to `undefined`, which could cause the module to be loaded differently by some module loaders.

DONE.
