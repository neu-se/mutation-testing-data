  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peek()` returns the next element in the iteration without advancing the iterator, whereas `otherIter.next()` advances the iterator and returns the next element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peek(length)` returns the next `length` elements in the iteration without advancing the iterator, whereas `otherIter.next()` advances the iterator and returns the next element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next(length)` advances the iterator and returns the next `length` elements, whereas `otherIter.peek()` returns the next element without advancing the iterator.

DONE.
