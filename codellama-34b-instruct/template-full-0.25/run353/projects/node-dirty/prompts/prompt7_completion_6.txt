  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key++
```
This would result in different behavior because the key would be incremented by 1, which could cause the code to access the wrong data in the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key--
```
This would result in different behavior because the key would be decremented by 1, which could cause the code to access the wrong data in the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key = 'newKey'
```
This would result in different behavior because the key would be changed to a new value, which could cause the code to access the wrong data in the map.

DONE.
