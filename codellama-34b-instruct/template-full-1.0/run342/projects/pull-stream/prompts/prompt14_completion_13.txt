  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i >= length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute, as i is initialized to 0, and length is the number of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one less time than the original code, potentially missing the last argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < 2 * length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate twice as many times as the original code, potentially causing errors or infinite loops.

DONE.
