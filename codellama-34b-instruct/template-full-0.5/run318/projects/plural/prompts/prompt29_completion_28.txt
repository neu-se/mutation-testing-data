  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/thesis$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'es' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/thesis$/i` matches the word "thesis" only at the end of the string, whereas the original regular expression `/thesis|crisis/i` matches both "thesis" and "crisis" regardless of their position in the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/thesis|crisis/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ies' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement function returns "ies" instead of "es" for the word "thesis".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/thesis|crisis/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2)
