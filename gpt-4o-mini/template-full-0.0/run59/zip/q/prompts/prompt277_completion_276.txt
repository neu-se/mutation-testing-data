Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length < 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise only if fewer than two arguments are provided, which is the opposite of the original condition that checks for more than two arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only resolve the promise if no arguments are provided at all, ignoring cases where one or more arguments are passed, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length !== 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise for any number of arguments except exactly two, whereas the original code specifically checks for more than two arguments to determine the resolution.

DONE.
