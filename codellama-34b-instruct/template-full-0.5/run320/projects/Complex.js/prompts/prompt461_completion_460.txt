  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor(a)` would always round down to the nearest integer, while `Math.abs(a)` would return the absolute value of `a`, which could be a non-integer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil(a)` would always round up to the nearest integer, while `Math.abs(a)` would return the absolute value of `a`, which could be a non-integer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.round(a)` would round to the nearest integer, while `Math.abs(a)` would return the absolute value of `a`, which could be a non-integer.

DONE.
