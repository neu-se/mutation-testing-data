  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would immediately resolve the promise with the new value, whereas `deferred.notify` would only update the progress of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would immediately reject the promise with the new value, whereas `deferred.notify` would only update the progress of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.progress
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.progress` would only update the progress of the promise, whereas `deferred.notify` would immediately resolve or reject the promise with the new value.

DONE.
