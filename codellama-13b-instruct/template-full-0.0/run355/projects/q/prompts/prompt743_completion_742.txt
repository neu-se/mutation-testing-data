  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) {
    return value;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the promise, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the value returned by the callback function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) {
    return Q(value);
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the promise, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the value returned by the callback function, which is a promise for the value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) {
    return Q.resolve(value);
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the promise, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the value returned by the callback function, which is a promise for the value.
