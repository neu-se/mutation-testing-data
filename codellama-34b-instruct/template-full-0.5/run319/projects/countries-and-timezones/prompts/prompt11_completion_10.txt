  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] = { [country]: { current: [], all: [] } }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new object with a single property, rather than updating the existing object with the new property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country][country] = { current: [], all: [] }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new property on the existing object, rather than updating the existing property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] = { current: [], all: [] }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would update the existing object with a new property, rather than creating a new object with a single property.

DONE.
