  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 1)])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method is not defined in the `Promise.prototype`, so it would throw a `TypeError` when invoked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("apply", [name, array_slice(arguments, 1)])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is not defined in the `Promise.prototype`, so it would throw a `TypeError` when invoked.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("resolve", [name, array_slice(arguments, 1)])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` method is not defined in the `Promise.prototype`, so it would throw a `TypeError` when invoked.

DONE.
