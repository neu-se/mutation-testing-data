  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.async` is a function that returns a new function, whereas `makeGenerator` is a function that returns a generator object. Using `Q.async` instead of `makeGenerator` would cause the code to execute differently, potentially leading to different results or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(function* () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.async` expects a function that returns a generator object, whereas `function* () {}` is a generator function that returns a generator object. Using `Q.async` with a generator function instead of a function that returns a generator object would cause the code to execute differently, potentially leading to different results or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.async` expects a function that returns a generator object, whereas
