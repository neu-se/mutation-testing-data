  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is a variable, but the new code fragment `-b` is a unary minus operator applied to the variable `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is a variable, but the new code fragment `b + 1` is an expression that adds 1 to the variable `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is a variable, but the new code fragment `Math.sin(b)` is a function call that applies the sine function to the variable `b`.

DONE.
