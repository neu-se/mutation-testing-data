  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp['retain']
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp` is an object, and the `retain` property is being accessed using bracket notation instead of dot notation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops[0].retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `other` is an object, and the `ops` property is being accessed using dot notation, which is invalid.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[0].retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` is an object, and the `ops` property is being accessed using dot notation, which is invalid.

DONE.
