  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp && typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' && lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!lastOp.attributes` check would be removed, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to true when `lastOp` is an object with a `retain` property of type number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp && typeof lastOp.retain === 'string' && !lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof lastOp.retain` check would be changed to check for a string instead of a number, and the `!lastOp.attributes` check would be kept.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp && typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' && lastOp.attributes.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the check for `lastOp.attributes.length > 0` would be added, causing the `
