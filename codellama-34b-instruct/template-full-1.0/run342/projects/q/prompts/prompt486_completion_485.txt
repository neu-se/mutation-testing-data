  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections = []
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resetUnhandledRejections` function would no longer be called, which means that the `unhandledRejections` array would not be cleared, and any unhandled rejections would not be reported or tracked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.length = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unhandledReasons` array would not be cleared, and any unhandled rejections would not be reported or tracked.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections = []
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array would not be cleared, and any reported unhandled rejections would not be remembered or tracked.

DONE.
