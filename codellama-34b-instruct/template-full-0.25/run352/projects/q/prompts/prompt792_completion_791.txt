  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, so the promise would be rejected even if the original promise was fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, so the promise would be rejected even if the original promise was fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, null
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejected` is a truthy value, so the promise would be fulfilled even if the original promise was rejected.

DONE.
