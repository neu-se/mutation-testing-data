  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
gettype(linkurl, pageurl, "buggy")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gettype` function would be called with an additional argument, which would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
gettype(linkurl, pageurl, gettype)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gettype` function would be called with a different set of arguments, which would cause it to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
gettype(linkurl, pageurl, gettype.bind(null, linkurl, pageurl))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gettype` function would be called with a different set of arguments, which would cause it to return a different value.

DONE.
