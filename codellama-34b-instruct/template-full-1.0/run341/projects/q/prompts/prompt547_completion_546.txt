  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw error
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throw` statement will cause the function to exit immediately and throw an error, whereas the original code will catch the error and return a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Promise.reject(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code will return a rejected promise, whereas the new code will return a promise that is already in the rejected state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(error).throw()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code will return a promise that is rejected with the specified error, whereas the new code will return a promise that is rejected with a new error that is the result of throwing the specified error.

DONE.
