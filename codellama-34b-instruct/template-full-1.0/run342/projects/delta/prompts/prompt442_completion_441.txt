  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `substr` method to start from a different position than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `substr` method to extract a different length than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `substr` method to start from the beginning of the string, regardless of the intended offset.

DONE.
