Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
srcFile
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the source file exists instead of the destination file, potentially leading to unexpected behavior when trying to overwrite the source file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
destFile + '.tmp'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the existence of a temporary file instead of the actual destination file, which may not be the intended behavior and could lead to incorrect handling of file overwrites.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/dev/null'
```
This would result in different behavior because it always checks for the existence of a special file (/dev/null) that is unlikely to exist in the context of this function, potentially causing the function to always assume the destination file does not exist and proceed with the copy operation without checking for actual file overwrites.

DONE.
