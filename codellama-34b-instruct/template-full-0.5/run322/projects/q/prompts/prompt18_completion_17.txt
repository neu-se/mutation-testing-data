  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
head.task = void 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because `head.task` is not a function, so calling it as a function would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
head.task = function() { throw new Error("Testing mutation"); };
```
This would result in different behavior because the new function would throw an error when called, which would cause the `runSingle` function to exit early and skip the rest of the tasks in the queue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
head.task = function() { console.log("Testing mutation"); };
```
This would result in different behavior because the new function would log a message to the console, which would not affect the behavior of the rest of the code.

DONE.
