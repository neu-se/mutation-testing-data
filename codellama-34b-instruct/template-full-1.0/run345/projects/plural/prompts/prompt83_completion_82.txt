  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'horse'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would pluralize the word "mouse," but the new code fragment would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'x'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would pluralize the word "mouse," but the new code fragment would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
save(kafka, 'mouse')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would pluralize the word "mouse," but the new code fragment would not.

DONE.
