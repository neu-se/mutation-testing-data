  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { throw new Error('Empty lines never appear in a healthy database') }
```
This would result in different behavior because now the error message is different from the original code, so any test that is checking for the specific error message may not pass.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new TypeError('Empty lines never appear in a healthy database')
```
This would result in different behavior because now the error is a TypeError, instead of an Error, so any test that is checking for the specific error type may not pass.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Empty lines never appear in a healthy database' + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because now the error message is not exactly the same as the original code, so any test that is checking for the specific error message may not pass.

DONE.
