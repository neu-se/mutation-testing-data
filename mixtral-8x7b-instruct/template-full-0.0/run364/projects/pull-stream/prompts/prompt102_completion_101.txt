 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
console.error
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.error` outputs to the error stream instead of the log stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
alert
```
This would result in different behavior because `alert` displays a message box instead of logging the data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
process.stderr.write
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.stderr.write` writes to the standard error stream instead of logging the data.

DONE.
