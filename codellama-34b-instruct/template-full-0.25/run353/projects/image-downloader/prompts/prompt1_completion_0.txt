  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `options.url` is falsy, while this new fragment checks if it is `undefined`. This could cause the function to behave differently if `options.url` is set to `null` or `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!options.url.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `options.url` is falsy, while this new fragment checks if its length is 0. This could cause the function to behave differently if `options.url` is an empty string or an array with no elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url.indexOf('http') !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `options.url` is falsy, while this new fragment checks if it does not start with the string "http". This could cause
