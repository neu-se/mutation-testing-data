  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.attributes` is an object, and `op.attributes[0]` would return the first attribute of the object, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes["name"]
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.attributes` is an object, and `op.attributes["name"]` would return the value of the "name" attribute of the object, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes.name
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.attributes` is an object, and `op.attributes.name` would return the value of the "name" attribute of the object, which may not be the desired behavior.

DONE.
