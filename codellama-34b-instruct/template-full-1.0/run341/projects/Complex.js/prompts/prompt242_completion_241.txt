  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['im']` is a different property of the `Complex` object than `this['re']`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['abs']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['abs']()` is a method call that returns the magnitude of the `Complex` object, while `this['re']` is a property that returns the real part of the `Complex` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['arg']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['arg']()` is a method call that returns the angle of the `Complex` object, while `this['re']` is a property that returns the real part of the `Complex` object.

DONE.
