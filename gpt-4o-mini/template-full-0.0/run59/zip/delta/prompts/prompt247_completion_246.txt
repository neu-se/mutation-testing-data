Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause one extra character to be deleted than intended, potentially leading to incorrect document state after the diff operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would effectively ignore the length of the delete operation, resulting in no characters being deleted from the document, which could lead to inconsistencies in the expected output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the next operation in the iterator instead of the intended length, which could lead to incorrect deletions or unexpected results in the delta operations.

DONE.
