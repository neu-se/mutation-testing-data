  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the forward slash as a separator, while the replaced code fragment would use an empty string as a separator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the forward slash as a separator, while the replaced code fragment would use a backslash as a separator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a string as a separator, while the replaced code fragment would use a random number as a separator.

DONE.
