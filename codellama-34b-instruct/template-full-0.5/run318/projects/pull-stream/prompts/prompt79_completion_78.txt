  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `next(null)` would cause the `while` loop to exit immediately, whereas the original code fragment `next()` would continue the loop until `loop` is set to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `next(undefined)` would cause the `while` loop to exit immediately, whereas the original code fragment `next()` would continue the loop until `loop` is set to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because `next(false)` would cause the `while` loop to exit immediately, whereas the original code fragment `next()` would continue the loop until `loop` is set to `false`.

DONE.
