  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'-'
```
This would result in different behavior because '-' is a different operator than '/' and would change the URL parsing results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because ' ' is a different character than '/' and would change the URL parsing results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'.'
```
This would result in different behavior because '.' is a different character than '/' and would change the URL parsing results.

DONE.
