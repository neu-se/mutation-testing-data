  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` is a different function that checks if an object is promise-like, meaning it has a `then` method, whereas `isPromise` checks if an object is an instance of the `Promise` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFulfilled` checks if a promise is fulfilled, whereas `isPromise` checks if an object is an instance of the `Promise` class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `isRejected` checks if a promise is rejected, whereas `isPromise` checks if an object is an instance of the `Promise` class.

DONE.
