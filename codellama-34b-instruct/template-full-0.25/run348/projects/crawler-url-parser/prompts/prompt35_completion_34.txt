  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr + "example.com"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append the string "example.com" to the current URL, which would cause the URL to be parsed incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace("http://", "https://")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the "http" protocol with "https", which could cause the URL to be parsed incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace("www.", "")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the "www." subdomain from the URL, which could cause the URL to be parsed incorrectly.

DONE.
