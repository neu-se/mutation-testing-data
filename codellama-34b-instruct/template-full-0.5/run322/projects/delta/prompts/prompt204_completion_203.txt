  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Delta(thisIter.rest().slice(1))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first element of the rest of the iterable, which could potentially cause the code to fail if it relies on that element being present.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Delta(thisIter.rest().slice(0, -1))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last element of the rest of the iterable, which could potentially cause the code to fail if it relies on that element being present.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Delta(thisIter.rest().slice(2))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first two elements of the rest of the iterable, which could potentially cause the code to fail if it relies on those elements being present.

DONE.
