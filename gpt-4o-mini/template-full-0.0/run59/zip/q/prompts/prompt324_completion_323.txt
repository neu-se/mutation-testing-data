Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fallback.apply(promise, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `apply` instead of `call`, which means that the `args` array will be treated as individual arguments rather than as a single array, potentially leading to unexpected results if `args` contains more than one element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(new Error("Operation not supported: " + op));
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly rejects the promise with a new error message instead of attempting to call the fallback function, which means that the promise will be rejected without any chance of executing the fallback logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op]();
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the method on the descriptor without passing any arguments, which could lead to errors if the method expects arguments, resulting in a failure to execute the intended operation correctly.

DONE.
