  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther != null &&
      typeof firstOther.retain === 'number' &&
      firstOther.attributes != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only considers the case where `firstOther.attributes` is `null`, but this replacement considers the case where `firstOther.attributes` is not `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther != null &&
      typeof firstOther.retain === 'number' &&
      firstOther.attributes != undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only considers the case where `firstOther.attributes` is `null`, but this replacement considers the case where `firstOther.attributes` is not `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther != null &&
      typeof firstOther.retain === 'number' &&
      firstOther.attributes.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original
