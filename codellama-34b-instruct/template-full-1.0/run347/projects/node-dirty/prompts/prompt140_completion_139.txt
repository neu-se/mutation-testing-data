  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._emit
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._emit` is not a function and would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
emit
```
This would result in different behavior because `emit` is not defined in the current scope and would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Dirty.emit
```
This would result in different behavior because `Dirty.emit` is not a function and would throw an error.

DONE.
