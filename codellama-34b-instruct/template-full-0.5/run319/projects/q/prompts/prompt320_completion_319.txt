  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op](promise, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the method directly, instead of using the `apply` method to call it with the `promise` and `args` arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op].call(promise, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the method with the `promise` object as the `this` value, instead of using the default `this` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op].bind(promise)(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new function that is bound to the `promise` object, and then call that function with the `args` argument.

DONE.
