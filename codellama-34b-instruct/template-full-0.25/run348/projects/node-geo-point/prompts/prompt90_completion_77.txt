  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(θ) * sin(δ) * cos(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication of `sin(θ)` and `sin(δ)` would introduce an additional factor that is not present in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(θ) * sin(δ) * cos(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication of `cos(θ)` and `sin(δ)` would introduce an additional factor that is not present in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(θ) * cos(δ) * cos(φ1)

This would result in different behavior because the multiplication of `sin(θ)` and `cos(δ)` would introduce an additional factor that is not present in the original code fragment.

DONE.
