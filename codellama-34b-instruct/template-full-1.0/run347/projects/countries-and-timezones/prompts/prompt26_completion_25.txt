  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dstOffset + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the offset would be increased by one, which would cause the daylight saving time offsets to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dstOffset - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the offset would be decreased by one, which would cause the daylight saving time offsets to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the daylight saving time offsets to always be zero, regardless of the actual offset.

DONE.
