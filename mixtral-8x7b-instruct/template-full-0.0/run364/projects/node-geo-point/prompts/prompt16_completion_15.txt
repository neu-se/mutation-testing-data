 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a random number instead of converting the input coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw a TypeError when trying to call a method on a null value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a function object instead of converting the input coordinates.

DONE.
