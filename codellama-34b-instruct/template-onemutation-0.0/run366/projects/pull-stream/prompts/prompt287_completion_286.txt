  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the `data` object, while the new code fragment returns `null`. This change would cause the `map` function to return a different value than expected, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the code that uses the `map` function.

DONE.
