  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fn.apply(this.thisp, this.args.concat([function(x, n) {}]));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the function that is being called, and the arguments that are being passed to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fn.apply(this.thisp, [this.args[0]]).fail(function(error) {}]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the function that is being called, and the arguments that are being passed to it, and it would also add an extra function that would be called in case of failure.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fn.call(this.thisp, this.args[0], function(x, n) {});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the function that is being called, and the arguments that are being passed to it, and it would also change the
