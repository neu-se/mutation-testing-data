  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).done
```
This would result in different behavior because `done` is a different method than `fail`, and it would not handle errors in the same way.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a different method than `fail`, and it would not handle errors in the same way.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `catch` is a different method than `fail`, and it would not handle errors in the same way.

DONE.
