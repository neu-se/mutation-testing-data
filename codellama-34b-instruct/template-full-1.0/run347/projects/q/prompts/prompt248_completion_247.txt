  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property may return a different value than the `indexOf` method, depending on the length of the stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.split('\n')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method would return a different value than the `indexOf` method if the stack trace contains newlines.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.substr(0, e.stack.indexOf('\n'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method would return a different value than the `indexOf` method if the stack trace contains newlines.

DONE.
