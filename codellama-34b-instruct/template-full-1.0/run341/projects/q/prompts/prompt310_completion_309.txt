  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

This would result in different behavior because a new function is added to the `Q.race` method that takes no arguments and returns `undefined`, which would cause the `race` method to always return `undefined`, regardless of the values of the promises passed to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve, reject, function () { throw "error!"; }
```
This would result in different behavior because a new function is added to the `Q.race` method that takes no arguments and returns a promise that
