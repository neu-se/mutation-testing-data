Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => accum
```
This would result in different behavior because it ignores the current operation (`curr`) and always returns the initial value, effectively making the `reduce` function return the initial value regardless of the operations in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(accum, curr, index) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly adds 1 to the accumulated value for each operation, which would lead to an incorrect total that does not reflect the actual operations being reduced.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
accum - curr.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it subtracts the `insert` value of the current operation from the accumulated value, which could lead to a negative length if there are more insert operations than the initial value, thus misrepresenting the intended behavior of the `reduce` function.

DONE.
