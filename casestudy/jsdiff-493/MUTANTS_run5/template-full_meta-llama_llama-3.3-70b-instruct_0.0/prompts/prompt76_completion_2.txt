Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
obj.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `obj.toString()` returns a string representation of the object, whereas the original code uses `obj` directly, which is an object. This change would cause the `hasOwnProperty` method to be called on a string, leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
window
```
This would result in different behavior because `window` refers to the global object in a browser environment, whereas the original code uses `obj`, which is the object being processed. This change would cause the `hasOwnProperty` method to be called on the global object, leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that does not have any properties, whereas the original code uses `obj`, which is an object. This change would cause the `hasOwnProperty` method to throw a TypeError, because `null` does not have this method.

DONE.
