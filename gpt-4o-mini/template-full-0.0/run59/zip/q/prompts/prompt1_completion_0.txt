Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof bootstrap === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `bootstrap` is an object instead of a function, which would likely lead to the code block not executing when `bootstrap` is indeed a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof bootstrap !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the original condition, causing the code block to execute when `bootstrap` is not a function, which is the opposite of the intended logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bootstrap === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `bootstrap` is undefined, which would bypass the code block entirely if `bootstrap` is defined as a function, leading to potential errors in the execution flow.

DONE.
