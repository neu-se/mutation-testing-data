  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[1], strings[0], cursor
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the strings is reversed, which could cause the diff algorithm to produce a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0].split(''), strings[1].split(''), cursor
```
This would result in different behavior because the strings are split into arrays of individual characters, which could cause the diff algorithm to produce a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0].toLowerCase(), strings[1].toLowerCase(), cursor
```
This would result in different behavior because the strings are converted to lowercase, which could cause the diff algorithm to produce a different output.

DONE.
