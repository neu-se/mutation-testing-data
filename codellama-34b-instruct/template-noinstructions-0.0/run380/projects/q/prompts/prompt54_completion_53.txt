  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.toString.bind(process)
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.toString` is a function, and `process.toString.bind(process)` is a bound function that always returns the same value, regardless of the context in which it is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.toString.call(process)
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.toString.call(process)` is a function that always returns the same value, regardless of the context in which it is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.toString.apply(process)
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.toString.apply(process)` is a function that always returns the same value, regardless of the context in which it is called.

DONE.
