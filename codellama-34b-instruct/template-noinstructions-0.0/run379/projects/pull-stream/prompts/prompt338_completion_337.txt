  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `field.toString()` would return a string representation of the `field` function, whereas `field` by itself would return the function itself. This could potentially cause issues in the `filter` function, which expects a function as its argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `field.bind(this)` would create a new function that is bound to the current context, whereas `field` by itself would not be bound to any specific context. This could potentially cause issues in the `filter` function, which expects a function that is not bound to any specific context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `field.call(this)` would call the `field` function with the current context as its `this` value, whereas `field` by itself would not be called with
