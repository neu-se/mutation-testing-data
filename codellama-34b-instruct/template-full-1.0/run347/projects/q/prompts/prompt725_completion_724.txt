  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.test` method is not part of the `promise.inspect` object, so it will return `undefined` instead of a promise state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.resolve` is a function that resolves the promise with the given value, while `promise.inspect` returns the promise state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.reject` is a function that rejects the promise with the given reason, while `promise.inspect` returns the promise state.

DONE.
