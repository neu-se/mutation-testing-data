  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(false, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `read` function to be called with `false` instead of `true`, which would result in the `nextStream` function being called instead of the `nextChunk` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(null, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `read` function to be called with `null` instead of `true`, which would result in the `nextStream` function being called instead of the `nextChunk` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(undefined, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `read` function to be called with `undefined` instead of `true`, which would result in the `nextStream` function being called instead of the `nextChunk` function.

DONE.
