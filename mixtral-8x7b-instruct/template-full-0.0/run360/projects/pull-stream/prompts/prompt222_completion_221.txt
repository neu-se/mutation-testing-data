 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[data, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the order of the arguments passed to the callback function, which could cause issues if the code downstream expects the arguments in a specific order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the second argument from the original data to the length of the data, which could cause issues if the code downstream expects a specific data type or value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return data }
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the second argument from the original data to a function that returns the data, which could cause issues if the code downstream expects a specific data type or value.

DONE.
