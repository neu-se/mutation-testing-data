  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with the `end` and `data` arguments, whereas the original code fragment only called `cb` with the `end` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with the `end` and `data + 1` arguments, whereas the original code fragment only called `cb` with the `end` and `data` arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with the `end` and `data * 2` arguments, whereas the original code fragment only called `cb` with the `end` and `data` arguments.

DONE.
