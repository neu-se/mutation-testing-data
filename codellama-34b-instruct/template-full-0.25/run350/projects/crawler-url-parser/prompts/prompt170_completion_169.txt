  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.domain != pageurl.domain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return "external" for links that have the same domain as the page, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.domain.length != pageurl.domain.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return "external" for links that have a different domain length than the page, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.domain.length < pageurl.domain.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return "external" for links that have a shorter domain length than the page, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
