  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"send"
```
This would result in different behavior because "send" is a different operator than "throw" and would not propagate the error to the errback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"reject"
```
This would result in different behavior because "reject" is a different operator than "throw" and would not propagate the error to the errback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"resolve"
```
This would result in different behavior because "resolve" is a different operator than "throw" and would not propagate the error to the errback.

DONE.
