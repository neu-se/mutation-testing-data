  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` expects the context as the first argument, whereas `apply` expects an array of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with the context and arguments bound, whereas `apply` calls the function with the provided context and arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(this, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` calls the function with the provided context and arguments, whereas `bind` creates a new function with the context and arguments bound.

DONE.
