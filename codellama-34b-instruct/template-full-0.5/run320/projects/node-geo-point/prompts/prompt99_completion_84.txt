  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x, y
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the coordinates is reversed, which could cause issues when attempting to display the point on a map or other visual representation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y, x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the x-coordinate is offset by 1, which could cause the point to be displayed in the wrong location on a map or other visual representation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1, y
```
This would result in different behavior because the y-coordinate is offset by 1, which could cause the point to be displayed in the wrong location on a map or other visual representation.

DONE.
