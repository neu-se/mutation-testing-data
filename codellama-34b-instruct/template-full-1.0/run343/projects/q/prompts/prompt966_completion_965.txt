  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a valid syntax for returning undefined in JavaScript, while `null` is a valid value. If the replaced code ran a check for undefined, it would evaluate to false on `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a valid syntax for returning undefined in JavaScript, while `undefined` is a value. If the replaced code ran a check for undefined, it would evaluate to false on `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q` is a function in the Q library, while `void 0` is not a valid reference in the Q library. If the replaced code relied on the nonexistent `Q` function, it would result in an error.

DONE.
