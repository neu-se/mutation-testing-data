Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the error to the callback, indicating an error occurred, rather than simply calling the callback without any arguments, which would imply success.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, 'error')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the callback with a string 'error' as the second argument, which could lead to confusion in the consuming code, as it would not be a valid data response but rather a misleading indication of an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the callback with a boolean value `true`, which may not be handled correctly by the consuming code, as it expects either an error or data, not a boolean.

DONE.
