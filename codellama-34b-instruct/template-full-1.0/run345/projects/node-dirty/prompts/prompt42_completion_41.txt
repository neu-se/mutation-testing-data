  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `val` variable with the `key` variable, which could cause errors in the code that uses the `val` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `val` variable with an array containing the `key` variable, which could cause errors in the code that uses the `val` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `val` variable with a `null` value, which could cause errors in the code that uses the `val` variable.

DONE.
