  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sources[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `sources` is an object, and `sources[0]` would refer to the first property of that object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sources.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `sources` is an object, and `sources.length` would return the number of properties in that object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sources.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because `sources` is an object, and `sources.keys()` would return an array of the keys (property names) in that object.

DONE.
