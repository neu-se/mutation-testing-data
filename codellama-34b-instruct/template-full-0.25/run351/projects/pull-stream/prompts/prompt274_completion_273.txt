  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(stream)
```
This would result in different behavior because `once` is a function that returns a new stream that only allows one read operation, whereas the original code fragment `once` is a function that returns a new stream that allows multiple read operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.pipe(once)
```
This would result in different behavior because `stream.pipe` is a method that pipes the data from the current stream to the `once` stream, whereas the original code fragment `once` is a function that returns a new stream that allows multiple read operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once.pipe(stream)
```
This would result in different behavior because `once.pipe` is a method that pipes the data from the `once` stream to the current stream, whereas the original code fragment `once` is a function that returns a new stream that allows multiple read operations.

DONE.
