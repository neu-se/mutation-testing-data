  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfill(value + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the fulfillment value would be different from the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected instead of fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfill(value * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the fulfillment value would be different from the original code.

DONE.
