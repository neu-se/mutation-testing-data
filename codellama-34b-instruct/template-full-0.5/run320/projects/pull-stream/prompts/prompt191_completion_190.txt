  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.foo
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.foo` is not a function, and would throw an error when called with the `map` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.bar
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.bar` is not a function, and would return `undefined` when called with the `map` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.baz
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.baz` is not a function, and would return `undefined` when called with the `map` argument.

DONE.
