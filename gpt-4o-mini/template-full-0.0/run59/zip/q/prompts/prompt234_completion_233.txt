Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch.apply(null, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the context of `this` from `resolvedPromise` to `null`, which may lead to unexpected results if `promiseDispatch` relies on the context of the `resolvedPromise` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.valueOf.apply(resolvedPromise, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the `valueOf` method of `resolvedPromise` instead of `promiseDispatch`, which may not handle the arguments in the same way and could lead to incorrect promise resolution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.inspect.apply(resolvedPromise, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because it invokes the `inspect` method instead of `promiseDispatch`, which does not fulfill the intended operation of dispatching the promise and may result in the promise not being resolved or rejected as expected.

DONE.
