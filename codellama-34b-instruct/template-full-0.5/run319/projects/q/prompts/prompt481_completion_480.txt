  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `at` would refer to the previous element in the array, rather than the current element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `at` would refer to the next element in the array, rather than the current element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `at.length` would refer to the length of the array, rather than the current element.

DONE.
