 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.asin(point1Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `asin` function instead of `deg2rad`, which converts radians to degrees, causing incorrect calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan2(point1Rad, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `atan2` function with incorrect arguments, causing unexpected output and incorrect calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `deg2rad` function with a constant value of 0, causing all calculations involving latitude and longitude to be incorrect.

DONE.
