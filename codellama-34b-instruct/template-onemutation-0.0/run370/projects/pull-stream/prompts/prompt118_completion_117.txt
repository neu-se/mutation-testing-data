  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `end` is truthy, while the new code fragment checks if `end` is strictly equal to `true`. This change would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `end` is a truthy value other than `true`, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the program.

DONE.
