 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` is expected to be a function, and replacing it with `null` would cause an error when called in `this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).fail(deferred.reject);`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` is expected to be a function, and replacing it with an empty object would cause an error when called in `this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).fail(deferred.reject);`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` returns a function that is used to resolve the deferred object with a Node.js-style callback. Replacing it with `deferred.resolve` would cause the promise to be resolved
