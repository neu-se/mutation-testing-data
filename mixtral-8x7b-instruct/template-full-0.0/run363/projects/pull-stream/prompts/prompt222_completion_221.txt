 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, data
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always pass the data as the second argument to the callback, even when an error occurs. The original code fragment passes `null` as the second argument when there's an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, data
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `undefined` instead of `null` as the first argument when there's no error. This could cause issues if the callback expects `null` to mean "no error" and `undefined` to mean something else.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would swap the order of the arguments in the callback. This could cause issues if the callback expects the error to be the first argument and the data to be the second.

DONE.
