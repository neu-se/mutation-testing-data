  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with the `this` context bound to the first argument, which would change the behavior of `then` when it is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` calls the function with the `this` context set to the first argument, which would change the behavior of `then` when it is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.apply(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` calls the function with the `this` context set to the first argument and the arguments passed as an array, which would change the behavior of `then` when it is called.

DONE.
