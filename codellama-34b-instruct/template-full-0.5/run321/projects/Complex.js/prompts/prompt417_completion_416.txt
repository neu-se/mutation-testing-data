  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite` checks if the complex number is infinite, whereas `isZero` checks if the complex number is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `isZero` checks if the complex number is zero, whereas `re` checks if the real part of the complex number is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `isZero` checks if the complex number is zero, whereas `im` checks if the imaginary part of the complex number is zero.

DONE.
