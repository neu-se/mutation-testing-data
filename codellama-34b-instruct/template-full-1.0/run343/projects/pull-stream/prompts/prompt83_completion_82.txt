  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort = abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create an infinite loop, as `abort` is always assigned to itself, and the `while` loop would never exit.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort = true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `while` loop to exit immediately, as `abort` would be set to `true`, and the loop condition would evaluate to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read = abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `while` loop to exit immediately, as `read` would be set to `abort`, and the loop condition would evaluate to `false`.

DONE.
