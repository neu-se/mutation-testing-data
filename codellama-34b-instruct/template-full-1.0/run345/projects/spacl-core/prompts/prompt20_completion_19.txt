  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `startsWith` checks if the string starts with the given substring, while `endsWith` checks if the string ends with the given substring.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.indexOf('/') !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` returns the index of the first occurrence of the given substring, and `!== -1` checks if the index is not equal to -1, which indicates that the substring was not found.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.match(/^\//) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` checks if the string matches the given regular expression, and `=== null` checks if the result is null, which indicates that the string does not match the expression.

DONE.
