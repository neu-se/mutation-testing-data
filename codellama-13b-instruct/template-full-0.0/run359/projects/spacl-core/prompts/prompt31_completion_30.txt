  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\$'
```
This would result in different behavior because the backslash would be escaped, causing the dollar sign to be treated as a literal character instead of an anchor.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\\\$'
```
This would result in different behavior because the backslash would be escaped twice, causing the dollar sign to be treated as a literal character and the backslash to be treated as an escape character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\\\\\$'
```
This would result in different behavior because the backslash would be escaped three times, causing the dollar sign to be treated as a literal character and the backslash to be treated as an escape character twice.

DONE.
