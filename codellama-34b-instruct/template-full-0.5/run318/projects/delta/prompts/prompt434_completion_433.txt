  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the attributes of the next operation, rather than the operation itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the next operation in the list, rather than the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the previous operation in the list, rather than the current operation.

DONE.
