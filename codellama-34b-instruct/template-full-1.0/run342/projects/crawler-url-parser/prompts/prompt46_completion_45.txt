  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returned a formatted URL, while this modified code returns `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returned a formatted URL, while this modified code returns `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return '';
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returned a formatted URL, while this modified code returns an empty string.

DONE.
