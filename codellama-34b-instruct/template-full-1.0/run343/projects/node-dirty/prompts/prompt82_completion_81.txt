  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.lastIndexOf('\n') !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator is negating the result of the `lastIndexOf` method, causing the statement to always evaluate to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.lastIndexOf('\n') < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<` operator is checking if the result of the `lastIndexOf` method is less than 0, which would never be the case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.length - chunk.lastIndexOf('\n') < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of the `chunk` object is being subtracted from the result of the `lastIndexOf` method, which would always result in a negative number.

DONE.
