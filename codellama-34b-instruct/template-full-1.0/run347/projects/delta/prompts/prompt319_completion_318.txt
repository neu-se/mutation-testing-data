  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `inverted.delete` would delete the characters in the `otherOp` instead of retaining them with attributes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retain(
  transformedData,
  AttributeMap.transform(
    thisOp.attributes,
    otherOp.attributes,
    !priority,
  ),
)
```
This would result in different behavior because `!priority` would invert the priority flag, which would cause the attributes to be transformed in the opposite way.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retain(
  transformedData,
  AttributeMap.transform(
    thisOp.attributes,
    otherOp.attributes,
    otherOp.attributes,
  ),
)
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.attributes` is being used as the priority flag, which would cause the attributes to be transformed in the opposite way
