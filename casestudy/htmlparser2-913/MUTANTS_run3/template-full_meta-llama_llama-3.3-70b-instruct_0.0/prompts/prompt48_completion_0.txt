Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.updatePosition(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `updatePosition` method is called with a different offset, which could affect the indices used in the parser.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.startIndex = this.tokenizer.getAbsoluteSectionStart() + 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because only the `startIndex` is updated, without considering the `tokenizer` object's current state, potentially leading to incorrect indexing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.endIndex = this.tokenizer.getAbsoluteIndex() + 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because only the `endIndex` is updated, without considering the `startIndex` or the `tokenizer` object's current state, potentially causing inconsistencies in the parser's internal state.

DONE.
