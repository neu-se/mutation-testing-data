  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper
```
This would result in different behavior because the `mapper` function is not being called, and the `!` operator is not being used to negate the result of the function call.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!mapper()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `mapper` function is being called, but the result of the function call is not being negated with the `!` operator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `mapper` function is being called, but the result of the function call is not being used to determine the value of the `data` variable.

DONE.
