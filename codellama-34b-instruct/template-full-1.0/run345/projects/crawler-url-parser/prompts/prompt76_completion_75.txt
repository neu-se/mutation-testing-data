  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(embedBaseUrlStr, baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` passed to the `parse` function would be the `baseUrlStr` from the `baseUrl` object, instead of the `baseUrl` object itself. This could lead to different parsing results and a different `baseUrl` object being created.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(embedBaseUrlStr, parsedBaseUrl).url
```
This would result in different behavior because the `url` property of the `parsedBaseUrl` object would be passed to the `parse` function, instead of the `parsedBaseUrl` object itself. This could lead to different parsing results and a different `baseUrl` object being created.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(embedBaseUrlStr, parse(baseUrlStr)).url
```
This would result in different behavior because the `url` property of the `parsedUrl` object
