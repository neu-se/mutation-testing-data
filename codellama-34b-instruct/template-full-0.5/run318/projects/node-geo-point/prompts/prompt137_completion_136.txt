  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
adjust(this.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would adjust the latitude instead of the longitude, which could cause the resulting GeoPoint to have a different position.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
adjust(this.longitude + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would adjust the longitude by adding 1 instead of adjusting it to the specified precision, which could cause the resulting GeoPoint to have a different position.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
adjust(this.longitude + Math.PI)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would adjust the longitude by adding pi instead of adjusting it to the specified precision, which could cause the resulting GeoPoint to have a different position.

DONE.
