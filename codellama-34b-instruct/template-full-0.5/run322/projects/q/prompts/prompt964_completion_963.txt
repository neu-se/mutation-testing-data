  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an object and does not have a `nbind` method, unlike `this` which refers to the current object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty object `{}` does not have a `nbind` method, unlike `this` which refers to the current object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q` is a function and does not have a `nbind` method, unlike `this` which refers to the current object.

DONE.
