  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + c + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 would result in a different value for the imaginary part of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the use of the variable b instead of c would result in a different value for the real part of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + toString(c)
```
This would result in different behavior because the use of the toString function instead of directly concatenating the strings would result in a different value for the imaginary part of the complex number.

DONE.
