  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w == 'dwarf'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'dwarf' is a string, and == only checks for equality, not identity.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w === 5
```
This would result in different behavior because 5 is a number, and === also checks for strict equality, i.e. same type and value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.toLowerCase() === 'roof'
```
This would result in different behavior because toLowerCase() would not have been called on the original code fragment.

DONE.
