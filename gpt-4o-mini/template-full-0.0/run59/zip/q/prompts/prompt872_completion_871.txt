Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(null, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the handling of fulfilled and rejected states, effectively ignoring both and not propagating any errors or values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).catch(rejected);
```
This would result in different behavior because it alters the promise chain to only handle rejections, potentially leading to unhandled fulfillment cases if the promise resolves successfully.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(fulfilled);
```
This would result in different behavior because it omits the rejection handler, which means that any errors occurring in the promise will not be caught, leading to unhandled promise rejections.

DONE.
