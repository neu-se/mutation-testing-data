 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isRejected` function would always return false, regardless of the input's promise state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isRejected` function would return true when the input is `null`, even if it's not a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isRejected` function would always return the value of the `this` keyword, which may not be related to the input's promise state.

DONE.
