 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign calculation will not be applied to the imaginary part when the input is a string representation of a complex number with an imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(minus % 2 ? '+' : '-') + '1'
