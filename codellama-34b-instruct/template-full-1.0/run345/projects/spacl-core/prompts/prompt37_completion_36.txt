  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    const reversed = spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method is being called on the wrong object. The `spec` variable is a string, but `reverse()` is a method of the Array prototype, so calling it on a string would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    const reversed = spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method is being called on the wrong object. The `spec` variable is a string, but `slice()` is a method of the Array prototype, so calling it on a string would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    const reversed = spec.split('/').reverse().slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the methods is reversed.
