  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(b) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the exponential of `b` and subtract 1, instead of calculating the exponential of `a + i*b` and subtracting 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the exponential of 1 and subtract 1, which would result in 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b / a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would perform the division of `b` by `a` instead of calculating the exponential of `a` minus 1.

DONE.
