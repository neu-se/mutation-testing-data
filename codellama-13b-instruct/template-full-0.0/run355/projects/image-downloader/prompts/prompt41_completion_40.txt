  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(new Error('Request Failed.\n' +
                         `Status Code: ${res.statusCode}`));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment rejects the promise with an error message, while the new code fragment rejects the promise with a new error object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(new Error('Request Failed.\n' +
                         `Status Code: ${res.statusCode}`));
```
