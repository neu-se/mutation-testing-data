  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deliverTimezones.bind(null, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method creates a new function with a specific context and arguments, but in this case, the context is `null` and the argument is `options`, which is not what the original code intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deliverTimezones.call(null, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method calls a function with a specific context and arguments, but in this case, the context is `null` and the argument is `options`, which is not what the original code intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deliverTimezones.apply(null, [options])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method calls a function with a specific context and arguments, but in this case, the context is `null` and the argument is an array containing `options`, which is not
