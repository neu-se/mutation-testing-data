 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be immediately invoked without any arguments, instead of passing `null` as the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb.bind(null, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always pass `true` as the first argument to the callback, even if the `abort` variable is `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value && cb
