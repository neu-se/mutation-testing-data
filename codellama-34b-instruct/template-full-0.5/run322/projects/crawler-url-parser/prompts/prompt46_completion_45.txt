  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.parse` returns an object containing the individual components of the URL, whereas `URL.format` returns a formatted string representation of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.resolve` resolves a relative URL to an absolute URL, whereas `URL.format` returns a formatted string representation of the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.pathToFileURL
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.pathToFileURL` converts a file path to a file URL, whereas `URL.format` returns a formatted string representation of the URL.

DONE.
