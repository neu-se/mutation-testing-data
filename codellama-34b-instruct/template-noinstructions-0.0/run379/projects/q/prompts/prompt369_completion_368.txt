  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.message
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function expects an `Error` object as its argument, but `exception.message` is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function expects an `Error` object as its argument, but `new Error(exception)` creates a new `Error` object with `exception` as its message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function expects an `Error` object as its argument, but `null` is not an `Error` object.

DONE.
