Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_indexOf(unhandledRejections, promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the index of the promise in the `unhandledRejections` array instead of the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, potentially leading to incorrect handling of reported rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.length, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses the length of the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array instead of the actual array, which would not provide the correct index for the promise, leading to failure in emitting the `rejectionHandled` event.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons[0], promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it always refers to the first element of the `unhandledReasons` array instead of the corresponding reason for the specific promise, which could lead to incorrect information being emitted when handling rejections.

DONE.
