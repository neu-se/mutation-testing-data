 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.assign({}, psl.parse)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of the `psl.parse` object, which may not behave exactly the same way as the original object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
psl.parse.bind(psl)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a bound function that always has `psl` as its `this` value, which may not be the same as the original function's `this` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(...args) => psl.parse(...args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new arrow function that wraps the `psl.parse` function, which may have different behavior due to differences in scoping and `this` binding.

DONE.
