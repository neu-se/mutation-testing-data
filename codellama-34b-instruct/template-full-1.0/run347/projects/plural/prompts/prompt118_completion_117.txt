  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(/\bics$/i, "is")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a RegExp to match words that end in "ics", but this replacement would match words that end in "is" instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(/\bics$/i, "ics")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment appends an "s" to the word, but this replacement would maintain the original word without any changes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(/\bics$/i, "ys")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a RegExp to match words that end in "ics", but this replacement would match words that end in "ys" instead.

DONE.
