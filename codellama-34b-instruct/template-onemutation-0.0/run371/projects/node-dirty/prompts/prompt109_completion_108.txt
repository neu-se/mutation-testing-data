  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer}`));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment emits an error event with a specific message, while the buggy code fragment emits an error event with a different message.

DONE.
