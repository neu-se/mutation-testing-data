  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set(currentUrl.url, currentUrl);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `urlMap` to contain a duplicate entry for the `currentUrl.url` key, which would lead to unexpected results when trying to retrieve the value associated with that key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set(currentUrl.url, currentUrl.url);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `urlMap` to contain a key-value pair where the key is the `currentUrl.url` and the value is the `currentUrl.url` itself, which would lead to unexpected results when trying to retrieve the value associated with that key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set(currentUrl.url, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `urlMap` to contain a key-value pair where the key is the `currentUrl.url
