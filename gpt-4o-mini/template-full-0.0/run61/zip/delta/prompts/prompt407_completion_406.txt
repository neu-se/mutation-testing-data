Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because setting `handler` to `null` would cause a runtime error when attempting to call `handler.transform`, as `null` is not a valid object and does not have a `transform` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler = Delta.getHandler('nonExistentType');
```
This would result in different behavior because attempting to get a handler for a non-existent type would likely return `undefined`, leading to a runtime error when trying to call `undefined.transform`, as `undefined` does not have a `transform` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler = Delta.getHandler(embedType + 'Invalid');
```
This would result in different behavior because appending 'Invalid' to `embedType` would likely result in a handler that does not exist, causing the same issue as above where `handler` would be `undefined`, leading to a runtime error when calling `handler.transform`.

DONE.
