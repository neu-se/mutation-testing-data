  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(() => this._writeStream.destroy());
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` method is called on the write stream, which would cause it to stop accepting new data and wait for the buffer to be flushed before destroying the stream. In the original code, the `end` method is not called, so the write stream would continue to accept new data and the `destroy` method would be called immediately after the buffer is flushed.

DONE.
