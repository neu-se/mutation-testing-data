Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Parsing error");
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of exiting the parser silently, it throws an error, which could be caught and handled by the calling code, potentially allowing the program to continue running.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return { 're': 0, 'im': 0 };
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of exiting the parser, it returns a complex number with both real and imaginary parts set to zero, which may lead to incorrect calculations later in the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("Invalid input");
```
This would result in different behavior because it logs a message to the console instead of terminating the parsing process, allowing the program to continue executing with potentially invalid data.

DONE.
