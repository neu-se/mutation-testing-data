  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the decrement operator `--` is used instead of the increment operator `++`, which would cause the counter to count down instead of up.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `i + 1` is used instead of `i++`, which would cause the counter to count up by 1 instead of 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i * 2, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `i * 2` is used instead of `i++`, which would cause the counter to count up by 2 instead of 1.

DONE.
