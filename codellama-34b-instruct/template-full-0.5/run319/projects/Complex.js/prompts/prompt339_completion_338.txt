  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 || b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the function to return a result even if only one of the coordinates is zero, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 && b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the function to return a result only if the first coordinate is zero and the second is not, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0 && b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the function to return a result only if both coordinates are non-zero, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
