  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y * x
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator has a higher precedence than the `+` operator, so the expression `y + x` would be evaluated as `(y + x) * x`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y + x
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `y + x` would be evaluated as `y + (x * x)`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y - x
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `y - x` would be evaluated as `y - (x * x)`, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
