  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `opLength` variable is used to determine the length of the operation, and adding 1 to it would cause the operation to have an incorrect length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `opLength` variable is used to determine the length of the operation, and subtracting 1 from it would cause the operation to have an incorrect length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `opLength` variable is used to determine the length of the operation, and setting it to 0 would cause the operation to have a length of 0, which would likely cause the code to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
