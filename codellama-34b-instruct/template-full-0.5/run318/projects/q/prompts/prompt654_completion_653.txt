  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` would return a rejected promise, causing the `dispatch` method to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` would return a resolved promise, causing the `dispatch` method to succeed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when` would return a promise that is resolved with the value of the input promise, but the `dispatch` method expects a function as its first argument.

DONE.
