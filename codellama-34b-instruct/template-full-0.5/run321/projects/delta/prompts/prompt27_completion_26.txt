  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(attrs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys()` returns an array of keys from the `attrs` object, while `attributes` is a variable that contains the attribute map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(attrs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values()` returns an array of values from the `attrs` object, while `attributes` is a variable that contains the attribute map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries(attrs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries()` returns an array of key-value pairs from the `attrs` object, while `attributes` is a variable that contains the attribute map.

DONE.
