  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(θ + 360) % 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `rad2deg` function to convert the angle from radians to degrees, but the new code fragment uses a modulo operation to wrap the angle around to the range of 0 to 360 degrees. This could cause the bearing calculation to produce different results, especially if the input angles are close to the 360 degree mark.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(θ + 180) % 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `rad2deg` function to convert the angle from radians to degrees, but the new code fragment uses a modulo operation to wrap the angle around to the range of 0 to 180 degrees. This could cause the bearing calculation to produce different results, especially if the input angles are close to the 180 degree mark.

Option 3: The PLACEHOL
