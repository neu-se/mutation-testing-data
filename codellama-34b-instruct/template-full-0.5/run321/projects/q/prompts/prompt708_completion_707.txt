  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would omit the first argument of the `fbound` function, which is used to determine the `this` value of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would omit the first two arguments of the `fbound` function, which are used to determine the `this` value and the first argument of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would omit the first argument of the `fbound` function, but keep the second argument, which is used to determine the `this` value of the function.

DONE.
