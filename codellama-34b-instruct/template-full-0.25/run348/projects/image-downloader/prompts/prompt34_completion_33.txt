  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.resume(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `res.resume();`, which would consume the response data and free up memory, while the new code fragment would not consume the response data and would therefore keep the memory occupied.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.resume(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `res.resume();`, which would consume the response data and free up memory, while the new code fragment would not consume the response data and would therefore keep the memory occupied.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.resume(res.data);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `res.resume();`, which would consume the response data and free up memory, while the new code fragment would consume the response data and keep the memory occupied.

DONE.
