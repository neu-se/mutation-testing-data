  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peek` would return the next element in the iteration, whereas `otherIter.peek()` would return the next element and advance the iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peek` would return the type of the next element, whereas `otherIter.peekType()` would return the type of the current element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peek` would return the length of the next element, whereas `otherIter.peekLength()` would return the length of the current element.

DONE.
