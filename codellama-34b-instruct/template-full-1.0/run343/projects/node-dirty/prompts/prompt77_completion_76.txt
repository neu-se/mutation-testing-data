  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error('Failed to load'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits a 'load' event with the number of loaded keys, while the new code emits an 'error' event with a message indicating that the load operation failed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', this._data.size + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits a 'load' event with the number of loaded keys, while the new code emits a 'load' event with a different number (1 more than the original number of loaded keys).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not handle the 'drain' event, while the new code does.

DONE.
