  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the latitude instead of the longitude, which could cause errors in the calculation of the destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-this.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the negative longitude, which would result in a different destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the longitude plus one, which would result in a different destination point.

DONE.
