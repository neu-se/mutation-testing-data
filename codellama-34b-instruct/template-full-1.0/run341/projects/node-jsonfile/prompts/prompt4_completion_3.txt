  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'utf8'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `readFile` function expects an options object, not a string like `'utf8'`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `readFile` function expects options to be an object, and passing `undefined` would cause it to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `readFile` function expects options to be an object, and passing a number like `1` would cause it to throw an error.

DONE.
