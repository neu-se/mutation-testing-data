  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a GeoPoint object, but null is not a valid GeoPoint object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new GeoPoint(0, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a GeoPoint object with non-zero coordinates, but a GeoPoint object with coordinates (0, 0) is not a valid destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a GeoPoint object that is different from the current GeoPoint object, but using "this" would result in the same GeoPoint object being passed as an argument.

DONE.
