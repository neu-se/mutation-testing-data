  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, fulfilled, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the callbacks has been changed, which could affect the behavior of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progressed, function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra callback has been added to the list, which could cause the program to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progressed, null
```
This would result in different behavior because a null value has been added to the list of callbacks, which could cause the program to behave differently.

DONE.
