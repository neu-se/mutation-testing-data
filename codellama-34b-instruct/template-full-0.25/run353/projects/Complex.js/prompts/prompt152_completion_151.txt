  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` checks if the value is Not-a-Number, while `isInfinite` checks if the value is Infinity.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` checks if the value is a finite number, while `isInfinite` checks if the value is Infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation of `isInfinite` would return `true` for all values that are not Infinity, while the original code fragment would only return `true` for Infinity.

DONE.
