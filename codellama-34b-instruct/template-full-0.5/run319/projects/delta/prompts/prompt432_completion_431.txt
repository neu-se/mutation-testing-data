  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the next op in the array instead of the current op, which could cause the iterator to skip over operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the previous op in the array instead of the current op, which could cause the iterator to go back in time and repeat operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[Math.floor(Math.random() * this.ops.length)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a random op from the array instead of the current op, which could cause the iterator to jump around and perform operations in a different order.

DONE.
