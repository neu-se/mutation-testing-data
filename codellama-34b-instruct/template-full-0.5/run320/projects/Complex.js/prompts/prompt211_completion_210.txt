  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a, b
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments in the `atan2` function is reversed, which would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b, a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the `atan2` function is now `a + 1`, which would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1, b
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument of the `atan2` function is now `a + 1`, which would cause the function to return a different value.

DONE.
