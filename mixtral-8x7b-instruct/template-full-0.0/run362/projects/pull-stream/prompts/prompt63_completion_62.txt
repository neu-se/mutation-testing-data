 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = end && abort
```
This would result in different behavior because if `end` is falsy, it will always set `loop` to false, and the function will stop reading data from the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it will always set `end` to the value of `abort`, which could cause the function to stop reading data from the stream or to throw an error when `end` is not `null` or `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
loop = false
```
This would result in different behavior because it will set the `loop` variable to false, causing the function to exit the while loop and stop reading data from the stream.

DONE.
