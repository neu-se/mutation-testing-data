  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.pipe(output).on('error', reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `reject` function to be called if there is an error while piping the archive to the output stream, which would cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.pipe(output).on('finish', resolve);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `resolve` function to be called when the archive is finished piping to the output stream, which would cause the promise to be resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.pipe(output).on('end', resolve);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `resolve` function to be called when the archive is finished piping to the output stream, which would cause the promise to be resolved.

DONE.
