  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new GeoPoint(coordinate.latitude + distance, coordinate.longitude + bearing);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the distance and bearing values to the latitude and longitude values, respectively, instead of using them as inputs to the calculateDestination method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new GeoPoint(coordinate.latitude * distance, coordinate.longitude * bearing);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the latitude and longitude values by the distance and bearing values, respectively, instead of using them as inputs to the calculateDestination method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new GeoPoint(coordinate.latitude - distance, coordinate.longitude - bearing);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the distance and bearing values from the latitude and longitude values, respectively, instead of using them as inputs to the calculateDestination method.

DONE.
