Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { throw new Error("Promise was rejected"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of passing the rejection handler to the promise chain, it throws a new error immediately, which could lead to unhandled promise rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` as the rejection handler means that any rejection will not be handled, potentially leading to unhandled promise rejections and the promise being left in a rejected state without any recovery.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return "Handled"; }
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of handling the rejection, it returns a string, which would cause the promise to resolve with that string instead of propagating the rejection, altering the expected flow of error handling.

DONE.
