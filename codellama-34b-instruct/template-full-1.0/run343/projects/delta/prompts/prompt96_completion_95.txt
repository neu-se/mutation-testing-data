  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the previous line checks whether `index` is equal to `this.ops.length`, but `index - 1` would never be equal to `this.ops.length` if `index` is a valid index in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the previous line checks whether `index` is equal to `this.ops.length`, but `index + 1` would never be equal to `this.ops.length` if `index` is a valid index in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the previous line checks whether `index` is equal to `this.ops.length`, but `this.ops.length - 1` would never be equal to `this.ops.length` since the array is non-
