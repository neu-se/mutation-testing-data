  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` and `attributes` are different properties of the `Op` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` and `attributes` are different properties of the `Op` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` and `attributes` are different properties of the `Op` object.

DONE.
