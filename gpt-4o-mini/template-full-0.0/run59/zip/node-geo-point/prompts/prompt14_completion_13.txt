Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof point.coordinates === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly allow non-array objects (like objects with properties) to pass the check, leading to potential runtime errors when the code expects an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length === 3
```
This would result in different behavior because it would require the coordinates array to have exactly three elements instead of two, causing valid GeoJSON points to be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates instanceof Array
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if `point.coordinates` is an instance of `Array`, which may not work correctly in environments with different global contexts (like iframes), potentially allowing non-array types to pass the check.

DONE.
