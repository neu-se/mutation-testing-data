  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first element of the `unhandledReasons` array, potentially causing the `untrackRejection` function to not properly remove the rejection from the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the wrong element from the `unhandledReasons` array, potentially causing the `untrackRejection` function to not properly remove the rejection from the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the wrong element from the `unhandledReasons` array, potentially causing the `untrackRejection` function to not properly remove the rejection from the array.

DONE.
