  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options.dest` is a string, while the new code fragment `options.dest.split('/').pop()` is an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.replace(' ', '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options.dest` may contain spaces, while the new code fragment `options.dest.replace(' ', '')` removes all spaces.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options.dest` may contain uppercase letters, while the new code fragment `options.dest.toLowerCase()` converts all letters to lowercase.

DONE.
