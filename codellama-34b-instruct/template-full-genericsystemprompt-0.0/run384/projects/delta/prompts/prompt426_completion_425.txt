  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.delete === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.delete` is a number, while this code checks if it's a string. If `op.delete` is a string, the original code would return `op.delete`, while this code would return `1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.retain` is an object, while this code checks if it's a number. If `op.retain` is a number, the original code would return `1`, while this code would return `op.retain`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.insert === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.insert` is a string, while this code checks if it's an object. If `
