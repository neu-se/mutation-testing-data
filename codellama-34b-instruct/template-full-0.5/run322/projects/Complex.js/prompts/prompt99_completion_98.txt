  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseFloat(c)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `parseFloat((minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + tokens[i + 1])`, which uses the `minus` variable to determine the sign of the parsed float value. Replacing it with `parseFloat(c)` would cause the sign to always be positive, which would lead to incorrect results in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseInt(c)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `parseFloat((minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + tokens[i + 1])`, which uses the `minus` variable to determine the sign of the parsed float value. Replacing it with `parseInt(c)` would cause the sign to always be positive, which would lead to incorrect results in some cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number(c)
```
This would result in different behavior because the
