 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to pass an empty array as the second argument to the "post" method instead of the specified `key` and `value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes the `Promise` object's context (`this`) as the second argument to the "post" method instead of the specified `key` and `value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes a random number as the second argument to the "post" method instead of the specified `key` and `value`.

DONE.
