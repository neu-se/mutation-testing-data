  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/^(?:wo)?man$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'e') })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and the replacement function is different. The original code fragment uses a regular expression pattern that matches "man" or "woman" with an optional "w" at the beginning, and replaces the "a" with "e". The new code fragment uses a regular expression pattern that matches "man" or "woman" with an optional "w" at the beginning, and replaces the "a" with "e".
