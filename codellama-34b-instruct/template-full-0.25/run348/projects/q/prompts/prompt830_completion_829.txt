  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with a null value, which would likely cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with an undefined value, which would likely cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with a false value, which would likely cause the test to fail.

DONE.
