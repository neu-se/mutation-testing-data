 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof content === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the type of `content` instead of checking if `content` is a Buffer. This would cause the `toString('utf8')` method to not be called when `content` is a Buffer, leading to potential issues with encoding.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content instanceof ArrayBuffer
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `content` is an ArrayBuffer, which is not the same as checking if it is a Buffer. This would cause the `toString('utf8')` method to not be called when `content` is a Buffer, leading to potential issues with encoding.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.constructor.name === 'Buffer'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the constructor name of `content` instead of checking if `content` is a Buffer. This would cause the `toString('utf8')` method
