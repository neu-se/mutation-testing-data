 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.makeNodeResolver(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver(true)` will always return a resolved promise with the value `true`, instead of using the provided `thisp` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.makeNodeResolver(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver(function() {})` will use an empty function as the node resolver, which might not behave as expected in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)` will use `null` as the node resolver, which might not behave as expected in the original code.

DONE.
