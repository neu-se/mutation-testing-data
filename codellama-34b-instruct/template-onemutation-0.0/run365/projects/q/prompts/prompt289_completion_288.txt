  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver(deferred.resolve, deferred.reject, deferred.notify);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolver` function is not defined in the provided code snippet, and the code would throw a `ReferenceError` when attempting to call it.

DONE.
