  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(promise, noop, noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because `noop` is a function that does nothing, so the `onRejected` function would never be called, even if the promise is rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(promise, onFulfilled, onRejected)
```
This would result in different behavior because `onFulfilled` and `onRejected` are functions that are not defined in the code snippet provided, so the code would not compile.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(promise, onRejected, onFulfilled)
```
This would result in different behavior because `onRejected` and `onFulfilled` are functions that are not defined in the code snippet provided, so the code would not compile.

DONE.
