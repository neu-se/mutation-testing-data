  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!point.hasOwnProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator changes the condition from checking if `point` has the `hasOwnProperty` method to checking if it doesn't have that method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(point.hasOwnProperty)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is now acting on the entire condition, rather than just the `hasOwnProperty` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` method is now being called with the argument `null`, which would return `false` if the property exists and `true` if it doesn't.

DONE.
