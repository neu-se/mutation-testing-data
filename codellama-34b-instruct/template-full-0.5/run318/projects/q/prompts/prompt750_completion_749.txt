  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.isRejected()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.isRejected()` will always return `false` if the promise is pending, whereas `pendingCount === 0` will only be true if the pending count is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.isPending()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.isPending()` will always return `true` if the promise is pending, whereas `pendingCount === 0` will only be true if the pending count is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.isFulfilled()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.isFulfilled()` will always return `false` if the promise is pending, whereas `pendingCount === 0` will only be true if the pending count is zero.

DONE.
