  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the - 1 would cause the length to be decremented by one, which would cause the algorithm to miss the last character of the input string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the + 1 would cause the length to be incremented by one, which would cause the algorithm to include the next character of the input string, even if it was not part of the original string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the * 2 would cause the length to be doubled, which would cause the algorithm to include twice as many characters of the input string, even if they were not part of the original string.

DONE.
