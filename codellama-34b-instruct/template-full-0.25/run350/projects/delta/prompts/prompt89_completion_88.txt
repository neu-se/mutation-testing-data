  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.attributes !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `newOp.attributes` is an object, while the replaced code fragment checks if it is not an object. This would cause the code to behave differently when `newOp.attributes` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `newOp.attributes` is an object, while the replaced code fragment checks if it is undefined. This would cause the code to behave differently when `newOp.attributes` is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `newOp.attributes` is an object, while the replaced code fragment checks if it is null. This would cause the code to behave differently when `newOp.attributes` is null.
