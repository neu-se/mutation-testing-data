  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res === false
```
This change will cause the `query` method to return `true` instead of `false` when the `res` variable is `false`, which is the opposite of the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res !== true
```
This change will cause the `query` method to return `false` instead of `true` when the `res` variable is `true`, which is the opposite of the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

DONE.
