  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (var k in sources)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the keys of the `sources` object, instead of the `sources` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (var k in throughs)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the keys of the `throughs` object, instead of the `sources` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (var k in sinks)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the keys of the `sinks` object, instead of the `sources` object.

DONE.
