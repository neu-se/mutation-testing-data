 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `readFile` function would no longer wait for the file to be read before returning a promise, causing potential issues with asynchronous code execution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(file, obj, options) => fs.writeFileSync(file, obj, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `writeFile` function would use the synchronous version of `fs.writeFile`, which could block the event loop and cause performance issues.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(file, obj, options) => fs.appendFileSync(file, obj, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `writeFile` function would use the synchronous version of `fs.appendFile`, which would append the contents of `obj` to the file instead of overwriting it.

DONE.
