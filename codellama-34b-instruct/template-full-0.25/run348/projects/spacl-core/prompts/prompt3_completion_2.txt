  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regex pattern would cause the regex engine to perform a global search and replace, rather than just searching for the first match.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regex pattern would cause the regex engine to perform a case-insensitive search, rather than a case-sensitive search.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/m
```
This would result in different behavior because the `m` flag at the end of the regex pattern would cause the regex engine to perform a multi-line search,
