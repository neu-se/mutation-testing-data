  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve, reject, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument `1` would be passed to the `Q` function, which would cause it to return a rejected promise with the value `1` instead of a resolved promise with the value `x`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve, reject, "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument `"foo"` would be passed to the `Q` function, which would cause it to return a rejected promise with the value `"foo"` instead of a resolved promise with the value `x`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve, reject, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument `null` would be passed to the `Q` function, which would cause it to return a rejected promise with the value `null` instead of a resolved promise with the value `x`.

DONE.
