```
linkurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "/")

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, "/")
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and it would not match the same parts of the string.
