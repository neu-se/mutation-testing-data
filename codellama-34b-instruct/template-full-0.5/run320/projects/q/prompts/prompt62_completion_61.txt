  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `flush` function immediately, rather than scheduling it to be called later using `setImmediate`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would schedule the `flush` function to be called with a delay of 1 millisecond, rather than immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would schedule the `flush` function to be called with a delay of 0 milliseconds, rather than immediately.

DONE.
