 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `else if` condition would always be true, bypassing the `switch` statement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `else if` condition would always be true, bypassing the `switch` statement. Although this is semantically equivalent to the original condition, the mutation testing tool would not recognize it as such.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `else if` condition would only check for `null` values, not `undefined` values.

DONE.
