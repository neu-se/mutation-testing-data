  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { throw new Error("Buggy code"); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to reject with an error, whereas the original code would resolve the promise with the value of `promise`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return 42; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to resolve with the value `42`, whereas the original code would resolve the promise with the value of `promise`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to resolve with the value `undefined`, whereas the original code would resolve the promise with the value of `promise`.

DONE.
