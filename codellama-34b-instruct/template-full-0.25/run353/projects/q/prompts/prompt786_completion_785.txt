  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as the first argument to `rejected` instead of `undefined`, which could potentially change the behavior of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be passed as the first argument to `rejected` instead of `void 0`, which could potentially change the behavior of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as the second argument to `rejected` instead of `rejected`, which could potentially change the behavior of the function.

DONE.
