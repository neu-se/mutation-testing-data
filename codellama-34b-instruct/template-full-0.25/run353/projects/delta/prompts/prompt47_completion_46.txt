  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for strict equality with `a`, while the modified code fragment is checking for strict equality with `a + 1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for strict equality with `a`, while the modified code fragment is checking for strict equality with `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for strict equality with `a`, while the modified code fragment is checking for strict equality with `a - 1`.

DONE.
