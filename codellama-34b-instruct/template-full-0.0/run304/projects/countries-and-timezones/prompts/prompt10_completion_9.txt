  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `result` object does not have a property with the key `country`, while this new code fragment checks if the property exists but is `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `result` object does not have a property with the key `country`, while this new code fragment checks if the property exists and is not `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `result` object does not have a property with the key `country`, while this new code fragment checks if the property exists and is `null`.

DONE.
