Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to treat the operation as a delete instead of an insert, potentially leading to incorrect transformations when merging two Deltas.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly prioritize retaining operations over insert operations, which could lead to unexpected results when transforming Deltas that contain both types of operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'insert' + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to always evaluate the type as 'insert' plus one, which is not a valid operation type, leading to potential runtime errors or incorrect handling of the operations.

DONE.
