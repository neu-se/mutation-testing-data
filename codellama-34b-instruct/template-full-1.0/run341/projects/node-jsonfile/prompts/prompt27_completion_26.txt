  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content && options.reviver
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `content` is truthy before trying to access the `reviver` property of `options`. If `content` is falsy, it would return `undefined` instead of throwing an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content || options.reviver
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `content` is falsy before trying to access the `reviver` property of `options`. If `content` is truthy, it would return `content` instead of `options.reviver`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const reviver = options.reviver;
return JSON.parse(content, reviver);
```
This would result in different behavior because it assigns a variable `reviver` to the value of `options.reviver` and then uses that variable in the `
