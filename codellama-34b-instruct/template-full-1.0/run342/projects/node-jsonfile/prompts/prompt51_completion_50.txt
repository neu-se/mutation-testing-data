  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(obj, replacer, spaces) + "foobar"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the string "foobar" to the end of the JSON string, which is not expected by the test cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(obj, null, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a different indent size (2) than the default (4), which could change the resulting JSON string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(obj, null, "    ")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a different indent string (4 spaces) than the default (2), which could change the resulting JSON string.

DONE.
