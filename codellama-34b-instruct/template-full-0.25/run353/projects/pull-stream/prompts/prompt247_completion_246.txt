  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err && abort, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(err && abort), cb`, which would only call `cb` if both `err` and `abort` are truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err || !abort, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator has a higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `err || (!abort), cb`, which would only call `cb` if `err` is truthy or `abort` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err ? abort : cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `?` operator has a higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `err ? abort : cb`, which would call `
