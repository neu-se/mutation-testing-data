  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` expects the context object as the first argument, whereas `apply` expects an array of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a bound context, whereas `apply` and `call` invoke the function with the specified context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(null, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` with a null context object would not have the same behavior as `apply` with the `this` context.

DONE.
