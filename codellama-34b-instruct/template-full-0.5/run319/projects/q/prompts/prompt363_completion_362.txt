  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would return a rejected promise with the reason from the original promise, instead of a resolved promise with the fulfillment value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would return a promise that is resolved with the progress value from the original promise, instead of a resolved promise with the fulfillment value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { throw new Error("foo"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would return a rejected promise with the error thrown from the function, instead of a resolved promise with the fulfillment value.

DONE.
