  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.verbs.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` creates a shallow copy of the `verbs` object, while the original code fragment references the original object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.verbs.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `length` returns the number of elements in the `verbs` object, while the original code fragment references the object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.verbs.hasOwnProperty('verb')
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasOwnProperty()` checks if the `verb` property exists in the `verbs` object, while the original code fragment references the object itself.

DONE.
