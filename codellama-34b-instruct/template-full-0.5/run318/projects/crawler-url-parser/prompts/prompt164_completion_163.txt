  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `startsWith` checks if the string starts with the given substring, while `includes` checks if the string contains the substring anywhere.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` returns the position of the first occurrence of the substring, while `includes` returns a boolean indicating whether the substring is present in the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` returns the position of the first occurrence of the substring, while `includes` returns a boolean indicating whether the substring is present in the string.

DONE.
