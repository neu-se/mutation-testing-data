  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude `a` values that are equal to zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if `b` is greater than zero, without considering `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(a - b) >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the difference between `a` and `b` is greater than or equal to zero, which is not equivalent to the original code.

DONE.
