  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable `a` is not the same as the variable `b` in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the expression `b + 1` is not the same as the value of the variable `b` in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the expression `b * 2` is not the same as the value of the variable `b` in the original code fragment.

DONE.
