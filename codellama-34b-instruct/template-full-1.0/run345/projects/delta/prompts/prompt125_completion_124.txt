  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return false;
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a boolean value, instead of the expected Delta object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('Invalid operation');
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would throw an error, instead of returning a Delta object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return null, instead of the expected Delta object.

DONE.
