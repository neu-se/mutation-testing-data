  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of `isZero()`, so the resulting code would produce the opposite behavior of the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite()` checks for positive or negative infinity, while `isZero()` only checks for zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== b & a !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&` operator performs a bitwise AND operation on the results of the two comparisons, while the original code fragment used a logical AND operation. Additionally, this new code fragment includes a check for `a` being non-zero, which is not present in the original code fragment.

DONE.
