Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the existence of the country in the `countries` object differently, potentially allowing for a country to be memoized even if it already exists, leading to unnecessary recomputation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it will always return an empty object if the country is not found, which could lead to unexpected results in the `deliverCountry` function, as it would not trigger the memoization logic correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[Object.keys(countries)[0]]
```
This would result in different behavior because it retrieves the first country in the `countries` object instead of the country corresponding to the provided `id`, which would lead to incorrect data being returned for the requested country.

DONE.
