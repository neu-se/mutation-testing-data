Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the complex number is zero instead of checking if it is infinite, which would lead to returning `Complex['ZERO']` for zero values instead of handling infinite values correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the real part of the complex number is greater than zero, which is unrelated to whether the complex number is infinite, potentially leading to incorrect results for complex numbers that are infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the imaginary part of the complex number is less than zero, which does not relate to the concept of infinity and would incorrectly return `Complex['ZERO']` for complex numbers with negative imaginary parts.

DONE.
