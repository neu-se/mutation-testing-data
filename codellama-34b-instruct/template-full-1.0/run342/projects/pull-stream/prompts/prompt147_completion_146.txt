  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values()` returns an array of the values of an object's own enumerable string-keyed properties, while `Object.keys()` returns an array of the own string-keyed property names of an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries()` returns an array of key-value pairs, while `Object.keys()` returns an array of the own string-keyed property names of an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(object).length
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys(object).length` returns the length of the array returned by `Object.keys()`, while `Object.keys(object)` returns an array of the own string-keyed property names of an object.

DONE.
