 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => this.emit('load', 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new function expression, which may not have the correct context (`this`) when called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
global.emit('load', 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits the 'load' event on the global object, rather than the current instance of the Dirty class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
process.emit('load', 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits the 'load' event on the process object, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
