  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b + b * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `*` operator to multiply `a` and `b`, while this code fragment uses the `+` operator to add `a` and `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b - b * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `*` operator to multiply `a` and `b`, while this code fragment uses the `-` operator to subtract `b` from `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `*` operator to multiply `a` and `b`, while this code fragment uses the `+` operator to add `a` and `b`.

DONE.
