 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
"string".length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `[Symbol.match]` method expects a string as its argument, but it would receive a number instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.spec
```
This would result in different behavior because the `[Symbol.match]` method expects a string as its argument, but it would receive a `spec` property of the `Matcher` class instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
"invalid_string"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `[Symbol.match]` method expects a string that matches the regular expression, but it would receive a string that doesn't match the regular expression.

DONE.
