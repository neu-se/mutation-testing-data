  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value in JavaScript, and it would be passed as an argument to `then` instead of `undefined`, which could potentially cause the promise to be fulfilled with a different value than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a valid value in JavaScript, and it would be passed as an argument to `then` instead of `null`, which could potentially cause the promise to be fulfilled with a different value than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("PLACEHOLDER")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with an error, which could potentially cause the program to crash or behave in an unexpected way.

DONE.
