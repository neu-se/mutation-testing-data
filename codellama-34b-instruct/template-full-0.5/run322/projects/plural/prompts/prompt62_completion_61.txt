  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('bacterium', 'bacteriums')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code adds the plural "s" to the word "bacterium", while this code fragment adds the plural "s" to the word "bacteriums".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('bacterium', 'bacteria')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code adds the plural "s" to the word "bacterium", while this code fragment adds the plural "ia" to the word "bacterium".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('bacterium', 'bacteria')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code adds the plural "s" to the word "bacterium", while this code fragment adds the plural "ia" to the word "bacterium".

DONE.
