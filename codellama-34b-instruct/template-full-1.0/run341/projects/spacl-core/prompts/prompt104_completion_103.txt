  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.has
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.has` checks if the policy is present in the collection, while `this.get` retrieves the policy from the collection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(policy.id)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.get(policy.id)` retrieves the policy with the given id from the collection, while `this.get` retrieves the policy with the given key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.values().filter(p => p.name === name)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.values().filter(p => p.name === name)` retrieves all the policies with the given name from the collection, while `this.get(name)` retrieves the first policy with the given name.

DONE.
