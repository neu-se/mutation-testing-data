Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` method would attempt to call `null.query(...)`, leading to a runtime error instead of iterating through the rules, which would not be caught by tests that expect valid rule objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule = this.rules[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only evaluate the first rule in the `rules` array, potentially ignoring other rules that may allow or deny the action, leading to incorrect access control decisions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule = this.rules.length > 0 ? this.rules[1] : null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to query the second rule if it exists, and if not, it would return `null`, which could lead to incorrect results if the first rule is the only one that governs the action.

DONE.
