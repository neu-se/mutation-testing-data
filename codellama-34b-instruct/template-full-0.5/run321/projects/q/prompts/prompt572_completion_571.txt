  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` keyword refers to the global object (window) in non-strict mode, while `null` would result in a `TypeError` being thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` keyword refers to the global object (window) in non-strict mode, while `undefined` would result in a `TypeError` being thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` keyword refers to the global object (window) in non-strict mode, while `0` would result in a `TypeError` being thrown.

DONE.
