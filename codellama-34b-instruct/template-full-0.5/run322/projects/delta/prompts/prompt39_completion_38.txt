  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because if the `key` is not present in the `a` object, the original code would return `undefined`, while the new code would return the value of `b[key]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] === null
```
This would result in different behavior because if the `key` is not present in the `a` object, the original code would return `undefined`, while the new code would return `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because if the `key` is not present in the `a` object, the original code would return `undefined`, while the new code would return `0`.

DONE.
