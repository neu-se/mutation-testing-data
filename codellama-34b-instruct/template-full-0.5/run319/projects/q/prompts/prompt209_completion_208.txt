  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(this, arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` context would be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(null, arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` context would be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(undefined, arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` context would be different.

DONE.
