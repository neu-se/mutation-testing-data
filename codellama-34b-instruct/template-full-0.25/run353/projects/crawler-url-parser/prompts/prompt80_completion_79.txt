  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href', 'javascript:void(0)');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return the value of the `href` attribute, while the modified code fragment would return `javascript:void(0)`, which is a JavaScript expression that does nothing and returns `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href', 'http://example.com');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return the value of the `href` attribute, while the modified code fragment would return `http://example.com`, which is a different URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href', '');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return the value of the `href` attribute, while the modified code fragment would return an empty string, which is a different value.

DONE.
