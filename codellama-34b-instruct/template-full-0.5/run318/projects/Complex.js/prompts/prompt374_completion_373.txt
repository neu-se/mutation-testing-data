  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `2 * a` expression would be evaluated to a different value than `2 * b`, which is the original expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `2 * (a + b)` expression would be evaluated to a different value than `2 * b`, which is the original expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (a - b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `2 * (a - b)` expression would be evaluated to a different value than `2 * b`, which is the original expression.

DONE.
