  Option 1: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
if (!isNaN(tokens[i + 1]))
```
This would result in different behavior because the check for the imaginary unit ('i') is missing, and the code would treat any non-NaN value as imaginary.

Option 2: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
if (tokens[i + 1] === 'e')
```
This would result in different behavior because the check for the exponential operator ('e') is unnecessary, and the code would consider any value after the imaginary unit as imaginary.

Option 3: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
if (typeof tokens[i + 1] === 'string')
```
This would result in different behavior because the check for the imaginary unit ('i' or 'I') is missing, and the code would treat any string value after the imaginary unit as imaginary.

DONE.
