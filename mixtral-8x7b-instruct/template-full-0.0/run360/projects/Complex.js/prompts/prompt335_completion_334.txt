 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / Math.atan
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the atan function, which would lead to incorrect results in the acot function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan2.bind(null, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it always uses the y-coordinate as the first argument for atan2, which would lead to incorrect results when the x-coordinate is not zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atanh
```
This would result in different behavior because atanh is the inverse hyperbolic tangent, not the regular arctangent. This would lead to incorrect results in the atan function.

DONE.
