  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because both the `slashesDenoteHost` and `search` options would be set to `false`, which could cause the `URL.parse()` method to not treat the first
