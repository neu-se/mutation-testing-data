  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src + 'foo'
```
This code fragment will append the string 'foo' to the value of the `src` variable, which is a string. This change will cause the `zipArchive.directory()` method to receive a different input than the original code, which may cause the method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.toUpperCase()
```
This code fragment will convert the value of the `src` variable to uppercase, which may cause the `zipArchive.directory()` method to receive a different input than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This code fragment will reverse the order of the characters in the `src` variable, which may cause the `zipArchive.directory()` method to receive a different input than the original code.

DONE.
