  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.domain != pageurl.domain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return "external" for non-matching domains, which is incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.host != pageurl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return "external" for non-matching hosts, which is incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.domain.length != pageurl.domain.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return "external" for domains of different length, which is incorrect.

DONE.
