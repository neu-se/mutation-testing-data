  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` callback would be called with a `null` argument, which would indicate that the stream has ended successfully.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(new Error('test error'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` callback would be called with an `Error` object, which would indicate that an error has occurred while processing the stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` callback would be called with a `true` argument, which would indicate that the stream has ended successfully and that the `op` function should not be called again.

DONE.
