  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.push(reason.stack);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the stack trace of the rejected promise to the `unhandledReasons` array, which would provide more information about the cause of the rejection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.push(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the reason object itself to the `unhandledReasons` array, which would provide more information about the cause of the rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.push(reason.message);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the message property of the reason object to the `unhandledReasons` array, which would provide more information about the cause of the rejection.

DONE.
