  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it only accesses the first element of the `coordinates` array, while the original code fragment accesses all two elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates[0] + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 180 degrees to the first element of the `coordinates` array, while the original code fragment does not perform any arithmetic operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates[1] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the second element of the `coordinates` array by 2, while the original code fragment does not perform any arithmetic operations.

DONE.
