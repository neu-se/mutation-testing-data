  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `args` variable, which is not defined in the scope of the function, instead of the `arguments` object, which is a built-in object that holds the values of the arguments passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the `arguments` object, starting from the second element, instead of using the `arguments` object directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `slice()` method of the `arguments` object, which is a built-in method for slicing arrays, instead of the `array_slice()` function, which is a non-standard method for slicing arrays.

DONE.
