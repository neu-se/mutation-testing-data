  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof options === 'boolean'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would falsely return true for a boolean value, whereas the original code would return true for a string value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof options !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would falsely return false for a string value, whereas the original code would return true for a string value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options instanceof String
```
This would result in different behavior because it would falsely return false for a string literal, whereas the original code would return true for a string literal.

DONE.
