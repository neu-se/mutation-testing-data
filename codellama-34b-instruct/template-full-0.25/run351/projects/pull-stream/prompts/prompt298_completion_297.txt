  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call, while the new code fragment `cb(null, data)` is a function call with two arguments, which would cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call, while the new code fragment `cb(true)` is a function call with one argument, which would cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call, while the new code fragment `cb(false)` is a function call with one argument, which would cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
