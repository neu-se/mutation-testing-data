  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err == false
```
This would result in different behavior because `err == false` would always be false, even if `err` is `true`, which would cause the `nextStream()` function to be called instead of the `nextChunk()` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err != true
```
This would result in different behavior because `err != true` would always be true, even if `err` is `true`, which would cause the `nextStream()` function to be called instead of the `nextChunk()` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because `err !== true` would always be true, even if `err` is `true`, which would cause the `nextStream()` function to be called instead of the `nextChunk()` function.

DONE.
