Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!node.isFile() && (flagsNum !== FLAGS.w)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the node is not a file and the flags do not include write permission, instead of checking if the node is a directory and the flags do not include read permission.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
node.isDirectory() && (flagsNum & FLAGS.w)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the node is a directory and the flags include write permission, instead of checking if the node is a directory and the flags do not include read permission.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!node.isDirectory() && (flagsNum !== FLAGS.r)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the node is not a directory and the flags do not include read permission, instead of checking if the node is a directory and the flags do not include read permission.

DONE.
