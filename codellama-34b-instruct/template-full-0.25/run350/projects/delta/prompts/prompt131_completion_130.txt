  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push(newOp.insert);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only push the `insert` property of the `newOp` object onto the `ops` array, rather than the entire `newOp` object. This could potentially cause issues if the `ops` array is expected to contain complete `Op` objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push(newOp.retain);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only push the `retain` property of the `newOp` object onto the `ops` array, rather than the entire `newOp` object. This could potentially cause issues if the `ops` array is expected to contain complete `Op` objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push(newOp.attributes);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only push the `attributes` property of the `newOp` object onto the `ops` array, rather
