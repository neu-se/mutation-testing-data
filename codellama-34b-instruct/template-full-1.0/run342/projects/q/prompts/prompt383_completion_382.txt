  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed the fulfilled value to the callback, while the modified code fragment passes `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed the fulfilled value to the callback, while the modified code fragment passes `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error('different error'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the fulfilled value to the callback, while the modified code fragment passes a rejected promise with a different error message.

DONE.
