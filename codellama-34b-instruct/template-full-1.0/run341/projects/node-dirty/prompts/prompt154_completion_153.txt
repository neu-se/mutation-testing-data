  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `this._readStream.pipe(this._writeStream);`

This would result in different behavior because the `pipe()` method is used to connect the `readable` stream to the `writable` stream, allowing data to flow from the `readable` stream to the `writable` stream without the need for manual calls to `write()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `this._writeStream.write(['', this.path]);`

This would result in different behavior because an array of strings is being written to the `writeStream`, whereas the original code writes a string representation of the `path` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `this._writeStream.write(JSON.stringify(this.path, null, 2));`

This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.stringify()` method is being used to convert the `path` property to a JSON string with a 2-space indentation.

DONE.
