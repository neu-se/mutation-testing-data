  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.call(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `array_slice` method on the `arguments` object, which would result in a different array being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.apply(null, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `array_slice` method on the `arguments` object, but with a different `this` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.bind(null, arguments)()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `array_slice` method on the `arguments` object, but with a different `this` value and a different set of arguments.

DONE.
