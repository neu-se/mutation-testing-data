  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a function that returns a promise, whereas `null` is a null value that cannot be called as a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a function that returns a promise, whereas `undefined` is a value that cannot be called as a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a function that returns a promise, whereas `promise.reject()` is a function that immediately rejects a promise with the provided reason.

DONE.
