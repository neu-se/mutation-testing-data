  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ1 * cosδ + cosφ1 * sinδ * cosθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `sinφ2` variable, which is not defined in the provided code snippet.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosφ1 * sinδ * cosθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `sinφ2` variable, which is not defined in the provided code snippet.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ1 * cosδ + cosφ1 * sinδ * sinθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `sinφ2` variable, which is not defined in the provided code snippet.

DONE.
