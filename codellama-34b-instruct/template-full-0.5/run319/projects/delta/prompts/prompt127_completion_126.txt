  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `iter.next()` method to be called twice, which would advance the iterator by two positions instead of one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `iter.next()` method to be called with an argument of 2, which would advance the iterator by two positions instead of one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(index)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `iter.next()` method to be called with an argument of `index`, which would advance the iterator by `index` positions instead of one.

DONE.
