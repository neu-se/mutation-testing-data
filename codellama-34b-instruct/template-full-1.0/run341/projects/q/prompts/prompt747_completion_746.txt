  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(null, onRejected, onProgress)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onFulfilled` callback is not provided, so the promise resolution will not be affected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(onFulfilled, null, onProgress)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onRejected` callback is not provided, so the promise rejection will not be affected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(onFulfilled, onRejected, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onProgress` callback is not provided, so the promise progress will not be affected.

DONE.
