  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.slice(0, unhandledReasons.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return all but the last element of the `unhandledReasons` array, rather than all elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.slice(1, unhandledReasons.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return all elements of the `unhandledReasons` array except the first one, rather than all elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.slice(0, unhandledReasons.length - 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return all but the last two elements of the `unhandledReasons` array, rather than all elements.

DONE.
