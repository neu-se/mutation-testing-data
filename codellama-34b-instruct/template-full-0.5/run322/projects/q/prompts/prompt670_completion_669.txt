  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, args[0]]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first argument of the `args` array, rather than the entire array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, [args]]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a nested array, with the `args` array as the only element, rather than passing the `args` array directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, args.slice(1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass all but the first element of the `args` array, rather than passing the entire array.

DONE.
