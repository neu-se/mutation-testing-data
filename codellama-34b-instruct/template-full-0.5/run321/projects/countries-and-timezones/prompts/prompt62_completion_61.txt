  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"id"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string "id" is not a valid identifier, and would likely cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the `id` variable would be incremented by 1, which could cause the program to behave differently if it relies on the value of the `id` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the `id` variable would be doubled, which could cause the program to behave differently if it relies on the value of the `id` variable.

DONE.
