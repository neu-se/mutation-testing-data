Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `newOp.attributes` has any keys instead of checking if `attributes` has any keys, potentially allowing an empty `attributes` object to be treated as valid.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to false, causing the `newOp` to never have attributes assigned, even if valid attributes were provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if `attributes` is strictly `undefined`, ignoring cases where `attributes` is `null` or an empty object, which would lead to incorrect handling of attributes.

DONE.
