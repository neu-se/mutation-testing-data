Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
path.join(targetPath, path.basename(source))
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the way the target path is constructed, potentially leading to incorrect file copying.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
source.replace(currentPath, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the base path from the source path instead of replacing it with the target path, potentially leading to incorrect file copying.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
path.dirname(targetPath) + '/' + path.basename(source)
```
This would result in different behavior because it constructs the target path by concatenating the directory name of the target path with the base name of the source path, potentially leading to incorrect file copying if the target path has a different directory structure.

DONE.
