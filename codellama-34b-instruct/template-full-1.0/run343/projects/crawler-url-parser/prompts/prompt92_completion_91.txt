  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href*=^javascript|mailto|ftp
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a different regular expression than the original code fragment, which could cause some links to be excluded from the list of extracted links.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href*=^http|https
```
This would result in different behavior because it only allows links that start with "http" or "https", whereas the original code fragment allows any link that starts with "//".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href*=^www.domain.com
```
This would result in different behavior because it only allows links that start with "www.domain.com", whereas the original code fragment allows any link that starts with the base URL.

DONE.
