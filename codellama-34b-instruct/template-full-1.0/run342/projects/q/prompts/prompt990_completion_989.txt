  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `arguments` to refer to the function's arguments, while `0` would simply evaluate to the number zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `arguments` to refer to the function's arguments, while `null` would be a null reference error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `arguments` to refer to the function's arguments, while `array_slice(arguments, 2)` would refer to the array of arguments starting from the third argument.

DONE.
