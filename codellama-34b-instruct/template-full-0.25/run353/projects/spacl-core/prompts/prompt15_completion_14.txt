  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` is a different method than `match`, and it would return the index of the first match rather than a boolean indicating whether a match was found.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` is a different method than `match`, and it would return a boolean indicating whether the substring is included in the string, rather than a boolean indicating whether a match was found.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` is a different method than `match`, and it would return the index of the first occurrence of the substring, rather than a boolean indicating whether a match was found.

DONE.
