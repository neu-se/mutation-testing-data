  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.transformPosition + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would shift the position of the transform by 1, potentially causing the transform to be applied to a different part of the document.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.transformPosition - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would shift the position of the transform by -1, potentially causing the transform to be applied to a different part of the document.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.transformPosition * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the position of the transform, potentially causing the transform to be applied to a different part of the document.

DONE.
