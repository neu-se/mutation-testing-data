  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes the last element from the array, whereas `splice` removes the element at the given index (in this case, the element at index `atReport`).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.shift();
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` removes the first element from the array, whereas `splice` removes the element at the given index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.push();
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` adds a new element to the end of the array, whereas `splice` removes an element from the array.

DONE.
