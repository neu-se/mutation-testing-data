  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.parse` expects a string as input, while `URL.resolve` expects a URL object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.format
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.format` returns a string, while `URL.resolve` returns a URL object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolveObject
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.resolveObject` returns a URL object with the resolved URL, while `URL.resolve` returns a string with the resolved URL.

DONE.
