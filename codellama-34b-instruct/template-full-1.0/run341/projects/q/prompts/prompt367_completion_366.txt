  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw exception
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a rejected promise, while the modified code fragment throws an exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(new Error("This is a different error message"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a rejected promise with a specific error message, while the modified code fragment returns a rejected promise with a different error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a rejected promise, while the modified code fragment returns a rejected promise using a different function.

DONE.
