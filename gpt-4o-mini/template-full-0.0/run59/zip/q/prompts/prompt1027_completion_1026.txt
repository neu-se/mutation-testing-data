Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition will always evaluate to true, causing the `nodeback` function to be called regardless of whether a `nodeback` was provided, potentially leading to an error if `nodeback` is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition will always evaluate to false, preventing the `nodeback` function from being called, and thus the promise will not resolve to the callback, which may lead to unhandled promise rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `nodeback` is not strictly equal to `undefined`, which could lead to the `nodeback` function not being called if it is defined but falsy (e.g., `null` or `0`), thus altering the expected behavior of the function.

DONE.
