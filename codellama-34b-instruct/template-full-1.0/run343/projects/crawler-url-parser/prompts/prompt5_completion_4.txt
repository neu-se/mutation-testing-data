  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `null` immediately, which would prevent the function from performing any further checks on the input string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return !_has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the opposite of what it should return. If the input string contains illegal characters, the function should return `null`, but with this replacement, it would return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return currentUrlStr.indexOf("://") >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `true` if the input string contains a scheme (e.g. "http://"), but the original function would return `true` only if the input string contains illegal characters.

DONE.
