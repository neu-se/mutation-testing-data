 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression will no longer have a second alternative, potentially causing it to match or not match differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/\/default\..+$/, '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression will now match any string ending with "/default." followed by any character(s), potentially causing it to match or not match differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/\/default\.[a-z]+|$/, '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression will now match either strings ending with "/default." followed by one or more lowercase letters or an end-of-line, potentially causing it to match or not match differently.

DONE.
