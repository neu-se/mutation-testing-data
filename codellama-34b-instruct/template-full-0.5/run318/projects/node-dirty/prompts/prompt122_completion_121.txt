  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` event is not emitted when the write stream is closed, which could cause issues for code that is expecting the `error` event to be emitted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` event is not emitted when the write stream is closed, which could cause issues for code that is expecting the `close` event to be emitted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'write'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `write` event is not emitted when the write stream is closed, which could cause issues for code that is expecting the `write` event to be emitted.

DONE.
