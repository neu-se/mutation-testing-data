  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_hasOwnProperty` is a function that checks if an object has a property with the given name, whereas `object_toString` is a function that returns a string representation of an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_keys
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_keys` is a function that returns an array of the keys in an object, whereas `object_toString` is a function that returns a string representation of an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_values
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_values` is a function that returns an array of the values in an object, whereas `object_toString` is a function that returns a string representation of an object.

DONE.
