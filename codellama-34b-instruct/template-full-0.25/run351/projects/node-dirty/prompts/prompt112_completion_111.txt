  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer.slice(0, -1)}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method is called on `buffer`, which would return a new string that is a subset of the original string, excluding the last character. This would cause the error message to be different than the original code, which would result in a different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer.toUpperCase()}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase` method is called on `buffer`, which would return a new string that is the same as the original string, but with all characters in uppercase. This would cause the error message to be different than the original code, which would result in a different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(`Corrupted
