Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return when(result.value, callback, errback);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to call `callback` with the value of `result.value` instead of continuing the generator execution, potentially leading to incorrect handling of yielded promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return when(result.value, errback, callback);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would swap the positions of `callback` and `errback`, causing the success handler to be invoked in case of an error, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return when(result.value, function() { return null; }, errback);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the original `callback` with a function that always returns `null`, effectively ignoring the yielded value and potentially leading to unexpected results in the promise chain.

DONE.
