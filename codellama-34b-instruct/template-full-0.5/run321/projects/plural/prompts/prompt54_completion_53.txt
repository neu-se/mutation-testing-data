  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/ves$/i, 'ves')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the last letter of the word with 'ves', while this new code fragment replaces the last letter of the word with 'ves' only if it ends with 'ves'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/ves$/i, 'ves').replace(/ves$/i, 'ves')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the last letter of the word with 'ves', while this new code fragment replaces the last letter of the word with 'ves' twice.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/ves$/i, 'ves').replace(/ves$/i, 'ves').replace(/ves$/i, 'ves')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the last letter of the word with 'ves', while this new
