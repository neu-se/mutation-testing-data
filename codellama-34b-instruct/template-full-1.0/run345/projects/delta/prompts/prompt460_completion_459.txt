  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the length of the `ops` array, regardless of the current iteration index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the length of the `ops` array minus one, regardless of the current iteration index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the next iteration index, regardless of the current iteration index.

DONE.
