  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']();
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['isZero']()` checks if the current object is zero, which is not relevant to the context of the `Complex` class and may cause unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['re'] === 0` checks if the real part of the current object is equal to zero, which is relevant to the context of the `Complex` class and may cause expected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] === 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because `z['re'] === 0` checks if the real part of the `z` object is equal to zero, which is relevant to the context of the `Complex` class and may cause expected behavior.

DONE.
