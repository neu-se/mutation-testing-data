  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.has
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.has` checks if the map has the specified key, whereas `this.get` retrieves the value associated with the key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.set` sets the value associated with the key, whereas `this.get` retrieves the value associated with the key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.delete` removes the key-value pair from the map, whereas `this.get` retrieves the value associated with the key.

DONE.
