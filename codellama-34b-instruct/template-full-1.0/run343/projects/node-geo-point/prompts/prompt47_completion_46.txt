  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with different code fragments:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because `point2.latitude` is a different value than `point1.latitude`, which could change the result of the bearing calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because `point1.longitude` is a different value than `point1.latitude`, which could change the result of the bearing calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a constant value, whereas `point1.latitude` and `point2.latitude` are variables that could have different values.

DONE.
