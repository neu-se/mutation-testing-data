  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.allSettled
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.allSettled` resolves with an array of objects containing the value, reason, or fulfillment status of each promise, whereas `Q.all` resolves with an array of values for the fulfilled promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.anySettled
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.anySettled` resolves with the value of the first promise that settles (resolves or rejects), whereas `Q.any` resolves with the value of the first resolved promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.settled
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.settled` resolves with an array of objects containing the value, reason, or fulfillment status of each promise, whereas `Q.all` resolves with an array of values for the fulfilled promises.

DONE.
