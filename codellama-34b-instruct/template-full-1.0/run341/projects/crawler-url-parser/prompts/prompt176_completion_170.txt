  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.substr(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `url.substr(0)` returns the entire string, whereas `url` returns a reference to the string object, which may be modified by mutating the original string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `url.length` returns the length of the string, whereas `url` returns a reference to the string object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `url.toLowerCase()` returns a new string with all lowercase characters, whereas `url` returns a reference to the original string object.
