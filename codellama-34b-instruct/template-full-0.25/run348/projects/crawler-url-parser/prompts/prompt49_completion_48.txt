  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve(parsedBaseUrl, parsedUrl.pathname)
```
This would result in different behavior because `parsedUrl.pathname` would only include the pathname component of the URL, whereas `parsedUrl` includes the entire URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve(parsedBaseUrl, parsedUrl.search)
```
This would result in different behavior because `parsedUrl.search` would only include the search component of the URL, whereas `parsedUrl` includes the entire URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve(parsedBaseUrl, parsedUrl.hash)
```
This would result in different behavior because `parsedUrl.hash` would only include the hash component of the URL, whereas `parsedUrl` includes the entire URL.

DONE.
