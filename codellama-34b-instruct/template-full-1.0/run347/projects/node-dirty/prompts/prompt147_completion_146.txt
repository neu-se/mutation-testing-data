  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let cb;
```
This would result in different behavior because `let` is a block-scoped variable declaration, while `const` is not. In the original code, `const cb` is declared outside the loop, so it is not re-declared on each iteration. Replacing it with `let cb` would cause `cb` to be re-declared on each iteration, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var cb;
```
This would result in different behavior because `let` is a block-scoped variable declaration, while `var` is function-scoped. In the original code, `const cb` is declared outside the loop, so it is not re-declared on each iteration. Replacing it with `var cb` would cause `cb` to be re-declared on each iteration, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb => { ... }
