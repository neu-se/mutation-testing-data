  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(true, cb)
```
This change will cause the `read` function to be called with `true` as the first argument, which may cause it to return a different value than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(false, cb)
```
This change will cause the `read` function to be called with `false` as the first argument, which may cause it to return a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(null, cb)
```
This change will cause the `read` function to be called with `null` as the first argument, which may cause it to return a different value than the original code.

DONE.
