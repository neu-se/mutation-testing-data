 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new deferred object using the Q.defer() method instead of the defer() method local to the prototype. This could lead to unexpected behavior in the promise chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new deferred object using the Promise.defer() method instead of the defer() method local to the prototype. This could lead to unexpected behavior in the promise chain, and it is also not a standard method in the Promises/A+ specification.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to call the defer() method on the promise instance itself, which is not a function. This would cause the code to throw a TypeError, breaking the normal execution flow.

DONE.
