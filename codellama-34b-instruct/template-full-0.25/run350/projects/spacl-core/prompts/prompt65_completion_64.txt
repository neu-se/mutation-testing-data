  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...rules.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a shallow copy of the array, whereas the original code fragment returns a reference to the same array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...rules.concat([])
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat()` returns a new array that is the result of concatenating the original array with the given array, whereas the original code fragment returns a reference to the same array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...rules.filter(() => true)
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter()` returns a new array that contains only the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, whereas the original code fragment returns a reference to the same array.

DONE.
