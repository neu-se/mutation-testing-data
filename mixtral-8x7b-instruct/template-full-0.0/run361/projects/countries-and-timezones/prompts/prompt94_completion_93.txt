 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'0'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function would be called with a string '0' instead of a country ID, which could lead to unexpected results or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function would be called with `null` instead of a country ID, which could lead to errors or unexpected behavior in the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
