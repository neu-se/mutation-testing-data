  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the actually returned value from the `then` method, instead of returning a promise that resolves to that value. This change would break the function's ability to chain promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a rejected promise, instead of a resolved one. This change would cause the function to behave as if the promise had been rejected instead of resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect.bind(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a bound function, instead of a resolved promise. This change would cause the function to behave as if it had been called with a different context object.

DONE.
