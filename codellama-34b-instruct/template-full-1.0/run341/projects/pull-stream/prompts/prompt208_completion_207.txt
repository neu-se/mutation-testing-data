  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `aborted` which would have returned an error to the callback function, while the new code fragment would have returned `null` instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `aborted` which would have returned an error to the callback function, while the new code fragment would have returned `undefined` instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `aborted` which would have returned an error to the callback function, while the new code fragment would have returned an empty object instead.

DONE.
