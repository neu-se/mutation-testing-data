  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, whereas `void 0` is a special value that represents the absence of a value. In this context, `null` would cause the `apply` method to be called with `null` as the `this` value, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the function being called expects a specific object to be bound to `this`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the current execution context, whereas `void 0` is a special value that represents the absence of a value. In this context, `this` would cause the `apply` method to be called with the current execution context as the `this` value, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the function being called expects a specific object to be bound to `this`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0], args
```
This would
