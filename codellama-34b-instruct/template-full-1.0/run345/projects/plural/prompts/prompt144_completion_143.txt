  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[-1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule[-1]` would return the last element of the `rule` array, which in most cases would be a function that returns the plural form of a word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rules[0].regex.test(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because `rules[0].regex.test(word)` would return `true` if the word matches the regular expression in the first rule, but it would not return the correct plural form of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1](word)
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule[1](word)` would return the result of the first rule's function applied to the word, which in most cases would be the plural form of the word.

DONE.
