  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx.undefined` is not a valid property access and would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.unrelated
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx.unrelated` is a different property than `ctx` and may not be related to the policy query.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.path
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx.path` is a different property than `ctx` and may not be related to the policy query.

DONE.
