  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise with the error, while `deferred.reject` would reject the promise with the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` returns a function that resolves the promise, while `deferred.reject` would reject the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` would reject the promise with the error, while `deferred.reject` would reject the promise with the error.

DONE.
