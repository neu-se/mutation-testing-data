  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the `slice` method to start from the next index instead of the current index, potentially including additional elements in the resulting array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the `slice` method to start from the previous index instead of the current index, potentially excluding elements that should be included in the resulting array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length - this.index
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `slice` method to start from the end of the array instead of the beginning, potentially including elements that should not be included in the resulting array.

DONE.
