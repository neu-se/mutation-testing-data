  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("Q can't get fulfillment value from any promise, all promises were rejected."))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `any` function to reject with an error message, rather than resolving with the value of the first resolved promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(result)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `any` function to resolve with the value of the first resolved promise, rather than rejecting with an error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(promise, onFulfilled, onRejected, onProgress)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `any` function to wait for the `promise` to settle, rather than immediately resolving or rejecting with the value of the first resolved promise.

DONE.
