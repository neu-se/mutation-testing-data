 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
otherOp.delete !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider any `otherOp` with a truthy `delete` property as a delete operation, rather than checking if it is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof thisOp.retain !== 'boolean'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `thisOp.retain` is not a boolean, rather than checking if it is a number or an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisOp.retain !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if `thisOp.retain` is not null, rather than checking if it is a number or an object. This would not account for cases where `thisOp.retain` is undefined or any other non-number/object value.

DONE.
