  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite` treats numbers that are neither positive nor negative infinity as finite, whereas `isZero` treats all non-infinity numbers as non-zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] != 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `im` returns the imaginary part of the complex number, whereas `isInfinite` returns a boolean indicating whether the number is positive or negative infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `re` returns the real part of the complex number, whereas `isInfinite` returns a boolean indicating whether the number is positive or negative infinity.

DONE.
