  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data = data.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would remove the first character of the data, which could potentially change the JSON parsing result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data = data.replace('"', '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would remove all double quotes from the data, which could potentially change the JSON parsing result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data = data.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split`, `reverse`, and `join` methods would reverse the order of the characters in the data, which could potentially change the JSON parsing result.

DONE.
