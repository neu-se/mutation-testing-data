  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` and `substr` have different parameters and return values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substring
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring` and `substr` have different parameters and return values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.slice(0, -2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` and `substr` have different parameters and return values.

DONE.
