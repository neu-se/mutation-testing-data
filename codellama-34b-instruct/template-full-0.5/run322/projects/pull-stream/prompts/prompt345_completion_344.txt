  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === true ? null : abort

This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `abort` is equal to `true` and returns `null` if it is, while this replacement code fragment checks if `abort` is equal to `false` and returns `abort` if it is.
