  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments).slice(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the last element of the `arguments` array, rather than the entire array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments).concat([null])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append `null` to the end of the `arguments` array, rather than passing the array as-is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a reversed version of the `arguments` array, rather than passing the array as-is.

DONE.
