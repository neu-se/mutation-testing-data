  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
misc.concat(clothes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the `clothes` array to the `misc` array, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
misc.filter(function(word) { return word !== 'clothes' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the word 'clothes' from the `misc` array, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
misc.map(function(word) { return word.replace('clothes', 'cloth') })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the word 'clothes' with 'cloth' in the `misc` array, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
