  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because when the promise is fulfilled, the node resolver will be called with the value, instead of the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because when the promise is rejected, the node resolver will be called with the error, instead of the value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify()
```
This would result in different behavior because when the promise is fulfilled, the node resolver will be called with the value, instead of the error.

DONE.
