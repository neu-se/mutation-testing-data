  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [value, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.set()` method would receive the arguments in the opposite order, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key + 1, value]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.set()` method would receive a modified key, which could cause the method to operate on the wrong property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key, value * 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.set()` method would receive a modified value, which could cause the property to be set to an unexpected value.

DONE.
