 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/\/index\..+$/, '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches any string that starts with "/index." followed by any character(s), instead of matching only lowercase alphabets.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/i, '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the "i" flag makes the regex case-insensitive, which would allow it to match uppercase alphabets as well.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/\/index\.[a-z]+\//, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the matched string instead of replacing it with "/".

DONE.
