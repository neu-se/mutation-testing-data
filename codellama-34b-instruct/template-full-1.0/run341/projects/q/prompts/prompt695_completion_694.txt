  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a value that is
different from `object`, which could cause the function to return a
different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` is a different value
than `object`, and could cause the function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value
than `object`, and could cause the function to return a different result.

DONE.
