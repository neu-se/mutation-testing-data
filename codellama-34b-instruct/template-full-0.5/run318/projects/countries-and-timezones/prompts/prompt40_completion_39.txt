  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.assign({}, prev, { [id]: getCountry(id, options) });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not spread the `prev` object, which could cause issues if the `prev` object has properties that are not intended to be overwritten by the `getCountry` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.assign({}, prev, { [id]: getCountry(id, options) }, { deprecated: true });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a `deprecated` property to the returned object, which could cause issues if the `deprecated` property is not handled correctly by the code that uses the returned object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.assign({}, prev, { [id]: getCountry(id, options) }, { foo: 'bar' });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a `foo` property with the value `'bar'`
