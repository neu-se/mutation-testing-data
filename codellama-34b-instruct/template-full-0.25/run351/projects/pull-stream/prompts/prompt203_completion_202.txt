  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `end` variable, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if `end` is `null` or `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator adds 1 to the `end` variable, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if `end` is `null` or `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operator subtracts 1 from the `end` variable, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if `end` is `null` or `undefined`.

DONE.
