  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(accum, curr, index) => accum + curr
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `predicate` function to determine which elements to include in the resulting array, while this new code simply adds all elements together.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(accum, curr, index) => accum - curr
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `predicate` function to determine which elements to include in the resulting array, while this new code simply subtracts all elements from the accumulator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(accum, curr, index) => accum * curr
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `predicate` function to determine which elements to include in the resulting array, while this new code simply multiplies all elements together.

DONE.
