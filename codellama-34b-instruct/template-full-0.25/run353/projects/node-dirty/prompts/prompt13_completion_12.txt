  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.push(cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cbs.push(cb)` statement would be executed unconditionally, even if the `if` condition is not met.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.push(cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cbs.push(cb)` statement would be executed unconditionally, even if the `if` condition is not met.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.push(cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cbs.push(cb)` statement would be executed unconditionally, even if the `if` condition is not met.

DONE.
