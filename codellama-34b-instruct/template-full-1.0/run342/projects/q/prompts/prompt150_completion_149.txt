  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p.stack.slice(p.stackCounter + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would remove the last element of the `stack` array, which is the current frame, and only include the previous frames in the concatenated stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p.stack.pop(p.stackCounter)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop` method would remove and return the last element of the `stack` array, which is the current frame, and only include the previous frames in the concatenated stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p.stack.splice(p.stackCounter + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would remove the last element of the `stack` array, which is the current frame, and only include the previous frames in the concatenated stack trace.

DONE.
