  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a function that takes a single argument, while the modified code fragment returns the result of calling that function with no arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(deferred.reject)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a function that takes a single argument, while the modified code fragment returns the result of calling that function with the `deferred.reject` function as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a function that takes a single argument, while the modified code fragment returns the result of calling that function with an empty function as an argument.

DONE.
