  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error, "stack", {value: stack, enumerable: true}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `enumerable` property is set to `true`, which means that the property will be included in the `for...in` loop, unlike the original code where it was set to `false`.
