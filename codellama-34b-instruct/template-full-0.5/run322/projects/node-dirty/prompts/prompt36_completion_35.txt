  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var [key, val] = this._data.entries();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the entries of the Map, rather than the keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var [key, val] = this._data.keys();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the keys of the Map, rather than the entries.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var [key, val] = this._data.values();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the values of the Map, rather than the entries.

DONE.
