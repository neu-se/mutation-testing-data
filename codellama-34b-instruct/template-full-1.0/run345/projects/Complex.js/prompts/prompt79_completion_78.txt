  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
c === ' ' || c === '\t' || c === '\r'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking for spaces, tabs, and line breaks, but the new code fragment is also checking for carriage returns.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
c === ' ' || c === '\t' || c === '\v'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking for spaces, tabs, and line breaks, but the new code fragment is also checking for vertical tabs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
c === ' ' || c === '\t' || c === ','
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking for spaces, tabs, and line breaks, but the new code fragment is also checking for commas.

DONE.
