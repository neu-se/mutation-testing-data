  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] * loh + z['re'] * arg
```
This would result in different behavior because the signs of the terms are swapped, which would cause the resulting complex number to have a different magnitude and phase.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] * loh - z['re'] * arg
```
This would result in different behavior because the signs of the terms are swapped, which would cause the resulting complex number to have a different magnitude and phase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] * loh + z['im'] * arg
```
This would result in different behavior because the signs of the terms are swapped, which would cause the resulting complex number to have a different magnitude and phase.

DONE.
