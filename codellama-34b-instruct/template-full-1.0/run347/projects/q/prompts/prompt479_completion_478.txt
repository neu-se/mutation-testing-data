  Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with: `at - 1`.
This would result in different behavior because `at` refers to the index of the element in the array, and `at - 1` would be the index of the previous element in the array.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with: `at + 1`.
This would result in different behavior because `at` refers to the index of the element in the array, and `at + 1` would be the index of the next element in the array.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with: `promise`.
This would result in different behavior because `promise` is the object that is being checked for in the `unhandledRejections` array, and `at` is the index of that object in the array. By replacing `at` with `promise`, the code would be checking if `promise` is in the `unhandledRejections` array, rather than checking if the object at a particular index is in the array.
