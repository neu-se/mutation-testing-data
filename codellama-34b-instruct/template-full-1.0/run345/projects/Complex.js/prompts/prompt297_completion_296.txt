  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER in the code with buggy code fragments that have different behavior:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh(a) + cosh(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinh` and `cosh` are functions of the same number, but `sinh(a) + cosh(b)` would have a different value because it is the sum of the hyperbolic sine of `a` and the hyperbolic cosine of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh(b) + cosh(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinh` and `cosh` are functions of different numbers, but the order of the operands is reversed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh(b) + sinh(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cosh` and `sinh` are functions of
