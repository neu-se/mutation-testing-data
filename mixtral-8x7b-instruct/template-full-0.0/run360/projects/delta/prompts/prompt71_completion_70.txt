 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'attributes'.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns 9, the string length of 'attributes', instead of checking if the attributes object has any properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns 0, which would prevent the newOp from being pushed into the array if there are no attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(attributes, '0')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the attributes object has a property named '0', which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
