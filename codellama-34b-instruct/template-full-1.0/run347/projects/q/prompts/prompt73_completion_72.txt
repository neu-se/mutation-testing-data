  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator would negate the value, resulting in a different delay for the `flush` function to be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because the constant `42` would be used as the delay instead of `0`, resulting in a longer delay for the `flush` function to be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `{}` object would be used as the first argument to `setTimeout`, which would cause the `flush` function to be called with an invalid argument.

DONE.
