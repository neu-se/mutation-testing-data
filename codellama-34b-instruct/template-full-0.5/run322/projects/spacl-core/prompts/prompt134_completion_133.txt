  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const verb in this.verbs)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the properties of the `this.verbs` object, rather than the values of the `this.verbs` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const verb of this.verbs)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the values of the `this.verbs` object, rather than the properties of the `this.verbs` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const verb in this.verbs.values())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the values of the `this.verbs` object, rather than the properties of the `this.verbs` object.

DONE.
