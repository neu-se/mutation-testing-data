  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ctx` is `undefined`, while the new code fragment checks if it is not `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ctx` is `undefined`, while the new code fragment checks if its `length` property is `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.props.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ctx` is `undefined`, while the new code fragment checks if its `props` property is an empty array.

DONE.
