  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.nextTick(flush);
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush` would be passed as a callback to `process.nextTick`, but the `flush` function is not defined until later in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` would delay the execution of `flush` until the next event loop iteration, while `process.nextTick` would execute `flush` immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setImmediate(flush);
```
This would result in different behavior because `setImmediate` would execute `flush` at the highest priority, while `process.nextTick` and `setTimeout` would execute `flush` at a lower priority.

DONE.
