  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `nextTick` to schedule a task to be executed in the next event loop, while `return` would simply return from the current function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `nextTick` to schedule a task to be executed in the next event loop, while `throw new Error()` would throw an error immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(() => {
    throw new Error();
}, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `nextTick` to schedule a task to be executed in the next event loop, while `setTimeout` would schedule a task to be executed after a delay of 0 milliseconds.

DONE.
