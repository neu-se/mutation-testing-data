  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is a function that returns a promise, but `defer(null)` would return a rejected promise with a `null` value, which would cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is a function that returns a promise, but `defer(undefined)` would return a rejected promise with an `undefined` value, which would cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is a function that returns a promise, but `defer(true)` would return a resolved promise with a `true` value, which would cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
