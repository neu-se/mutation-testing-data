  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is a variable that is not defined in the code snippet, so it would cause a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because `1` is a number, and it would be used as the input to the `parse` function, which expects a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"1"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"1"` is a string, and it would be used as the input to the `parse` function, which expects a string.

DONE.
