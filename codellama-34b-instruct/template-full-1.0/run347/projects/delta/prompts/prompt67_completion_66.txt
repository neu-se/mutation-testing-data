  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a different method than `push`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `null` instead of a `this` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` is a different method than `push`.

DONE.
