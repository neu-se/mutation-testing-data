  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(undefined));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed a value to `deferred.makeNodeResolver()`, while the modified code fragment passes `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(null));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed a value to `deferred.makeNodeResolver()`, while the modified code fragment passes `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(function(){}));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed a value to `deferred.makeNodeResolver()`, while the modified code fragment passes a function.

DONE.
