  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "undefined" && typeof self !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the && operator requires both operands to be truthy, whereas the || operator only requires one operand to be truthy. In this case, if the PLACEHOLDER is replaced with &&, the code would only execute if both window and self are defined, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "undefined" ^ typeof self !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the ^ operator performs a bitwise XOR operation, which is not equivalent to the logical OR operation performed by ||. In this case, if the PLACEHOLDER is replaced with ^, the code would execute if either window or self is defined, but not if both are undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "undefined" || typeof self !== "undefined" || true
```
This would result in different
