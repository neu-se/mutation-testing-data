 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/fe?$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression will always match the last two characters of the input string, instead of using the provided regex variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new RegExp('fe?$', 'i')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression will be created as a new instance every time the function is called, which may cause unexpected behavior or memory leaks.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/fe$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression will only match strings ending with "fe", instead of matching strings ending with either "fe" or "f".

DONE.
