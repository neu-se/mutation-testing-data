  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest = path.resolve(__dirname, '../');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path.resolve` function would return a path that is one level higher than the current directory, which could cause the `image` function to write the downloaded image to a different location than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest = path.resolve(__dirname, '../../');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path.resolve` function would return a path that is two levels higher than the current directory, which could cause the `image` function to write the downloaded image to a different location than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest = path.resolve(__dirname, '../../../');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path.resolve` function would return a path that is three levels higher than the current directory, which could cause the `image` function to write the downloaded image to a different location than
