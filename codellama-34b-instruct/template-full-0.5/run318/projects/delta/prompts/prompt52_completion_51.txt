  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be adding 1 to the value of `b`, which could change the outcome of the `Object.keys()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be adding 1 to the value of `a`, which could change the outcome of the `Object.keys()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be adding the values of `a` and `b`, which could change the outcome of the `Object.keys()` method.

DONE.
