  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `elem.insert` is not `null`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `elem.insert` is not `null`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `elem.insert` is not `null`, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
