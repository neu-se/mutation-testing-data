  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `Op.length` returns the length of the operation (number of characters), while `Op.length + 1` would return the length plus one, potentially leading to an incorrect calculation in the `length()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `Op.length - 1` would return the length minus one, potentially leading to an incorrect calculation in the `length()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `Op.length * 2` would return the length multiplied by two, potentially leading to an incorrect calculation in the `length()` method.

DONE.
