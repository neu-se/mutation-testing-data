  Option 1: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaFFinite']() || z['isNaFFinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `isInfinite` method with `isNaFFinite`, which is not a valid method in the Complex class.

Option 2: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the logical `OR` operator to a logical `AND` operator.

Option 3: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() ^ z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `OR` operator with an exclusive `OR` operation, which checks if one and only one of the operands is `true`.

DONE.
