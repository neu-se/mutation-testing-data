  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `read` function to be called with `false` instead of `ended`, which could potentially cause the function to return a different result or error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `read` function to be called with `true` instead of `ended`, which could potentially cause the function to return a different result or error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `read` function to be called with `true` instead of `ended`, which could potentially cause the function to return a different result or error.

DONE.
