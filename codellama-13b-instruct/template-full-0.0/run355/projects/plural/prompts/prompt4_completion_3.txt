  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
8, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `slice()` is now `1`, which means that the function will return the first character of the string, rather than the last character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
8, -2
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `slice()` is now `-2`, which means that the function will return the second-to-last character of the string, rather than the last character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
8, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `slice()` is now `0`, which means that the function will return an empty string, rather than the last character of the string.

DONE.
