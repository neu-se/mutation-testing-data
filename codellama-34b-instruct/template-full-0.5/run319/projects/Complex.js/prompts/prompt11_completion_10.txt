  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sinh` and `Math.cosh` have different ranges and domains, and can produce different results for the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tanh
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tanh` and `Math.cosh` have different ranges and domains, and can produce different results for the same input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.asinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.asinh` and `Math.cosh` have different ranges and domains, and can produce different results for the same input.

DONE.
