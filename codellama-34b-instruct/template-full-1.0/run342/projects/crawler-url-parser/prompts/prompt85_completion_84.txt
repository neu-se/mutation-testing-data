  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$.trimText().test()
```
This would result in different behavior because `$.trimText()` is a method that removes the whitespace from the beginning and end of a string, while `$.test()` is a method that searches for a match between a regular expression and a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$.not.text()
```
This would result in different behavior because `$.not` is a method that adds a class to an element, while `$.text()` is a method that returns the text content of an element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$.html()
```
This would result in different behavior because `$.html()` is a method that sets the HTML content of an element, while `$.text()` is a method that returns the text content of an element.

DONE.
