  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.transform
```
This would result in different behavior because `AttributeMap.transform` is a different method from `AttributeMap.invert`, and it may produce a different output for the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.transform
```
This would result in different behavior because `Delta.transform` is a different method from `AttributeMap.invert`, and it may produce a different output for the same input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.compose
```
This would result in different behavior because `AttributeMap.compose` is a different method from `AttributeMap.invert`, and it may produce a different output for the same input.

DONE.
