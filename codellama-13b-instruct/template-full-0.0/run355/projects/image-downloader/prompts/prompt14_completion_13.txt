  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basename.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `basename` variable is converted to uppercase, which could cause issues if the original code relied on the case of the filename.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basename.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `basename` variable is converted to lowercase, which could cause issues if the original code relied on the case of the filename.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basename.replace(/[^\w\s]/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `basename` variable is modified to remove any non-word and non-space characters, which could cause issues if the original code relied on the presence of certain characters in the filename.

DONE.
