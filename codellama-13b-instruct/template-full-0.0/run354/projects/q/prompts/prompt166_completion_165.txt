  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the decrement operator `--` would cause the loop to iterate one less time than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the increment operator `+=` would cause the loop to iterate two more times than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i *= 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operator `*=` would cause the loop to iterate twice as many times as the original code.

DONE.
