  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would return a different array, which would cause the `dispatch` method to be called with a different set of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would return a different array, which would cause the `dispatch` method to be called with a different set of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would return a different array, which would cause the `dispatch` method to be called with a different set of arguments.

DONE.
