  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.noConflict()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.noConflict()` returns a reference to the `Q` object, which is not the same as the original code fragment `Q`. This would cause the `Q` object to be returned instead of the `Q` function, which would result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nbind(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nbind()` returns a function that wraps the provided function in a `Q` object, which is not the same as the original code fragment `Q`. This would cause the wrapped function to be returned instead of the `Q` function, which would result in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.ninvoke(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.ninvoke()` returns a promise that resolves to the result of the provided function, which is
