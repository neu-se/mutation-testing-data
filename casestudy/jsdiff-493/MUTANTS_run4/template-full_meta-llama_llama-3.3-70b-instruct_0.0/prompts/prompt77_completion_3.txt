Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
obj[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the object has the property specified by the `key` variable, but the replacement checks if the object has a property with the name equal to the value of the property specified by the `key` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'key'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the object has the property specified by the `key` variable, but the replacement always checks for a property named 'key', regardless of the actual key being processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
sortedKeys[i]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the object has the property specified by the `key` variable, but the replacement checks if the object has a property with the name equal to the current sorted key being processed, which could be different from the original key due to sorting.

DONE.
