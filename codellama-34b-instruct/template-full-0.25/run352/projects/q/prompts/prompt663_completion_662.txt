  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would start at the third argument instead of the second, potentially including additional arguments that were not intended to be included in the `post` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would only include the first two arguments in the `post` method, potentially excluding important arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 1, -1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would include all arguments except the last one in the `post` method, potentially excluding important arguments.

DONE.
