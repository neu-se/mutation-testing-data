  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise, message[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `message` variable is an array, and `message[0]` would be the first element of the array, whereas `message` would be the entire array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise, message.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `message.slice(1)` would return a new array containing all elements of `message` except the first, whereas `message` would return the entire array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise, message.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `message.pop()` would remove and return the last element of `message`, whereas `message` would return the entire array.

DONE.
