  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']() || this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `div` function to return `Complex['INFINITY']` when `this['isZero']()` is true, instead of `Complex['ZERO']` as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `div` function to return `Complex['NAN']` when `this['isInfinite']()` is true and `z['isZero']()` is true, instead of `Complex['INFINITY']` as in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']() && this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `div` function to return `Complex['N
