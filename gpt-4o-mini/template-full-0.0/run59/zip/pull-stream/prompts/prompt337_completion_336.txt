Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (e) { return e + 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the way the field is processed, causing the unique function to treat values as unique based on their incremented value rather than their original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (e) { return e.length }
```
This would result in different behavior because it alters the uniqueness check to be based on the length of the data instead of the actual data itself, potentially leading to incorrect filtering of unique items.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it effectively removes the field processing, causing the unique function to always return true for all items, thus failing to filter out duplicates as intended.

DONE.
