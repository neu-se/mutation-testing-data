Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the focus from the entire operation object to only the `insert` property, potentially leading to incorrect length calculations when the operation does not have an `insert` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would count the length based on the `retain` property instead of the entire operation, which may not accurately reflect the total length of the operations if `retain` is not present or is not the intended property to measure.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a length of zero, disregarding any actual operations in the `ops` array, leading to incorrect results in any context where the length of operations is relevant.

DONE.
