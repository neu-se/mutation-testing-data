  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the index is greater than 0, which means it will only execute the code inside the if statement if the index is greater than 0. However, if we replace the code fragment with `index < 0`, it will execute the code inside the if statement if the index is less than 0, which is the opposite behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the index is greater than 0, which means it will only execute the code inside the if statement if the index is greater than 0. However, if we replace the code fragment with `index === 0`, it will execute the code inside the if statement if the index is equal to 0, which is a different condition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the
