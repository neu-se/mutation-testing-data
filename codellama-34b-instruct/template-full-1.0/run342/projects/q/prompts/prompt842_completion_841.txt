  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Q.timeout(object, "1000")```
This would result in different behavior because the timeout value would be a string instead of a number, which would cause the function to throw a type error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Q.timeout(object, null)```
This would result in different behavior because the timeout value would be null instead of a number, which would cause the function to throw a type error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Q.timeout(object, {})```
This would result in different behavior because the timeout value would be an object instead of a number, which would cause the function to throw a type error.

DONE.
