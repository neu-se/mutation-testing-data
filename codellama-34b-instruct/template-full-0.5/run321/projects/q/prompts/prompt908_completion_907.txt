  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the arguments from the 2nd index instead of the 1st index, which could potentially change the behavior of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the arguments from the 1st index to the 2nd index, which could potentially change the behavior of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the arguments from the 0th index to the 1st index, which could potentially change the behavior of the function.

DONE.
