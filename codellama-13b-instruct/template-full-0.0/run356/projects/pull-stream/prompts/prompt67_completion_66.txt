  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && end !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `end` is truthy and not equal to `true`, while the buggy code fragment checks if `end` is truthy and not equal to `true` or `false`. This would cause the code to behave differently in certain edge cases, such as when `end` is `null` or `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `end` is truthy and not equal to `true`, while the buggy code fragment checks if `end` is not equal to `true`.
