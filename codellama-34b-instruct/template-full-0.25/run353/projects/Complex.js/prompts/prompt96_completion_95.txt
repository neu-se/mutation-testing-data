  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parser_exit` function would be called with an argument of `1`, which would cause it to exit the program with a non-zero status code, indicating an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parser_exit` function would be called with an argument of `0`, which would cause it to exit the program with a zero status code, indicating success.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parser_exit` function would be called with an argument of `2`, which would cause it to exit the program with a status code of `2`, indicating an error.

DONE.
