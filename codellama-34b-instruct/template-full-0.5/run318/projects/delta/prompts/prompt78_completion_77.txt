  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.delete === 'number' &&
        typeof lastOp.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would check if the `delete` property of `newOp` is a number and the `retain` property of `lastOp` is a number, whereas the original code checks if both `delete` properties are numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.delete === 'string' &&
        typeof lastOp.delete === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would check if the `delete` property of `newOp` is a string and the `delete` property of `lastOp` is a string, whereas the original code checks if both `delete` properties are numbers.
