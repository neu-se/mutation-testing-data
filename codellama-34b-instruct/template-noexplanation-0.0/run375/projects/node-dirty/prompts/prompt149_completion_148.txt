  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb of cbs.reverse()
```
This change will cause the callbacks to be called in reverse order, which may cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses the `Dirty` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb of cbs.slice(1)
```
This change will cause the callbacks to be called starting from the second element in the `cbs` array, which may cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses the `Dirty` class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb of cbs.filter(cb => cb !== cbs[0])
```
This change will cause the callbacks to be called only if they are not the first element in the `cbs` array, which may cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses the `Dirty` class.

DONE.
