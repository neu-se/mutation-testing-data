 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
delta.ops = delta.ops.concat(other.ops.slice(1));
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly modifies the `delta.ops` array, bypassing the creation of a new `Delta` object. This could lead to unexpected side effects if the `Delta` object is used elsewhere in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
delta.ops.push(...other.ops.slice(1));
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the spread operator (`...`) to add the remaining elements of `other.ops` to `delta.ops`. This could change the original structure of the `delta.ops` array, potentially causing issues if the code relies on the original structure.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
delta.ops = delta.ops.concat(other.ops);
```
This would result in different behavior because it concatenates
