  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new array with the same elements as the original array, rather than a shallow copy of the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new array with all but the first element of the original array, rather than a shallow copy of the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new array with all but the first two elements of the original array, rather than a shallow copy of the original array.

DONE.
