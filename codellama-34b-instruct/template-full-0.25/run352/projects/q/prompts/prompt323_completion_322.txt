  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise, args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` array is not being passed to the `promiseDispatch` function, which could cause issues with the function's behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise, args[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` array is not being passed to the `promiseDispatch` function, which could cause issues with the function's behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise, args[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` array is not being passed to the `promiseDispatch` function, which could cause issues with the function's behavior.

DONE.
