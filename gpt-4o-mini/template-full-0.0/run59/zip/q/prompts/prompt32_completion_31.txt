Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(function () { task(); }, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces an additional delay before executing the task, which could lead to different timing issues or race conditions compared to the original synchronous execution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
runSingle(null, domain);
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to run a `null` task, which would throw an error, whereas the original code executes the intended task function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
runSingle(task, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes `null` as the domain, which may affect the execution context and error handling, potentially leading to uncaught exceptions that would not occur with the original code.

DONE.
