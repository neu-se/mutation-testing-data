  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `cb` function with `true` as an argument, while this replacement calls it with `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `cb` function with `true` as an argument, while this replacement calls it with `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(array[i++])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `cb` function with `true` as an argument, while this replacement calls it with the next element in the `array` variable.

DONE.
