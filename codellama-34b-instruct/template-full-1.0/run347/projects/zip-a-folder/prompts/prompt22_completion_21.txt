  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!zipAFolderOptions && !zipAFolderOptions.customWriteStream
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the condition, so the code fragment would only be true when `zipAFolderOptions` is falsy and `customWriteStream` is defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions || !zipAFolderOptions.customWriteStream
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator checks if either `zipAFolderOptions` or `customWriteStream` is truthy, so the code fragment would be true even if `zipAFolderOptions` is falsy and `customWriteStream` is defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof zipAFolderOptions.customWriteStream === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator checks the type of `customWriteStream`, so the code fragment would be true if `customWriteStream` is undefined
