  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because peek() returns the next operation without advancing the iterator, so the next call to next() would return the same operation, potentially causing an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek().value
```
This would result in different behavior because peek().value returns the value of the next operation, which may not be the same as the next operation itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek().operations
```
This would result in different behavior because peek().operations returns an array of all operations in the next iteration, rather than just the next operation.

DONE.
