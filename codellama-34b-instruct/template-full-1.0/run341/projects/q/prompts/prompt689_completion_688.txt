  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"eval"
```
This would result in different behavior because `eval` is a built-in JavaScript function that evaluates a string as JavaScript code, whereas `"apply"` is a method on the `Function` prototype that applies a `this` context and an array of arguments to a function. Using `"eval"` instead of `"apply"` would cause the function to be evaluated as a string, which could have unintended consequences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"typeof"
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` is a built-in JavaScript operator that returns the type of a variable or value, whereas `"apply"` is a method on the `Function` prototype that applies a `this` context and an array of arguments to a function. Using `"typeof"` instead of `"apply"` would cause the function to be evaluated as a type, which would result in a different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call"
```
This would result in different behavior
