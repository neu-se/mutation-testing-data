  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would cause the `eachLine` method to iterate over the lines of the delta, while `0` would cause the method to return immediately without iterating over any lines.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would cause the `eachLine` method to iterate over the lines of the delta, while `-1` would cause the method to iterate over the lines of the delta in reverse order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would cause the `eachLine` method to iterate over the lines of the delta, while `2` would cause the method to iterate over the lines of the delta twice.

DONE.
