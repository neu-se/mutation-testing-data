  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr == ""
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider an empty string to be falsy, whereas the original code fragment would consider it to be truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof rowStr === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the variable `rowStr` is undefined, whereas the original code fragment would only check if it evaluates to a falsy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the variable `rowStr` is not null, whereas the original code fragment would only check if it evaluates to a truthy value.

DONE.
