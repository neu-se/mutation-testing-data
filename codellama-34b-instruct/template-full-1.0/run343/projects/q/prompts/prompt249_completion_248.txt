  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.lastIndexOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastIndexOf()` returns the index of the last occurrence of the specified value, whereas `indexOf()` returns the index of the first occurrence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it reverses the stack trace string before finding the index of the specified value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the length of the stack trace string, which may be different from the index of the specified value.

DONE.
