  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._load()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, while the new code fragment is a function call with parentheses. This could potentially cause different behavior if the function being called has side effects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._load
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, while the new code fragment is a reference to the function. This could potentially cause different behavior if the function being referenced is not called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._load.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, while the new code fragment is a function call with the `bind` method. This could potentially cause different behavior if the function being called has side effects.

DONE.
