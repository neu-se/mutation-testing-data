  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.R_OK & fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the bitwise AND operator (`&`) would be used instead of the bitwise OR operator (`|`), which would cause the code to check if the file has both read and write permissions instead of either read or write permissions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.R_OK ^ fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the bitwise XOR operator (`^`) would be used instead of the bitwise OR operator (`|`), which would cause the code to check if the file has read and write permissions but not both.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.R_OK + fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition operator (`+`) would be used instead of the bitwise OR operator (`|`), which would cause the code
