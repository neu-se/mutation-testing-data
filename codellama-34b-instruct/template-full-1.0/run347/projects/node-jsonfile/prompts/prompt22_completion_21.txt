  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(content)
```
This would result in a different behavior because `JSON.stringify` would convert the JSON object to a string, whereas `stripBom` would remove any Byte Order Mark (BOM) characters from the beginning of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(content, null)
```
This would result in a different behavior because `JSON.parse` would convert the JSON string to a JavaScript object, whereas `stripBom` would remove any BOM characters from the beginning of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content
```
This would result in a different behavior because `content` would refer to the original JSON string, whereas `stripBom` would remove any BOM characters from the beginning of the string.

DONE.
