  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof options !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the original condition, so the function would only execute the code in the `if` block when `options` is not a string, rather than when it is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'throws' in options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `'throws'` property is present in the `options` object, rather than checking if the type of `options` is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the length of the `options` object is greater than 0, rather than checking if the type of `options` is a string.

DONE.
