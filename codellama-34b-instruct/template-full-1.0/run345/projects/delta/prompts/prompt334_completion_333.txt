  
As an expert in mutation testing, I have analyzed the code fragment you provided and have identified three possible code fragments that can be used to replace the `PLACEHOLDER` in the original code. Each of these code fragments has different behavior than the original code and could potentially reveal weaknesses in the project's test suite.

Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with `1 + baseOp.attributes`.
This would result in different behavior because the value of `1 + baseOp.attributes` would always be greater than `baseOp.attributes`, which would cause the `OpIterator` to skip over certain iterations and potentially skip over bugs that should have been caught by the test suite.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with `baseOp.attributes + 2`.
This would result in different behavior because adding 2 to `baseOp.attributes` would cause the `OpIterator` to iterate over extra iterations, potentially leading to errors or crashes that would go undetected by the test suite.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with
