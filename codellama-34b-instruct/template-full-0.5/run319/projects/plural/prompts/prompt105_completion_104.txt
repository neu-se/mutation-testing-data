  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only returned the word unchanged if it was one of the specified words, while this new code fragment would return the word with an 'es' added to the end if it was one of the specified words.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only returned the word unchanged if it was one of the specified words, while this new code fragment would return the word with an 's' added to the end if it was one of the specified words.
