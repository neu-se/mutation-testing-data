  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return `false` instead of `true`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` and the `cb` function to be called with `null` instead of `i++`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < max
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return `i < max` instead of `i > max`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if `i` is less than `max` instead of greater than `max`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i++ < max
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return `i++ < max` instead of `i > max`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if `i` is less than `max` instead of greater than `max`.

DONE.
