  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(fulfill(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill` is not a function, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(reject(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is not a function, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(Q(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(value)` would create a new promise that is not the same as the original promise, and would cause the `become` function to behave differently.

DONE.
