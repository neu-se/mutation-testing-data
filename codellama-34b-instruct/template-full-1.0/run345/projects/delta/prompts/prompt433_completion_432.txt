  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  Op.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would change the result of the expression, potentially leading to incorrect operations in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  Op.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would change the result of the expression, potentially leading to incorrect operations in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  2 * Op.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` 2 would change the result of the expression, potentially leading to incorrect operations in the code.

DONE.
