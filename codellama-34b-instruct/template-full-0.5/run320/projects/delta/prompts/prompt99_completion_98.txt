  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index, 0, newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `splice` method to insert the `newOp` object at the beginning of the `ops` array, rather than at the end.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index, 1, newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `splice` method to insert the `newOp` object at the second index of the `ops` array, rather than at the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index, 0, newOp, newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `splice` method to insert two copies of the `newOp` object at the beginning of the `ops` array, rather than just one.

DONE.
