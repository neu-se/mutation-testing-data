  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `im` property is the imaginary part of the complex number, whereas the `re` property is the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the real part of the complex number, which would change the result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the imaginary part of the complex number, which would change the result of the calculation.

DONE.
