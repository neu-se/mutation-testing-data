  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `true`, which would always evaluate to `true` and call the `cb` function with `null` as the first argument, while the new code fragment would evaluate to `false` and call the `cb` function with `undefined` as the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null

This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `true`, which would always evaluate to `true` and call the `cb` function with `null` as the first argument, while the new code fragment would evaluate to `null` and call the `cb` function with `null` as the first argument.
