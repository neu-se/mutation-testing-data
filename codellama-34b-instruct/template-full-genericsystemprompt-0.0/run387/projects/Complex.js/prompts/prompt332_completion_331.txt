  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is equal to 1, while this replacement checks if `b` is equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is equal to 1, while this replacement checks if `a` is equal to 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is equal to 1, while this replacement checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is equal to 1.

DONE.
