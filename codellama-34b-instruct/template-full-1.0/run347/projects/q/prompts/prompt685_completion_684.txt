  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments[1])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `array_slice` on the second argument of the function, rather than the arguments object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only include the first argument of the function in the returned slice.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude the first argument of the function from the returned slice.

DONE.
