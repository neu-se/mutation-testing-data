  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiverOptions || { gzip: false }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would disable gzip compression, which is enabled by default in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiverOptions && { gzip: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always enable gzip compression, regardless of the value of `archiverOptions`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiverOptions ? { gzip: true } : { gzip: false }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would enable gzip compression only if `archiverOptions` is truthy, and disable it otherwise.

DONE.
