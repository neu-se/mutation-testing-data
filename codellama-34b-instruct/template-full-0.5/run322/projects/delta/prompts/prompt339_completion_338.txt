  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the slice method to start from the previous index instead of the current index, which could lead to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the slice method to start from two indices ahead of the current index, which could lead to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the slice method to start from twice the current index, which could lead to incorrect results.

DONE.
