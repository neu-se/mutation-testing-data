  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `deferred.resolve` would cause it to be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` would cause the promise to be notified, whereas `deferred.resolve` would cause it to be resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` would cause the promise to be resolved with a value of `null`, whereas `deferred.resolve` would cause it to be resolved with the value of `value`.

DONE.
