  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the op would be incremented by 1, which could cause the slice function to include an extra element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the op would be decremented by 1, which could cause the slice function to omit an element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the ops array would be used instead of the length of the current op, which could cause the slice function to behave differently.

DONE.
