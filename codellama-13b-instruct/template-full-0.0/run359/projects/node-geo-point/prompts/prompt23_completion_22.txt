  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'longitude'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking for the presence of the `longitude` property instead of the `latitude` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'latitude'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking for the presence of the `latitude` property instead of the `longitude` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'type'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking for the presence of the `type` property instead of the `latitude` or `longitude` properties.

DONE.
