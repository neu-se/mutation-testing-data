  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the contents of the `src` directory in the archive, whereas the original code fragment only includes the directory itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, false, 'utf8'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the contents of the `src` directory in the archive, whereas the original code fragment only includes the directory itself. Additionally, it would use the `utf8` encoding for the archive, whereas the original code fragment uses the default encoding.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, false, 'binary'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the contents of the `src` directory in the archive, whereas the original code fragment only includes the directory itself. Additionally, it would use the `binary` encoding for the archive, whereas the original code fragment uses the default encoding.

DONE.
