  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan()` would return the tangent of the angle in radians, while `Math.cos()` would return the cosine of the angle in radians.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin() * Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin() * Math.PI` would return the sine of the angle in radians multiplied by pi, while `Math.cos()` would return the cosine of the angle in radians.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(Math.pow(Math.PI, 2) / 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt(Math.pow(Math.PI, 2) / 2)` would return the square root of the square of pi divided by 2, while `Math.cos()` would return the cosine of the angle in radians
