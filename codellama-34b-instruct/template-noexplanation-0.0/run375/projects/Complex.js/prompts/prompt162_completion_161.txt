  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNaN']
```
This code fragment checks if the complex number `z` is not a number (NaN), which is different from the original code fragment that checks if `z` is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']
```
This code fragment checks if the complex number `z` is zero, which is different from the original code fragment that checks if `z` is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite'] && z['re'] < 0
```
This code fragment checks if the complex number `z` is infinite and its real part is less than zero, which is different from the original code fragment that checks if `z` is infinite.

DONE.
