  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would be called with the `"set"` operation instead of the `"get"` operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"length"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of the `object` argument would be returned instead of the value of the property specified by the `key` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"valueOf"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `valueOf` method of the `object` argument would be called instead of getting the value of the property specified by the `key` argument.

DONE.
