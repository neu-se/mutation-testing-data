  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    delete object.hasOwnProperty;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` method would be deleted from the object, which could cause unexpected issues if it is used later in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    object.hasOwnProperty = function() { return false; };
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` method would always return `false`, even if the object does have the property. This could cause unexpected issues if the code is relying on the correct behavior of the `hasOwnProperty` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    object.hasOwnProperty = function(property) { return !object.hasProperty(property); };
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` method would be overwritten to return the opposite of what the original method would return. This could cause unexpected issues if the code is relying on the
