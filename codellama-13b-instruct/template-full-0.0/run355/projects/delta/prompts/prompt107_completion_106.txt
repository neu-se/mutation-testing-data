  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.map(op => op.insert)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the `insert` property of each `Op` object in the `ops` array, rather than the entire `Op` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.map(op => op.retain)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the `retain` property of each `Op` object in the `ops` array, rather than the entire `Op` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.map(op => op.delete)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the `delete` property of each `Op` object in the `ops` array, rather than the entire `Op` object.

DONE.
