Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'data-href'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the attribute being accessed from the standard 'href' to a non-standard 'data-href', which may not exist on the anchor elements, leading to potential undefined behavior or missing URLs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'link'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the attribute being accessed from 'href' to 'link', which is not a standard attribute for anchor elements, likely resulting in incorrect or missing URL extraction.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'href2'
```
This would result in different behavior because it refers to a non-existent attribute 'href2', which will always return undefined, causing the subsequent URL parsing logic to fail or behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
