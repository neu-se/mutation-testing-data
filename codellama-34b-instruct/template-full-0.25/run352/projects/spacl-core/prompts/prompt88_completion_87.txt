  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.filter(policy => policy.name !== null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method would remove any policies with a `null` name, whereas the original code would include them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.map(policy => policy.name)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` method would return an array of policy names, whereas the original code would return an array of policies.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.reduce((acc, policy) => acc + policy.name, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce` method would concatenate the policy names into a single string, whereas the original code would return an array of policies.

DONE.
