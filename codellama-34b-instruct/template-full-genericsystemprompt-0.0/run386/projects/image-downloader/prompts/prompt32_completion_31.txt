  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode === 404
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for a non-200 status code, while this new code fragment checks for a 404 status code specifically.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode < 200
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for a non-200 status code, while this new code fragment checks for any status code less than 200.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode > 299
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for a non-200 status code, while this new code fragment checks for any status code greater than 299.

DONE.
