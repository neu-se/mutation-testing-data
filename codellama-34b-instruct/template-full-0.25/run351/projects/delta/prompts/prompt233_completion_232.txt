  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherIter.next(opLength));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the next operation from the other iterator, which may not be the correct operation to push in the current context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(thisIter.next(opLength));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the next operation from the this iterator, which may not be the correct operation to push in the current context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherIter.next(opLength + 1));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the next operation from the other iterator, but with an increased length, which may not be the correct operation to push in the current context.

DONE.
