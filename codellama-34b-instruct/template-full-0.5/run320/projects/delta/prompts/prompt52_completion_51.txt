  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function would not throw an error if `b` is not an object or null, but instead would return `[null, null, null]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function would not throw an error if `c` is not an object or null, but instead would return `[null, null, null]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function would throw an error if `null` is passed in as an argument, but the code would not handle the error properly.

DONE.
