  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.attributes === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `newOp.attributes` is an object, but the replaced code checks if it is a string. This could cause the `push` method to behave differently if `newOp.attributes` is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.attributes === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `newOp.attributes` is an object, but the replaced code checks if it is a number. This could cause the `push` method to behave differently if `newOp.attributes` is a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.attributes === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `newOp.attributes` is an object, but the replaced code checks if it is undefined. This could cause the `push` method to behave differently if `
