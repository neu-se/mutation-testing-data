  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would not be called with a fulfilled promise, and the `catch` method would not be called with a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would not be called with a fulfilled promise, and the `catch` method would not be called with a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would not be called with a fulfilled promise, and the `catch` method would not be called with a rejected promise.

DONE.
