  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = i + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip every other iteration, potentially missing important side effects or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i -= 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never terminate, causing an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i *= 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate twice as many times as it should, potentially leading to unexpected results or errors.

DONE.
