 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'random_string'
```
This would result in different behavior because a constant string is used instead of the policy name, causing incorrect policy lookups.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because a random number is used instead of the policy name, causing unpredictable policy lookups.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
(<any>policy).someRandomProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because a random property is accessed on the policy object, causing unexpected results or errors.

DONE.
