  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] = { current: [], all: [] };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always create a new object for the `result[country]` property, even if one already existed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] = { current: result[country].current, all: result[country].all };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always create a new object for the `result[country]` property, even if one already existed, and it would also copy the `current` and `all` properties from the existing object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] = { current: result[country].current.slice(), all: result[country].all.slice() };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always create a new object for the `result[country]` property, even if one already existed, and it would also copy the `current` and `all` properties
