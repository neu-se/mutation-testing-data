  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all` returns a promise that resolves when all of the promises in the input array have resolved, whereas `Q.race` returns a promise that resolves or rejects as soon as one of the promises in the input array resolves or rejects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` returns a promise that is rejected with the given reason, whereas `Q.race` returns a promise that resolves or rejects based on the outcome of the promises in the input array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` returns a promise that is resolved with the given value, whereas `Q.race` returns a promise that resolves or rejects based on the outcome of the promises in the input array.

DONE.
