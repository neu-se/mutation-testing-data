  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [key]: tzs[key] + 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment assigned the value of `tzs[key]` to the property with the same key in the new object, while this modified code fragment assigns the value of `tzs[key] + 1` to the property with the same key in the new object. This means that the resulting object will have different property values than the original object, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses the resulting object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [key]: tzs[key] - 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment assigned the value of `tzs[key]` to the property with the same key in the new object, while this modified code fragment assigns the value of `tzs[key] - 1` to the property with the same key in the new object. This means that the resulting object will have different property values than the original object
