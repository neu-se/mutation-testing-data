Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry(id, options) || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an empty object if `getCountry` returns `null`, instead of the expected country object or `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry(id, {}) // passing an empty object instead of options
```
This would result in different behavior because it ignores any options that might be passed in, potentially affecting the returned country object if the options are relevant for the `getCountry` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry(id, { deprecated: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the `getCountry` function to treat the country as deprecated, which may alter the returned data structure or content based on the `deliverCountry` function's logic.

DONE.
