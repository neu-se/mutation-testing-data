 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"toString"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_keys` function would now include the `toString` method as a key of the object being inspected, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_hasOwnProperty` check would fail for any keys in the object, causing the `object_keys` function to return an empty array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_hasOwnProperty` check would now be checking if the object has a property with the name of the number `1`, rather than checking if the object has its own property. This would likely cause the `object_keys` function to return an empty array.

DONE.
