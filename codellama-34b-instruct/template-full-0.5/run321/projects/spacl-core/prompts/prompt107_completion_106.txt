  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring` method returns a new string that is a subset of the original string, starting from the specified index. In this case, it would return the string without the first character, which could cause the `matches` method to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase` method returns a new string that is the original string converted to uppercase. In this case, it could cause the `matches` method to return a different result if the policy name is case-sensitive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method returns an array of strings by splitting the original string at the specified separator. In this case, it could cause the `matches` method to return a different result if the policy name contains a '/
