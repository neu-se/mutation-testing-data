  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.call(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `Array.prototype.slice` is a method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments` is an array-like object that is not a true array, while `Array.prototype.slice` is a method that can be called on a true array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[].slice.call(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `[].slice` is a method that can be called on a true array, while `arguments` is an array-like object that is not a true array.

DONE.
