  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest, basename
```
This would result in different behavior because `basename` is the original filename without the extension, while `decodedBasename` is the decoded version of the filename with the extension. Using `basename` instead of `decodedBasename` would result in a different filename being used for the destination path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest, pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because `pathname` is the original path without the filename, while `decodedBasename` is the decoded version of the filename with the extension. Using `pathname` instead of `decodedBasename` would result in a different filename being used for the destination path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest, url.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because `url.pathname` is the original path without the filename, while `decodedBasename` is the decoded version of
