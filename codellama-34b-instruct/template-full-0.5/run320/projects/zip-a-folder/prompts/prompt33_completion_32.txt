  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function would be called instead of the `reject` function, which would cause the promise to resolve instead of rejecting.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('some error')
```
This would result in different behavior because an error would be thrown instead of the `reject` function being called, which would cause the promise to reject with a different error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.on('error', () => {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `on` method would be called with a different callback function, which would cause the promise to resolve instead of rejecting when an error occurs.

DONE.
