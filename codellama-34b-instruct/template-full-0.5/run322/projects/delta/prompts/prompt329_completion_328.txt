  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain || op.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator will return `true` if either `op.retain` or `op.attributes` is truthy, whereas the `&&` operator would only return `true` if both are truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain ? op.attributes : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the ternary operator would return `op.attributes` if `op.retain` is truthy, and `null` otherwise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain && op.attributes.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional check on `op.attributes.length` would ensure that the `retain` operation is only applied if `op.attributes` is a non-empty array.

DONE.
