  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `parse1` is not defined, and an error would be thrown when it is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse.join
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `parse.join` is not defined, and an error would be thrown when it is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse.fake()
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `parse.fake()` is not defined, and an error would be thrown when it is called.

DONE.
