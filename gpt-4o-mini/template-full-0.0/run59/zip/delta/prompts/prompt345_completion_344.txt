Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.transform
```
This would result in different behavior because `transform` is intended to modify the data rather than invert it, leading to incorrect handling of the attributes during the operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.invertAttributes
```
This would result in different behavior because `invertAttributes` suggests a different function that may not exist or may not perform the intended inversion of attributes, potentially causing unexpected results in the final output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.process
```
This would result in different behavior because `process` is a generic term that does not imply any specific operation related to inversion, which could lead to a complete failure in handling the data as expected.

DONE.
