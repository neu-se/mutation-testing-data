  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(θ) + 360
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add 360 degrees to the bearing, which would cause the calculated destination point to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(θ) - 360
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always subtract 360 degrees from the bearing, which would cause the calculated destination point to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(θ) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the bearing, which would cause the calculated destination point to be incorrect.

DONE.
