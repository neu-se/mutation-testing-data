  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return the value of the promise, while the replaced code fragment would return null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return the value of the promise, while the replaced code fragment would return undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return the value of the promise, while the replaced code fragment would return 0.

DONE.
