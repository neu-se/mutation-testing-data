  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'base' + 'link'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only selects the "base" element, while the modified code fragment selects the "base" element and the "link" element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'base' + 'link' + 'anchor'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only selects the "base" element, while the modified code fragment selects the "base" element, the "link" element, and the "anchor" element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'base' + 'link' + 'anchor' + 'img'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only selects the "base" element, while the modified code fragment selects the "base" element, the "link" element, the "anchor" element, and the "img" element.

DONE.
