  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p.source.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because `p.source.stack` would reference the stack property of the source promise, which may not be the same as the stack property of the current promise `p`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p.stack + " " + promise.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the stack property of the current promise `p` with the stack property of `promise`, effectively combining their stack traces.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reference the stack property of `promise`, which may not be the same as the stack property of the current promise `p`.

DONE.
