  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw e;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws the error synchronously, while the mutated code fragment throws the error asynchronously using `setTimeout`. This could potentially change the timing of when the error is thrown and how it is handled by the surrounding code.
