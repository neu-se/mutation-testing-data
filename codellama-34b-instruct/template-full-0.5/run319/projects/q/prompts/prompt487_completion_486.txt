  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.splice(at, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment also removes the corresponding reason from the `unhandledReasons` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.splice(at, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment also removes the corresponding rejection from the `unhandledRejections` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.splice(atReport, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment also removes the corresponding reason from the `unhandledReasons` array.

DONE.
