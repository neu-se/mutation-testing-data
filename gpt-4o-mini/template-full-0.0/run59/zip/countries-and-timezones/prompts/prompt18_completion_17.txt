Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].all.push(id + '1');
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends an altered version of the `id` (with '1' concatenated) to the `all` array instead of the original `id`, leading to incorrect data being stored.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].all.unshift(id);
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `unshift` instead of `push`, which adds the `id` to the beginning of the `all` array instead of the end, changing the order of the elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].all = result[country].all.slice(0, -1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `all` array with a new array that excludes the last element, effectively removing data instead of adding to it.

DONE.
