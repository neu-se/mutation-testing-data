  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return 42;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a function that takes no arguments, while this modified code fragment returns the number 42.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Oops!");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a function that takes no arguments, while this modified code fragment throws an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return function () { return 42; };
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a function that takes no arguments, while this modified code fragment returns a function that returns the number 42.

DONE.
