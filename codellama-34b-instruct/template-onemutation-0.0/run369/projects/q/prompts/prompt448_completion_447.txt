  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.push
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the reason for the rejection onto the `unhandledReasons` array instead of the `unhandledRejections` array, which would cause the rejection to be tracked incorrectly.

DONE.
