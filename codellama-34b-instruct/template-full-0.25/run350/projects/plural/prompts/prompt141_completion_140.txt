  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word, rule[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rule[1]` variable is a function that is not called in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word, rule[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rule[2]` variable is not defined in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word, rule[0].test(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rule[0].test(word)` expression is not evaluated in the original code fragment.

DONE.
