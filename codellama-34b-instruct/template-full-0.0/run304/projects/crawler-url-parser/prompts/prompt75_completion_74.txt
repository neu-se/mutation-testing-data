  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'base' + 'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is looking for an attribute called "base" on the current element, while the modified code fragment is looking for an attribute called "basea".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'base' + 'b'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is looking for an attribute called "base" on the current element, while the modified code fragment is looking for an attribute called "baseb".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'base' + 'c'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is looking for an attribute called "base" on the current element, while the modified code fragment is looking for an attribute called "basec".

DONE.
