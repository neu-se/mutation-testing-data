 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / a
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the behavior when `a` is 0, making it undefined instead of throwing an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a potential overflow issue when `a` is very large.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re'] * this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it only considers the real part of the complex number, ignoring the imaginary part.

DONE.
