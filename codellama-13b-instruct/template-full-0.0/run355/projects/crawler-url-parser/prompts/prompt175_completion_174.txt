  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function is not defined in the code snippet provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url
```
This would result in different behavior because the `url` variable is not defined in the code snippet provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-window-manager"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string literal `"https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-window-manager"` is not the same as the `url` variable in the code snippet provided.

DONE.
