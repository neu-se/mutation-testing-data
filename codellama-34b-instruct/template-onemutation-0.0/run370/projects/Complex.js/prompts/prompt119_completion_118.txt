  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['abs'](this['re'] + this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the absolute value of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, which would give a different result than the original code fragment that only calculates the absolute value of the real part.

DONE.
