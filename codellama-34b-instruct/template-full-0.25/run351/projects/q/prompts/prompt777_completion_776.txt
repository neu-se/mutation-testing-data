  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect.then(function (result) {
    return result.value;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the promise, rather than the promise itself, which is what the original code fragment does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect.then(function (result) {
    return result.reason;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the reason for the promise's rejection, rather than the promise itself, which is what the original code fragment does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect.then(function (result) {
    return result.state;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the state of the promise, rather than the promise itself, which is what the original code fragment does.

DONE.
