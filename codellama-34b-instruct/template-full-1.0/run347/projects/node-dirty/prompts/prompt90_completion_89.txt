  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the key from the database instead of emitting an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately emit the 'drain' event instead of waiting for the writes to complete.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.delete(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the key from the queue instead of emitting an error, which would cause the key to be permanently lost.

DONE.
