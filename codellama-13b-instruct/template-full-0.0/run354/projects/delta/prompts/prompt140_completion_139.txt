  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[index - 1] = { retain: lastOp.retain + newOp.retain };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `retain` property of the previous operation to be overwritten with the `retain` property of the new operation, rather than being added to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[index - 1].retain += newOp.retain;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `retain` property of the previous operation to be incremented by the `retain` property of the new operation, rather than being overwritten with it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[index - 1].retain = lastOp.retain + newOp.retain;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `retain` property of the previous operation to be set to the sum of its
