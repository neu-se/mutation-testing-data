 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.fapply
```
This would result in different behavior because `fapply` directly applies the given arguments to the target function, bypassing the promise behavior. This could cause issues if the target function is asynchronous or has side effects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.thenApply
```
This would result in different behavior because `thenApply` expects a function to be passed as the first argument, which is then applied to the promise value. By passing `nodeArgs` directly, you would bypass the function and pass the arguments as the promise value, causing unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.all
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` expects an array of promises as its argument, not a function and an array. This would cause the code to break, as the `all` method would not be able to handle the provided arguments correctly.

DONE.
