Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the number of stack traces instead of the concatenated stack trace strings, leading to a loss of detailed error information.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.join(", ")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the stack traces with a comma and space instead of a newline and separator, making the output less readable and potentially confusing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.reverse().join("\n" + STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR + "\n")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the stack traces before concatenating them, which could mislead developers about the sequence of events leading to the error.

DONE.
