  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof href == "undefined" || href.length < 3 || /^(javascript|mailto:|ftp:)/ig.test(href)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the href attribute is undefined, has a length less than 3, or matches the regular expression `/^(javascript|mailto:|ftp:)/ig`. The modified code fragment would also check if the href attribute is undefined, has a length less than 3, or matches the regular expression `/^(javascript|mailto:|ftp:)/ig`, but it would also check if the href attribute is null.
