 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.createReadStream(this.path, {encoding: 'utf-8', flags: 'r'})
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new read stream every time `close()` is called, which may cause data loss or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prevent the read stream from being destroyed, potentially causing a resource leak.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._readStream || fs.createReadStream(this.path, {encoding: 'utf-8', flags: 'r'})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only create a new read stream if `_readStream` is not defined, but it would not destroy the existing read stream, potentially causing a resource leak.

DONE.
