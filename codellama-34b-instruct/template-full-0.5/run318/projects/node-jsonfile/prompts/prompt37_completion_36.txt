  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, str, options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.encoding` is not the same as `options`, and it may cause the function to behave differently, such as reading a file with a different encoding.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, str, options.throws
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.throws` is a boolean value that indicates whether the function should throw an error if the file cannot be read. If it is set to `false`, the function may not throw an error, which could cause it to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, str, options.fs
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.fs` is a reference to a file system object, and it may cause the function to behave differently, such as reading a file from a different location.

DONE.
