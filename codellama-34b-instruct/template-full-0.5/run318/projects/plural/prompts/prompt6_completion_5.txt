  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString.call()` is a method that returns a string representing the object, while `obj.toString()` is a method that returns a string representing the object's value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString.call()` is a method that returns a string representing the object, while `obj.valueOf()` is a method that returns the object's value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.toLocaleString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString.call()` is a method that returns a string representing the object, while `obj.toLocaleString()` is a method that returns a string representing the object's value in the current locale.

DONE.
