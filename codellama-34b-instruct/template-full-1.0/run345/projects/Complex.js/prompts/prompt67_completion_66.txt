  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.slice(0, 2) === 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` returns a new array, rather than mutating the existing one, so the comparison would always fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.replace(/2/g, '') === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because `replace` returns a new string, rather than mutating the existing one, so the comparison would always fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.indexOf('2') === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` returns -1 when the searched item is not found, so the comparison would always succeed.

DONE.
