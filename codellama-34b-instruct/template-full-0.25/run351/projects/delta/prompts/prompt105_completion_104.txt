  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.forEach(op => op.attributes = {});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the attributes of each operation in the ops array, which is not the intended behavior of the forEach method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.forEach(op => op.delete = 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the delete property of each operation in the ops array to 0, which would cause the delete method to not delete any elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.forEach(op => op.retain = 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the retain property of each operation in the ops array to 0, which would cause the retain method to not retain any elements.

DONE.
