  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.has(name)
```
This would result in different behavior because `has()` checks for the existence of a key, while `get()` retrieves the value associated with that key. In the original code, `get()` is used to retrieve a `Policy` object from the map, but if `has()` is used instead, a boolean value indicating whether the key exists in the map would be returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(name, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `set()` sets the value associated with a key, while `get()` retrieves the value. If `set()` is used with `undefined` as the value, it would store `undefined` as the value associated with the key, while `get()` would retrieve the previous value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.delete(name)
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete()` deletes a key-value pair from the map,
