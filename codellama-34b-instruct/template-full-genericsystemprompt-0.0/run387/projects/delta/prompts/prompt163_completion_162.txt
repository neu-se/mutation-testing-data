  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to move one step further than it should, potentially skipping over an important operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to move one step backward than it should, potentially missing an important operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length * 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to move twice as far as it should, potentially skipping over multiple important operations.

DONE.
