  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file + '.' + options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `file` variable directly, while this replacement uses the `file` variable with an additional string concatenation with the `options.encoding` property. This could cause the file to be written to a different location or with a different name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `file` variable directly, while this replacement uses the `file` variable with a slice operation that removes the last character. This could cause the file to be written to a different location or with a different name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `file` variable directly, while this replacement uses the `file` variable with a `toUpperCase()` method call. This could cause the file to be
