  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort
```
This would result in different behavior because `abort` is a boolean variable that indicates whether the stream should be aborted, whereas `read` is a function that reads data from the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.log` is a function that logs a message to the console, whereas `read` is a function that reads data from the stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Sink
```
This would result in different behavior because `Sink` is a class that represents a sink in the stream, whereas `read` is a function that reads data from the stream.

DONE.
