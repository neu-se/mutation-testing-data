  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.dispatch
```
This would result in an infinite loop because `Q.dispatch` calls the `dispatch` method on the `Q` object, which is the same object that the `Q.dispatch` method is defined on, causing the method to be called recursively without making any progress.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch
```
This would result in an error because `this` refers to the `Promise.prototype` object, which does not have a `dispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null.dispatch
```
This would result in an error because `null` is not an object and does not have any properties or methods, including `dispatch`.

DONE.
