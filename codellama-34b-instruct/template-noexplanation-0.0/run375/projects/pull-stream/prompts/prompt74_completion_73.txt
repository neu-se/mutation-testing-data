  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && true
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if `abort` is `false`. This will result in the `read` function being called with `abort` set to `true`, which may cause the function to behave differently than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if `abort` is `true`. This will result in the `read` function being called with `abort` set to `false`, which may cause the function to behave differently than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort ? true : false
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` if `abort` is `true`, and `false` if `abort` is `false`. This will result in the `read` function being called with `abort
