  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.timeout` expects a promise as its first argument, but `null` is not a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.timeout` expects a promise as its first argument, but `undefined` is not a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject("error")
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.timeout` expects a promise that resolves, but `Q.reject` creates a promise that rejects.

DONE.
