  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` and `Q.reject` have opposite meanings. In this case, `Q.resolve` would make the promise return a resolved value instead of a rejected error, which would cause the `fail` callback to not be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` with an error argument is equivalent to `Q.reject` with no arguments. This would cause the `fail` callback to still be executed, but with a different error than the one intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve("random string")
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` with a non-Error object as an argument would resolve the promise with a resolved value, which would cause the `fail` callback to not be executed.

DONE.
