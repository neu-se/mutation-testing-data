Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.options.tagValueProcessor(key, '' + jObj[key])
```
This would result in different behavior because it applies the `tagValueProcessor` function to the value, which may modify it, instead of directly using the value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
val + ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it concatenates the `val` with an empty string, which may cause issues if `val` is not a string, instead of directly using the `val`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.replaceEntitiesValue(val) + ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it applies the `replaceEntitiesValue` function to the `val` and then concatenates the result with an empty string, which may cause issues if the result is not a string, instead of directly using the `val`.

DONE.
