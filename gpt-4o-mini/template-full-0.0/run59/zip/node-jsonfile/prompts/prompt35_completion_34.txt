Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of the stringified object would cause the `writeFile` function to write `null` to the file, which is not the intended behavior of writing the serialized object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` would lead to the file being written with no content, which is different from the intended behavior of writing the stringified object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str + 'extra data'
```
This would result in different behavior because appending 'extra data' to the stringified object would change the content being written to the file, potentially corrupting the intended JSON structure.

DONE.
