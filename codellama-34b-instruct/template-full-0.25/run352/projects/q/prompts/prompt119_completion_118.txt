  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis(Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty` is a function, and `uncurryThis` expects a property name as its argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis(Object.prototype.toString)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString` is a function, and `uncurryThis` expects a property name as its argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis(Array.prototype.slice)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype.slice` is a function, and `uncurryThis` expects a property name as its argument.

DONE.
