  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the "apply" method to apply the function to the arguments, while the buggy code fragment uses the "apply" method to apply the function to the arguments and the "call" method to call the function with the specified this value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the "apply" method to apply the function to the arguments, while the buggy code fragment uses the "call" method to call the function with the specified this value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"bind"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the "apply" method to apply the function to the arguments, while the buggy code fragment uses the "bind" method to bind the function to the specified this value.

DONE.
