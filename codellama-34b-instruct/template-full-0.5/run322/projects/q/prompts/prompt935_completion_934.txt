  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method returns a shallow copy of the original array, while the `reverse` method reverses the elements of the array in place.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method returns a shallow copy of the original array, while the `length` property returns the number of elements in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method returns a shallow copy of the original array, while the `concat` method returns a new array that is the result of concatenating two or more arrays.

DONE.
