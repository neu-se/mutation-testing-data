Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of the object's own enumerable property values, rather than the keys, which would cause the subsequent logic to fail in filtering out null values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(attributes).filter(key => key.startsWith('a'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider keys that start with 'a', potentially omitting valid keys from `attributes` that do not meet this condition, leading to incomplete attribute copying.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(attributes).slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(1)` would skip the first key in the `attributes` object, which could lead to missing the first attribute during the reduction process, resulting in an incomplete final object.

DONE.
