  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `urlMap` to contain the same URL multiple times, leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `urlMap` to contain the same URL with different protocols, leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `urlMap` to contain the same URL with different hosts, leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
