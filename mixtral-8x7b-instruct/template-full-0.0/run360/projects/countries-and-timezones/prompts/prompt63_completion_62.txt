 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data, 'incorrectId'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `id` passed to `buildCountry` would be a string literal 'incorrectId', instead of the actual country id from the `data` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null, id
```
This would result in different behavior because `buildCountry` would receive `null` as its first argument, instead of the `data` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data, 42
```
This would result in different behavior because `buildCountry` would receive an integer as its second argument, instead of the expected country id as a string.

By introducing these changes, we aim to expose potential weaknesses in the test suite, as the tests should fail due to the unexpected behavior introduced in the code. DONE.
