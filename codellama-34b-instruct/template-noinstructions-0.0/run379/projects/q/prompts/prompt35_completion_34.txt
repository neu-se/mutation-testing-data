  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("This is a buggy code fragment");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not throw an error, but this code fragment does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `task` function, but this code fragment does not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `task` function with a parameter, but this code fragment does not.

DONE.
