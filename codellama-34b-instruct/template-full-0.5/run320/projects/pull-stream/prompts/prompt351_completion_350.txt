  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` method is not defined on the `test` object, and would return `undefined` instead of a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` method is not defined on the `test` object, and would return `undefined` instead of a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` method is not defined on the `test` object, and would return `undefined` instead of a function.

DONE.
