  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment converts the value of `attempt2[2]` to a number, while the replaced code fragment returns a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a number, while the replaced code fragment returns `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a number, while the replaced code fragment returns `null`.

DONE.
