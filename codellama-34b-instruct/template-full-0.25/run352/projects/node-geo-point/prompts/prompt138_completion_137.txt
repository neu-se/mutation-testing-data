  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the longitude instead of the latitude, which could cause errors in the calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the latitude, which could cause errors in the calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the latitude by 2, which could cause errors in the calculations.

DONE.
