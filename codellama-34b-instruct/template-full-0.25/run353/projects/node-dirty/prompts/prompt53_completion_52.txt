  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size && this._inFlightWrites > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `this._queue.size && (this._inFlightWrites > 0)`, which is different from the original expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size || this._inFlightWrites < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<` operator has a higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `this._queue.size || (this._inFlightWrites < 0)`, which is different from the original expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size && this._inFlightWrites === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator has a
