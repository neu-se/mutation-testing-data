  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Custom error");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to throw an error, whereas the original code would simply log a message to the console.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.error("Custom error");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to log an error message to the console, whereas the original code would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.exit(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the program to terminate with an exit code of 1, whereas the original code would simply log a message to the console.

DONE.
