  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator inverts the result of the `isInfinite` method, so a non-infinite value would be treated as infinite, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite` method checks if a value is finite (neither infinite nor NaN), which is the opposite of the `isInfinite` method. So, a finite value would be treated as infinite, and vice versa.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator inverts the result of the `isNaN` method, so a non-NaN value would be treated as NaN, and vice versa.

DONE.
