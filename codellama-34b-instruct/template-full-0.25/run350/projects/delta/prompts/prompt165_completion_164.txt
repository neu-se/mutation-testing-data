  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the type of the next operation in the other delta, rather than the current delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the length of the next operation in the current delta, rather than the type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the length of the next operation in the other delta, rather than the type.

DONE.
