  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` returns a new array with only the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, while `map` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` returns a shallow copy of a portion of the original array, while `map` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` changes the original array by removing or replacing existing elements, while `map` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the original array.

DONE.
