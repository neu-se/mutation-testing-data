  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.join(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `join` is a method that returns a promise that is resolved when all the promises in the specified array are resolved, while `promise` and `args` are both objects that are passed as arguments to the `Promise` constructor.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makePromise(descriptor, fallback, inspect)
```
This would result in different behavior because `makePromise` is a function that returns a promise based on the specified descriptor, fallback, and inspect functions, while `promise`, `args`, and `descriptor` are all objects that are passed as arguments to the `Promise` constructor.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.promiseDispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `promiseDispatch` is a method that is called on the `promise` object to resolve or reject it based on the specified arguments, while `this`
