  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(end - index)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate over the entire `this.ops` array, rather than just the portion between `start` and `end`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(end - index)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate over the entire `other.ops` array, rather than just the portion between `start` and `end`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(end - index)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate over the entire `this.ops` array, rather than just the portion between `start` and `end`.

DONE.
