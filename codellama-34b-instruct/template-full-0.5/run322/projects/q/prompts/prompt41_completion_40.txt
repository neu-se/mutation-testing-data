  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error, causing the program to crash, whereas the original code fragment would not throw an error and would continue executing the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("hello")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would log a message to the console, whereas the original code fragment would not log any message and would continue executing the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the program to return early, whereas the original code fragment would continue executing the program.

DONE.
