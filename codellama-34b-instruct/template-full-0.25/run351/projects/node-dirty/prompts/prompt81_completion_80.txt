  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error('Error message')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new error object with a different message, which would cause the `emit` method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a null value as the second argument to the `emit` method, which would cause the method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an undefined value as the second argument to the `emit` method, which would cause the method to behave differently.

DONE.
