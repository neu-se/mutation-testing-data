  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of the `Q` variable, while this new code fragment returns the number 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of the `Q` variable, while this new code fragment returns the value `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of the `Q` variable, while this new code fragment returns the value `undefined`.

DONE.
