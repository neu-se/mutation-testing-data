 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function creates a new deferred object, while `Promise.resolve()` immediately returns a resolved promise. This change would cause the `dispatch` method to resolve immediately instead of waiting for the next tick.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` returns a deferred object, but it is not the same as the original `defer` function. The `defer` function in the original code has access to the `when`, `reject`, and `resolve` methods from the parent scope, while `Q.defer()` does not. This change would likely cause the code to fail when attempting to use the `defer` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Promise(function (resolve, reject) { setTimeout(resolve, 0); })
```
This would result in different
