  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `data` variable directly, while this replacement uses the `toUpperCase()` method on the `data` variable, which could potentially change the value of the variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `data` variable directly, while this replacement adds 1 to the `data` variable, which could potentially change the value of the variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `data` variable directly, while this replacement uses the `length` property of the `data` variable, which could potentially change the value of the variable.

DONE.
