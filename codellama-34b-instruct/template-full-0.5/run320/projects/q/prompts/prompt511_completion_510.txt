  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp, args.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method returns a shallow copy of the `args` array, which would cause the `post` method to receive a different set of arguments than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp, args.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat()` method returns a new array that is the result of concatenating the `args` array with an empty array, which would cause the `post` method to receive a different set of arguments than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp, args.filter(function(arg) { return arg !== undefined; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter()` method returns a new array that contains only the elements of the `args` array that pass the test implemented by the provided function, which would cause the `post` method to receive a different set of arguments than
