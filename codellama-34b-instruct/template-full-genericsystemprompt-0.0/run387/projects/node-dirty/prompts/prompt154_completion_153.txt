  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork(false);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `uncork` method with no arguments, which means that the stream will be uncorked regardless of the value of the `this._waitForDrain` flag. In contrast, the new code fragment uses the `uncork` method with the argument `false`, which means that the stream will only be uncorked if the `this._waitForDrain` flag is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork(true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `uncork` method with no arguments, which means that the stream will be uncorked regardless of the value of the `this._waitForDrain` flag. In contrast, the new code fragment uses the `uncork` method with the argument `true`, which means that the stream will only be uncorked if the `this._waitForD
