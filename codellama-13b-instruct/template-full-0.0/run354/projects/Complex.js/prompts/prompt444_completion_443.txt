  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places * 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by 0 would cause the places variable to be set to 0, which would then be used as the exponent for the rounding operation. This would cause the rounding operation to always round to 0, regardless of the actual value of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction by 1 would cause the places variable to be set to -1, which would then be used as the exponent for the rounding operation. This would cause the rounding operation to always round to -1, regardless of the actual value of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition by 1 would cause the places variable to be set to 1, which would then be used as the exponent for the rounding operation. This would cause
