  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, args.slice(1)]
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the `slice` method to extract a subset of the `args` array, starting from the second element. This is a common mistake that can lead to unexpected behavior if the function is called with a different number of arguments than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, args.concat(args)]
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the `concat` method to concatenate the `args` array with itself. This can lead to unexpected behavior if the function is called with a large number of arguments, as it can cause a stack overflow.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, args.reverse()]
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the `reverse` method to reverse the order of the `args` array. This can lead to unexpected behavior if the function
