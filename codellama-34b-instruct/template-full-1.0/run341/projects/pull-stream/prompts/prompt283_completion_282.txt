  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(end, data) => { cb(end, data) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the arrow function would return a function that calls cb with the arguments, rather than calling cb directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { cb(end, data) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the arrow function would return a function that calls cb with the arguments, rather than calling cb directly, and it would do so immediately when the function is defined, rather than when it is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(data) || cb(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the console.log statement would be executed before the cb function is called, and it would also evaluate the truthiness of data before calling cb, which could result in different behavior depending on the value of data.

DONE.
