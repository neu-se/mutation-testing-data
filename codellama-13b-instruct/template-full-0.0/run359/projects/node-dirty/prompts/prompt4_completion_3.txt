  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete(key);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the key from the in-memory cache, but not from the on-disk file. This could cause issues if the key is later retrieved from the database, as it would not be found in the cache.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the key to `undefined` in the in-memory cache, but not in the on-disk file. This could cause issues if the key is later retrieved from the database, as it would not have a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would clear the entire in-memory cache, but not the on-disk file. This could cause issues if the database is later used, as it would not have any data.

DONE.
