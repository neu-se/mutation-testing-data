  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.slice(1)` would return a new array containing all elements of `args` except the first one, whereas `args` would return the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat([1])
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.concat([1])` would return a new array containing all elements of `args` followed by the number 1, whereas `args` would return the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.filter(function(x) { return x !== 1; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.filter(function(x) { return x !== 1; })` would return a new array containing all elements of `args` that are not equal to 1, whereas `args` would return the original array.

DONE.
