  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
';'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method would return an array with a single empty string element, instead of an array with the original string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'|'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method would return an array with two elements, the original string and an empty string, instead of an array with the original string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'&'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method would return an array with two elements, the original string and an empty string, instead of an array with the original string.

DONE.
