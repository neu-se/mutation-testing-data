  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER in the `calculateBearing` method can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ1) * sin(φ2) - sin(φ1) * cos(φ2) * cos(Δλ);
```
This would result in different behavior because the formula for calculating the bearing between two points on a sphere is different from the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER in the `calculateBearing` method can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1) * cos(φ2) + cos(φ1) * sin(φ2) * cos(Δλ);
```
This would result in different behavior because the formula for calculating the bearing between two points on a sphere is different from the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER in the `calculateBearing` method can be replaced with:
```
acos(x) * 180 / Math.PI;
```
This would result in different behavior because the formula for calculating the bearing between two points on a sphere is different from the original code
