Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ level: 0 }
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the compression level to 0 (uncompressed) regardless of the original `archiverOptions`, which may lead to unexpected results when compressing files.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it effectively ignores any `archiverOptions` that were passed in, leading to the default options being used instead, which may not match the intended configuration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ gzip: false }
```
This would result in different behavior because it disables gzip compression entirely, which would change the output format and potentially lead to larger file sizes or different file types than expected.

DONE.
