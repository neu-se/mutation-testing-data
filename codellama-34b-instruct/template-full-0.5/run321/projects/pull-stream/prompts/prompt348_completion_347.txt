  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the expression, so if `test.test` is truthy, `!test.test` will be falsy, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator adds 1 to the result of the expression, so if `test.test` is 0, `test.test + 1` will be 1, and if `test.test` is 1, `test.test + 1` will be 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method returns a string representation of the object, so if `test.test` is an object, `test.test.toString()` will return a string, and if `
