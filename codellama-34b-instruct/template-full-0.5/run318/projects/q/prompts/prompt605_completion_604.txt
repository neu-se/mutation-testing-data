  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is a function that rejects the promise, whereas `self.promiseDispatch` is a function that dispatches the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(op, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve(op, args)` would resolve the promise with the value of `op` and `args`, whereas `self.promiseDispatch` would dispatch the promise with the value of `op` and `args`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that rejects the promise, whereas `self.promiseDispatch` is a function that dispatches the promise.

DONE.
