  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' && (priority || otherIter.peekType() !== 'insert')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `transform` method to retain the insert operation from the other delta, even if the priority flag is set to `false`.
