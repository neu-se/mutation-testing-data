  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.filter(rule => rule.clone())
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter()` returns a new array with only the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, while `map()` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.slice(0, this.rules.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `map()` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.concat(this.rules)
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat()` returns a new array that is the result of merging two or more arrays, while `map()` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element
