  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `arguments` object, which is a special object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function. Replacing it with a fixed array would cause the function to always use the same set of arguments, regardless of how it was called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `arguments` object to determine the number of arguments passed to the function. Replacing it with `null` would cause the function to always think it was called with no arguments, regardless of how many arguments were actually passed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `arguments` object to determine the number of arguments passed to the function. Replacing it with `undefined` would cause the function to always think it was called
