  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1; i <= lines.length; ++i
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at 1 instead of 0, and would iterate one extra time.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i < lines.length - 1; ++i
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one less time than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i <= lines.length - 1; ++i
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one less time than the original code, and the last iteration would include the index of the last element instead of going past it.

DONE.
