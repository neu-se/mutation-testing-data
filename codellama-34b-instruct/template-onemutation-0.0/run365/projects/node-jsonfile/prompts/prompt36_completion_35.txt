  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options` is an object with properties that are used to configure the `writeFile` method, while `null` is a primitive value that does not have any properties. Using `null` instead of `options` would cause the `writeFile` method to use the default configuration, which may not be the desired behavior.

DONE.
