  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because `set` would always set the value of the key to `undefined`, regardless of whether `val` is `undefined` or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete(key);
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` would remove the key-value pair from the map, regardless of whether `val` is `undefined` or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, val + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because `set` would set the value of the key to `val + 1`, regardless of whether `val` is `undefined` or not.

DONE.
