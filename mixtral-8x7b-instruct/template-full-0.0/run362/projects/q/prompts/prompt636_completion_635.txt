 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolveThrown
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolveThrown` would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved, which is different from the original behavior of just calling `deferred.resolve`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.promise` is the promise object itself, and calling `dispatch` on it would not have the desired effect of forwarding the message to the original object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always resolve the promise with a value of `null`, regardless of the arguments passed to `dispatch`. This is different from the original behavior, which forwards the message to the original object and resolves the promise with the result of the operation.

DONE.
