  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!busy
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `busy`, so the `if` statement would execute the opposite branch than it would with the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
busy && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than the `!` operator, so the `if` statement would evaluate to `false` if `busy` is `true`, and `true` if `busy` is `false`, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
busy || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has a higher precedence than the `!` operator, so the `if` statement would evaluate to `true` if `busy` is `false`, and `false` if `busy` is `true`, which is the opposite of the
