  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'insert' && (offset > index || priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the next type is 'insert' and if the offset is less than the index or if priority is false, while this new code checks if the next type is 'insert' and if the offset is greater than the index or if priority is true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'insert' && (offset === index || !priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the next type is 'insert' and if the offset is less than the index or if priority is false, while this new code checks if the next type is 'insert' and if the offset is equal to the index or if priority is true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'insert' && (offset !== index || priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the next
