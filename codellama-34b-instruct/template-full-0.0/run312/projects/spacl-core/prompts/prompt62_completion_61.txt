  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `reverse()` is a method that reverses the order of the elements in an array, while `reverse` is a property that returns the reversed order of the elements in an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.slice().reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` creates a shallow copy of the array, while `reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.sort()
```
This would result in different behavior because `sort()` sorts the elements of an array in place, while `reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in an array.

DONE.
