Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the length of `rowStr` is zero instead of checking if `rowStr` is falsy, which could lead to different handling of strings that are not empty but still considered invalid.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it specifically checks if `rowStr` is `null`, which would not catch empty strings or undefined values, potentially allowing invalid data to be processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for an exact match to an empty string, which would not account for other falsy values like `undefined` or `null`, leading to a failure to emit an error for those cases.

DONE.
