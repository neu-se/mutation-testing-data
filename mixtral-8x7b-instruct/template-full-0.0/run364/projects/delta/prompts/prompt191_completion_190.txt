 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.assign({}, newOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of `newOp`, and any modifications to the new object will not affect the original `newOp`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(newOp))
