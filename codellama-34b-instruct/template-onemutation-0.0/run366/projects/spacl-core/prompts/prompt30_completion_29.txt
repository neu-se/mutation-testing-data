  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => seg - acc
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `+` operator to concatenate the `seg` and `acc` strings, while the new code fragment uses the `-` operator to subtract the `acc` string from the `seg` string. This would cause the resulting string to be different from the original string.

DONE.
