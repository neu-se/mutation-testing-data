  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn = () => false;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fn` function would always return `false`, causing the `forEach` loop to prematurely exit, potentially skipping over some keys in the database.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn = () => 'hello';
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fn` function would always return `'hello'`, which is a non-empty string, and would never match the `key` argument passed to the `forEach` loop. This would cause the loop to iterate over all keys in the database, even if the `key` argument is not present.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn = () => '';
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fn` function would always return an empty string, which would match all keys in the database. This would cause the loop to exit immediately, potentially skipping over some keys.

DONE.
