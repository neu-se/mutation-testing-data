 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'0'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sign` method would return a complex number with real and imaginary parts equal to 0, instead of a normalized complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a division by zero error when the imaginary part of the complex number is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re'] > 0 ? 1 : -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a complex number with a positive real part, regardless of the original sign of the real part.

DONE.
