  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end. In this context, `unshift` would cause the callback to be passed as the first argument to the function, rather than the last, which could potentially cause unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` returns a new array that is the result of concatenating the elements of two arrays, whereas `push` adds an element to an existing array. In this context, `concat` would cause the callback to be added to the end of a new array, rather than the existing `nodeArgs` array, which could potentially cause the callback to not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes the last element of an array, whereas `
