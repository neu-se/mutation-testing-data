  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value, errback, callback
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments to `when` is reversed, which could cause the promise to be rejected instead of fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value, callback, errback, result.value
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument is being passed to `when`, which could cause an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value, callback, errback, result.value, result.value
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument is being passed to `when`, which could cause an error to be thrown. Additionally, the result of the promise is being passed twice, which could cause the promise to be fulfilled with a different value than expected.

DONE.
