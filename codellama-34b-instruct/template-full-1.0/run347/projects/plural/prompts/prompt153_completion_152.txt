  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the value of the `this` keyword, which refers to the object that the method was called on, while the replaced code uses the string "foo".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the value of the `num` parameter, while the replaced code adds 1 to the value of `num`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof num === "number"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the value of the `num` parameter, while the replaced code checks whether `num` is a number.

DONE.
