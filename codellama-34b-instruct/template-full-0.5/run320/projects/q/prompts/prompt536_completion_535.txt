  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the value of the promise to the `spread` method instead of the promise itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that resolves to the value of the original promise, instead of passing the original promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that resolves to the value of the original promise, instead of passing the original promise.

DONE.
