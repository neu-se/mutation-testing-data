  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = !end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `end`, so if `end` is truthy, it will become falsy, and vice versa. This change would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if `end` is `true`, which would result in the `done` callback being called with a value that is different from what the original code intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = end && abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator performs a logical AND operation on `end` and `abort`, so if either `end` or `abort` is falsy, the result will be falsy. This change would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if `end` is `true`, which would result in the `done` callback being called with a value that is different from what the original code intended.

Option 3: The
