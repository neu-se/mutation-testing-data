  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `captureLine` is used to capture the current line number for stack trace purposes, whereas `1 + 1` is an arbitrary expression that does not have the same purpose.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("Q.js mutation testing")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `captureLine` is used to control the behavior of the `Q.js` library, whereas `console.log("Q.js mutation testing")` is a logging statement that does not have any affect on the library's behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Q.js` returns a promise that resolves to the result of the `Q.js` library's
