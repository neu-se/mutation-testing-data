  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseUrl.protocol` is a string representing the protocol of the URL, while `baseUrl` is an object containing various properties of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseUrl.host` is a string representing the hostname of the URL, while `baseUrl` is an object containing various properties of the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseUrl.pathname` is a string representing the pathname of the URL, while `baseUrl` is an object containing various properties of the URL.

DONE.
