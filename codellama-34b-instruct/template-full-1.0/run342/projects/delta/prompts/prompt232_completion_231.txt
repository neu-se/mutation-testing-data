  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength()` method returns the length of the next op in the iterator, and adding 2 would cause the inserted string to have a different length, which could affect the behavior of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekType()` method returns the type of the next op in the iterator, and inserting a different type of op could cause the program to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method returns the next op in the iterator, and inserting a different op could cause the program to behave differently.

DONE.
