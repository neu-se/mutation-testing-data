  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` object is not a promise and does not have a `fail` method, so the code would throw a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` returns a rejected promise, which means that the `get` method would return a rejected promise instead of a resolved one, and the `fail` method would not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` returns a resolved promise with the value of the `error` object, which means that the `get` method would return a resolved promise with the `error` object as its value, and the `fail` method would not be called.

DONE.
