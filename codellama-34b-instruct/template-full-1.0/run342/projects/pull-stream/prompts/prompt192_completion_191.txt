  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map = prop.apply(null, [])
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.apply()` with an empty array would return a function that returns `undefined`, which is not the same as the original `map` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map = prop.apply(null, [1, 2, 3])
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.apply()` with an array of numbers would return a function that returns a different value than the original `map` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map = prop.apply(null, ['a', 'b', 'c'])
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.apply()` with an array of strings would return a function that returns a different value than the original `map` function.

DONE.
