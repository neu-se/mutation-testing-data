  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var next = Q.defer();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.defer()` function creates a new deferred object, which is not the same as the `next` variable that is expected to be a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var next = Q.reject();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.reject()` function creates a rejected promise, which is not the same as the `next` variable that is expected to be a resolved promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var next = Q.resolve();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.resolve()` function creates a resolved promise, which is not the same as the `next` variable that is expected to be a rejected promise.

DONE.
