  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isInternalFrame(line) && !isNodeFrame(line) && line
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include internal frames and node frames in the stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isInternalFrame(line) && !isNodeFrame(line) && !line
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude internal frames and node frames in the stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isInternalFrame(line) && !isNodeFrame(line) && line.indexOf("at ") === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only include lines that start with "at " in the stack trace.

DONE.
