  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns a rejected promise with the exception object, while this modified code returns a resolved promise with the undefined value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns a rejected promise with the exception object, while this modified code returns a resolved promise with the null value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns a rejected promise with the exception object, while this modified code returns a resolved promise with the false value.

DONE.
