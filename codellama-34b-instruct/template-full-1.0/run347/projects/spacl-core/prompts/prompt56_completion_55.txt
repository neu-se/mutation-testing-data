  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.replace(/[.]/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression used in the original code fragment matches a literal `.`, but the replacement code fragment matches any character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.replace(/\//g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression used in the original code fragment matches a literal `/`, but the replacement code fragment matches any character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.replace(/[\W_]+/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression used in the original code fragment matches any non-word character and `_`, but the replacement code fragment matches any character.

DONE.
