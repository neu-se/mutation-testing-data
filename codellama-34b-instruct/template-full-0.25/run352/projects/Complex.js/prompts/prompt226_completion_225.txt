  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` takes a single argument, whereas `Math.sqrt(a, b)` takes two arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt(a, b)` returns the square root of `a` and `b`, whereas `Math.sqrt(a)` returns the square root of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt(a + b)` returns the square root of `a + b`, whereas `Math.sqrt(a, b)` returns the square root of `a` and `b`.

DONE.
