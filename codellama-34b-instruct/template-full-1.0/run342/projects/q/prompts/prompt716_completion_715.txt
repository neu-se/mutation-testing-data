  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
method = deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` method is not the same as the `dispatch` method and would cause the promise chain to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
method = Q.when
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when` is not the same as `dispatch` and would change the way the promise chain is handled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
method = Q.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.apply` is not the same as `dispatch` and would cause the promise chain to behave differently.

DONE.
