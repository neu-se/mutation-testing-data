  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter` refers to the `OpIterator` for the `other` Delta, which may have a different length than `thisIter`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType().length
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekType()` returns the type of the next operation in the iterator's buffer, which may have a different length than the actual operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.min(otherIter.peekLength(), thisIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because it takes into account the length of both iterators, ensuring that the resulting `Delta` is not too long.

DONE.
