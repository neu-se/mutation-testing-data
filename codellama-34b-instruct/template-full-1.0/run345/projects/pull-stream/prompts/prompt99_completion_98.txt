  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err === false ? null : err
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the callback function to be called with a non-null value even if the input error is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.message === 'error' ? null : err
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the callback function to be called with a non-null value if the error message is not equal to 'error'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code === 404 ? null : err
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the callback function to be called with a non-null value if the error code is not 404.

DONE.
