  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with "null".

This would result in different behavior because if the returned array contains only one element, the "self" keyword will be used to return the array itself, whereas "null" will simply return an empty array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with "undefined".

This would result in different behavior because if the returned array contains only one element, the "self" keyword will be used to return the array itself, whereas "undefined" will simply return an empty array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with "true".

This would result in different behavior because if the returned array contains only one element, the "self" keyword will be used to return the array itself, whereas "true" will simply return an empty array.

DONE.
