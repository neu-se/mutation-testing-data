  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/i, 'http://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regular expression would ignore case sensitivity, resulting in matching URIs with uppercase characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/g, 'http://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regular expression would match all occurrences of the pattern, not just the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/gim, 'http://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag would match all occurrences of the pattern, the `i` flag would ignore case sensitivity, and the `m` flag would match over multiple lines.

DONE.
