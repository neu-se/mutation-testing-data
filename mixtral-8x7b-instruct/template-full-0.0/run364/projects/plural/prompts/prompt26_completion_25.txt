 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the incorrect plural form for words that maintain latin/greek plural and end with 'i'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-2
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the incorrect plural form for words that maintain latin/greek plural and end with 'us', 'is', or 'os'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
w.length - 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the incorrect plural form for words that maintain latin/greek plural and end with 'a', 'e', or 'o'.

DONE.
