 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the sine of φ2 is being used instead of φ2 itself, which can produce a different value and thus affect the result of the `calculateDestination` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because a constant value of 1 is being used instead of φ2, which can lead to incorrect calculations in the `calculateDestination` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
point1.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude of the first point is being used instead of φ2, which can lead to incorrect calculations in the `calculateDestination` method.

DONE.
