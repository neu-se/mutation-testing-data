  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function would be called immediately, rather than being passed as a callback to the `then` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would not have a callback to call when the promise is rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would have a callback that does nothing, rather than calling the `onUnhandledError` function.

DONE.
