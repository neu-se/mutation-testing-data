  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[that, this]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the elements in the array is reversed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[this, this]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second element is not `that`, but instead it is `this` again, which would cause the `join` method to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[that, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second element is `undefined`, which would cause the `join` method to throw an error.

Please conclude your response with "DONE."
