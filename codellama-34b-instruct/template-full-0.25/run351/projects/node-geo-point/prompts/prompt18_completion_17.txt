  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty('latitude') && object.hasOwnProperty('longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `object` is not an object, while this replacement checks if `object` does not have the properties `latitude` and `longitude`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!object.hasOwnProperty('latitude') || !object.hasOwnProperty('longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `object` is not an object, while this replacement checks if `object` does not have either the `latitude` or `longitude` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.latitude === undefined || object.longitude === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `object` is not an object, while this replacement checks if `object.latitude` or `object.long
