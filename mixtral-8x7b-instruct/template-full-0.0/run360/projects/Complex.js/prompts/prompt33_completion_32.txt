 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / Math.log
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the result of the logarithm function, which can lead to incorrect values or exceptions when the input is 0 or a negative number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.log(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return -Infinity, regardless of the input values, which is not the intended behavior of the logHypot function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.SQRT2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the logarithm function with a constant value, which would not depend on the input values and would not provide any meaningful output.

DONE.
