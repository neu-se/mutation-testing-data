Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` to `Object.prototype.toString.call` will return `[object Null]`, which is not the expected type string for any object, leading to incorrect type identification.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` to `Object.prototype.toString.call` will return `[object Undefined]`, which again does not match the expected type string for any object, causing potential failures in type checks.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because passing a number (like `42`) to `Object.prototype.toString.call` will return `[object Number]`, which is not the expected type string for an object, leading to incorrect type identification and potentially affecting the logic that relies on the type being an object.

DONE.
