  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
9
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was raising 10 to the power of 'places', while this replacement would be raising 9 to the power of 'places', resulting in a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
100
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was raising 10 to the power of 'places', while this replacement would be raising 100 to the power of 'places', resulting in a much larger value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was raising 10 to the power of 'places', while this replacement would be raising 0 to the power of 'places', resulting in a value of 0.

DONE.
