  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `onAbort` function, while the new code fragment is a function call to the `onAbort` function. This could potentially cause the test suite to fail if the `onAbort` function is not properly mocked or stubbed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `onAbort` function, while the new code fragment is a function call to the `onAbort` function with the `this` context set to the current context. This could potentially cause the test suite to fail if the `onAbort` function is not properly mocked or stubbed, or if the `this` context is not properly set.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort.apply(this, [])
```
This would result
