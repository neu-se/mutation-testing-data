  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `1` is a truthy value, while `0` is a falsy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `1` is a truthy value, while `null` is a falsy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `1` is a truthy value, while `undefined` is a falsy value.

DONE.
