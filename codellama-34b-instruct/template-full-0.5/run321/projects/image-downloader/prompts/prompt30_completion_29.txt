  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimRight
```
This would result in different behavior because `trimRight` removes characters from the end of the string, whereas `trimLeft` removes characters from the beginning of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(1)` returns a substring of the original string, starting from the second character, whereas `trimLeft` removes characters from the beginning of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.replace(/^https?:\/\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because `replace` replaces the first occurrence of the regular expression `/^https?:\/\//` (i.e. the protocol and the first two slashes) with an empty string, whereas `trimLeft` removes characters from the beginning of the string.

DONE.
