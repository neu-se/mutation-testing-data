  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!done
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `done`, so the `if` statement would always evaluate to `true`, even if `done` was previously set to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done = false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set `done` to `false`, regardless of its previous value. This would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if `done` was previously set to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done = !done
```
This would result in different behavior because it would toggle the value of `done` between `true` and `false`, regardless of its previous value. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if `done` was previously set to `false`, and to `false` if `done` was previously set to `true`.

DONE.
