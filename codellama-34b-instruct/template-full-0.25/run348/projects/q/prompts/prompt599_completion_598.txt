  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the first argument of the `dispatch` method as the second argument of the `promiseDispatch` method, instead of passing the `args` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `args` array without the first element, instead of passing the `args` array as is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an empty array as the second argument of the `promiseDispatch` method, instead of passing the `args` array.

DONE.
