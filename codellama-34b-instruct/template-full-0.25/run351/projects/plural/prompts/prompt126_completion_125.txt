  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num !== 1 || num === undefined || num === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also check for the case where `num` is 0, which is not handled by the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num !== 1 || num === undefined || num === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also check for the case where `num` is Infinity, which is not handled by the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num !== 1 || num === undefined || num === NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also check for the case where `num` is NaN (Not a Number), which is not handled by the original code fragment.

DONE.
