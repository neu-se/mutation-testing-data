  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'PLACEHOLDER'
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the value with a string, which would cause the `indexOf` function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the value with a boolean, which would cause the `indexOf` function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the value with a null, which would cause the `indexOf` function to return a different value.

DONE.
