  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dstOffset + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dstOffset` variable is used to calculate the `dstOffsetStr` property, and adding 1 to it would change the resulting string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
utcOffset
```
This would result in different behavior because the `utcOffset` variable is used to calculate the `utcOffsetStr` property, and using it instead of `dstOffset` would change the resulting string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isInteger(utcOffset) ? utcOffset : dstOffset
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `utcOffset` is an integer, and if it is, it would use it to calculate the `dstOffsetStr` property, otherwise it would use `dstOffset`.

DONE.
