 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'criteria', 'criterion'
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the original match and replacement values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'criterion', function(w) { return w + 'a' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it always appends an 'a' to the word instead of correctly handling the plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/criterion$/i, 'criteria'
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a regular expression to match 'criterion' but doesn't use a function to handle the replacement, so it would always replace 'criterion' with 'criteria' regardless of the number.

DONE.
