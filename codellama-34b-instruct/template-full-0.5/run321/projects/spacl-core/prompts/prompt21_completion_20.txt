  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `\\` escape sequence is not a valid path separator, and would cause the `Matcher` constructor to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `/` character is not a valid path separator, and would cause the `Matcher` constructor to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `\\` escape sequence is not a valid path separator, and would cause the `Matcher` constructor to throw an error.

DONE.
