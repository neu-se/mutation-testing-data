  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument would be passed to the `nfapply` method instead of the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would return a new array containing all elements of the `arguments` object starting from the third element, instead of just the second element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of the `arguments` object would be used to determine the number of arguments to pass to the `nfapply` method, instead of just the second argument.

DONE.
