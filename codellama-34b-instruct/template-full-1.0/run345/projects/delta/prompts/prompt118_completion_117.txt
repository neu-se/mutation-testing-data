  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(<PLACEHOLDER> = "")
```
This would result in different behavior because "=" is a weak comparison operator that does not check for the same type, which can lead to strange behaviors when comparing different data types.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(<PLACEHOLDER> === null)
```
This would result in different behavior because "===" is a strict comparison operator that checks for the same type and value, which can lead to different behavior when comparing different data types.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(<PLACEHOLDER> !== undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because "!==" is a strict comparison operator that checks for the same type and value, which can lead to different behavior when comparing different data types.

DONE.
