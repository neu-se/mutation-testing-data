  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val
```
This would result in different behavior because `row.val` is the value associated with the key, whereas `row.key` is the key itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the string `'foo'` to the key, which would change the key and potentially cause the code to access the wrong data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to try to access the value associated with the key `null`, which may not exist or may have different behavior than the original code.

DONE.
