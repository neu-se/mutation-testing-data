  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"send"
```
This would result in different behavior because the method `npost` would be replaced with `nsend`, which has a different implementation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"dispatch"
```
This would result in different behavior because the method `npost` would be replaced with `dispatch`, which has a different implementation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply"
```
This would result in different behavior because the method `npost` would be replaced with `apply`, which has a different implementation.

DONE.
