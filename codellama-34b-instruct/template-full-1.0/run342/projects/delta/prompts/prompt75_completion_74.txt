  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clone
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method creates a shallow copy of an object, which may not have the same effect as `cloneDeep`, which creates a deep copy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that does not have any properties or methods, while `cloneDeep` returns a deep copy of an object, which may have properties and methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<empty string>
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty string is a valid value, but it may not have the same effect as `cloneDeep`, which returns a deep copy of an object.

DONE.
