  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.bind(this)` is a bound function that will always refer to the current object, whereas `this.dispatch` is a reference to the `dispatch` method of the current object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.call(this)` is a function call that will always refer to the current object, whereas `this.dispatch` is a reference to the `dispatch` method of the current object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.apply(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.apply(this)` is a function call that will always refer to the current object, whereas `this.dispatch` is a reference to the `dispatch` method of the current object.

DONE.
