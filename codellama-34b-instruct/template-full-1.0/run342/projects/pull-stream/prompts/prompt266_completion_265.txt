  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, data
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of passing `null` as the first argument, `undefined` would be passed, which could potentially cause issues with the function's parsing and processing of the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, null
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of passing `null` as the second argument, `data` would be passed, which could potentially cause issues with the function's parsing and processing of the stream.
