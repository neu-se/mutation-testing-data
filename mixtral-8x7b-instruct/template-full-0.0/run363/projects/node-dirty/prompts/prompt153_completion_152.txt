 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` is not a method that exists on a writable stream, and attempting to call it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork(); this._queue.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would clear the `_queue` of any pending writes, which would cause data loss if there were any pending writes that had not yet been written to the file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork = () => {};
```
This would result in different behavior because it would override the `uncork` method of the `_writeStream` with an empty function, effectively disabling the ability to uncork the stream. This could cause the stream to stop writing data to the file if it becomes blocked.

DONE.
