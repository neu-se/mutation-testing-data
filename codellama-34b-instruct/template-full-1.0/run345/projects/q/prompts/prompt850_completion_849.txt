  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error && "string" === typeof error
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the original check, ensuring that the code will only execute when `error` is defined and is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error || "string" !== typeof error
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the original check, ensuring that the code will only execute when `error` is undefined or not a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"string" === typeof error
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the check for `error` being defined and always executes the code if `error` is a string.

DONE.
