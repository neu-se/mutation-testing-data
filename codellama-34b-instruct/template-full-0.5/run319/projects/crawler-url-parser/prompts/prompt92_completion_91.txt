  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `href.length` would return the length of the `href` string, which is not the same as the original code fragment that returns the value of the `href` attribute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because `href.trim()` would return the trimmed version of the `href` string, which is not the same as the original code fragment that returns the value of the `href` attribute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `href.toLowerCase()` would return the `href` string in lowercase, which is not the same as the original code fragment that returns the value of the `href` attribute.

DONE.
