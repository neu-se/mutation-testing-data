  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id, options, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `null` argument would cause the `getCountry` function to throw an error, as it expects only two arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id, options, {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `{}` argument would cause the `getCountry` function to return an empty object, as it expects only two arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id, options, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `undefined` argument would cause the `getCountry` function to return `undefined`, as it expects only two arguments.

DONE.
