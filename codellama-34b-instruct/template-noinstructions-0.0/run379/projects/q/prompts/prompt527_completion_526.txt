  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object, op, args
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `dispatch` function to be called with the wrong arguments, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object, op
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `dispatch` function to be called with only two arguments, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op, args
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `dispatch` function to be called with the wrong arguments, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

DONE.
