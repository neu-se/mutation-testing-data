  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer(null)` would create a new deferred object with a null value, which would cause the promise to be resolved with a null value instead of the expected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer(undefined)` would create a new deferred object with an undefined value, which would cause the promise to be resolved with an undefined value instead of the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer(new Error())` would create a new deferred object with an error value, which would cause the promise to be rejected with an error instead of being resolved with the expected value.

DONE.
