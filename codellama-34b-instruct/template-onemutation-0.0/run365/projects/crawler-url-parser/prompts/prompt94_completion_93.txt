  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href + " "
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only returns the value of the `href` attribute, while the modified code fragment returns the value of the `href` attribute concatenated with a space. This change would cause the `parse` function to return a different value, which could potentially cause the `extract` function to behave differently.

DONE.
