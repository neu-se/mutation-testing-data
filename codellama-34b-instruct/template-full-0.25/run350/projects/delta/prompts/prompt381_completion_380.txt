  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the iterator to advance by one more position than in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the iterator to advance by one less position than in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the iterator to advance by twice the original length.

DONE.
