  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('goose', 'geese')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a new rule to the `rules` array, while this replacement code fragment would modify the existing rule for "goose" to have the plural form "geese".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('goose', 'gooses')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a new rule to the `rules` array, while this replacement code fragment would modify the existing rule for "goose" to have the plural form "gooses".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('goose', 'goses')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a new rule to the `rules` array, while this replacement code fragment would modify the existing rule for "goose" to have the plural form "goses".

DONE.
