Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly treat valid objects as invalid, leading to the function always initializing `a` to an empty object, even when `a` is a valid object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if `a` is an array, allowing non-object types (like strings or numbers) to pass through as valid, which could lead to unexpected results when processing `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat both `null` and `undefined` as valid cases, potentially allowing these values to be passed as `a`, which would not be the intended behavior of the original check.

DONE.
