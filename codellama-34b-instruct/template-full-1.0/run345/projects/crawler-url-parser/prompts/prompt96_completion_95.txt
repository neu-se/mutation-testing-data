  Option 1:

The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
$('base').attr('href') + $(this).attr('href')
```

This would result in different behavior because the current URL being parsed would include the base URL, which is not the case in the original code.

Option 2:

The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
`http://${thisText}`
```

This would result in different behavior because the current URL being parsed would be parsed as a HTTP URL, rather than a web URL.

Option 3:

The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
`${thisText}${baseUrlStr}`
```

This would result in different behavior because the current URL being parsed would include the base URL, but the base URL would be included in a different way than in the original code.

DONE.
