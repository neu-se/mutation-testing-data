  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length < 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `arguments` object has a length of exactly 2, while this new code fragment checks if the `arguments` object has a length that is less than 2. This change would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` in cases where the original code fragment would have evaluated to `false`, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length > 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `arguments` object has a length of exactly 2, while this new code fragment checks if the `arguments` object has a length that is greater than 2. This change would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` in cases where the original code fragment would have evaluated to `false`, and vice versa.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length === 3
```
