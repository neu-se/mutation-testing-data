  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.pop(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop` method would remove the last element from the `ops` array, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.shift(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `shift` method would remove the first element from the `ops` array, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would remove a range of elements from the `ops` array, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
