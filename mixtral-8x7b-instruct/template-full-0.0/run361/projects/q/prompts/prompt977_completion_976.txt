 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer()` creates a new deferred object and returns its promise, while `Promise.resolve` immediately returns a resolved promise. This change would bypass the actual execution of the asynchronous operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { throw new Error('Bypassing the deferred object'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it throws an error instead of creating a deferred object. This would cause the `fail` method to be called, and the error would be passed to the nodeback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` is an alias for `Q()`, which creates a new promise. However, it does not create a new deferred object like `defer()`. This change would cause the promise to be resolved immediately, bypassing the asynchronous
