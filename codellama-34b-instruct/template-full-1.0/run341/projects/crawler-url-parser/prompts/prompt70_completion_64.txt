  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$
```
This would result in different behavior because `cheerio.load` is a function that takes an HTML string and an optional configuration object as arguments, while `$` is a function that takes a jQuery collection as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$("body")
```
This would result in different behavior because `cheerio.load` by itself would return a new Cheerio instance based on the HTML string, while `$("body")` would return a jQuery collection containing all the elements with a `body` tag in the HTML string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(document)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cheerio.load` by itself would return a new Cheerio instance based on the HTML string, while `$(document)` would return a jQuery collection containing all the elements in the HTML string.

DONE.
