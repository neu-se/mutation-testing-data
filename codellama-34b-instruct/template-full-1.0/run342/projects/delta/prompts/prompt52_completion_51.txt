  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `b` is a string, so `b + 1` would result in a concatenation of the strings, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `b` is a string, so `b.toUpperCase()` would result in all characters of the string being converted to uppercase, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `b` is a string, so `b[0]` would result in the first character of the string being accessed, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
