Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of creating a deferred object that can resolve or reject, it immediately returns a rejected promise, causing the `any` function to fail without waiting for any of the promises to settle.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a resolved promise instead of a deferred object, which means that the `any` function would resolve immediately without waiting for any of the promises to be fulfilled or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Promise((resolve, reject) => {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new Promise that is neither resolved nor rejected, leading to the `any` function hanging indefinitely if all promises are rejected, as it would never reach a state to resolve or reject the deferred object.

DONE.
