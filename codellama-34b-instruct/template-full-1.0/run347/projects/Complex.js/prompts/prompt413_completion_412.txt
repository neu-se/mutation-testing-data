  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with different code fragments:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `tan` function takes a single argument, while `log` function takes two arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin` function takes a single argument, while `log` function takes two arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `cos` function takes a single argument, while `log` function takes two arguments.

DONE.
