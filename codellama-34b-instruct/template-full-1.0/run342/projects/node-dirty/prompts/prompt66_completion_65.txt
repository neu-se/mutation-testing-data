  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because `end()` is a method that signals the end of the stream, while `destroy()` is a method that destroys the stream. If `this._writeStream.end()` is used instead of `this._writeStream.destroy()`, the stream would not be closed and the data would not be persisted to the file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write(data, () => console.log('Data written:', data))
```
This would result in different behavior because `write()` is a method that writes data to the stream, but it does not take a callback function as an argument. If `console.log()` is used instead of `cb()`, the data would be logged to the console instead of being passed to the callback function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.once('drain', cb)
```
This would result in different behavior
