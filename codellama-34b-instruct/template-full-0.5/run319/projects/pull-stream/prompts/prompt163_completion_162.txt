  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `!array` checks if the variable `array` is falsy, while `array.length === 0` checks if the length of the array is equal to 0. If the array is empty, both conditions would be true, but if the array has any elements, the original code fragment would return `true`, while the new code fragment would return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `!array` checks if the variable `array` is falsy, while `array.length > 0` checks if the length of the array is greater than 0. If the array has any elements, the original code fragment would return `false`, while the new code fragment would return `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length === 1
```
