  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(baseUrlStr, true, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` value passed as the third argument would cause the `search` property of the parsed URL to be excluded, which could affect the behavior of the `extract` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(baseUrlStr, false, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` value passed as the second argument would cause the `hash` property of the parsed URL to be excluded, which could affect the behavior of the `extract` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(baseUrlStr, true, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `true` value passed as the third argument would cause the `search` property of the parsed URL to be included, which could affect the behavior of the `extract` function.

DONE.
