  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is not matching the same pattern as the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is not replacing the same pattern as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is not replacing the same pattern as the original code.

DONE.
