  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh(x+1)
```
This would result in different behavior because sinh(x+1) would increase the value of the argument to sinh, which would result in a larger value being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh(x-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because sinh(x-1) would decrease the value of the argument to sinh, which would result in a smaller value being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh(x+x)
```
This would result in different behavior because sinh(x+x) would double the value of the argument to sinh, which would result in a larger value being returned.

DONE.
