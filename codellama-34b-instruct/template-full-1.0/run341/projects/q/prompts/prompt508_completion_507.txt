  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `apply` method to be called on the global object, rather than on the `thisp` object as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp['apply']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `apply` method to be called on the global object, rather than on the `thisp` object as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
apply(thisp, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `apply` method with the `thisp` object as the context, rather than the global object as intended.

DONE.
