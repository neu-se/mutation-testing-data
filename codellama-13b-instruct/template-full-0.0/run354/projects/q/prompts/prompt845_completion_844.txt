  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ms + 1, error
```
This would result in different behavior because the timeout would be increased by 1 millisecond, which would cause the promise to be rejected later than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ms - 1, error
```
This would result in different behavior because the timeout would be decreased by 1 millisecond, which would cause the promise to be rejected earlier than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ms, new Error("Custom error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because a new error object would be created with a custom error message, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a different error than the original code.

DONE.
