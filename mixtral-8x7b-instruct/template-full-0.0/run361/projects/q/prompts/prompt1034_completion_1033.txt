 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
qEndingLine = 42;
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable `qEndingLine` is being reassigned to a number instead of capturing the line number. This change will prevent proper stack traces if any errors occur in the Q library.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
var qEndingLine = 'captureLine';
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable `qEndingLine` is being reassigned to a string instead of capturing the line number. This change will prevent proper stack traces if any errors occur in the Q library.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function captureLine() { return 42; }
qEndingLine = captureLine();
```
This would result in different behavior because `qEndingLine` is being assigned the result of calling the `captureLine` function, which always returns `42`. This change will prevent proper stack traces if any
