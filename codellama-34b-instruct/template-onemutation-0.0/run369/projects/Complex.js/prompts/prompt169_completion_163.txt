  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `this` is zero or `z` is infinite, while the new code fragment checks if `this` is zero and `z` is infinite, which is a different condition.

DONE.
