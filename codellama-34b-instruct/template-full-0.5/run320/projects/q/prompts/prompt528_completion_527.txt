  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).inspect.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a specific `this` value and arguments, whereas the original code fragment does not use `bind`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).inspect.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` calls a function with a specific `this` value and arguments, whereas the original code fragment does not use `call`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).inspect.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` calls a function with a specific `this` value and arguments, whereas the original code fragment does not use `apply`.

DONE.
