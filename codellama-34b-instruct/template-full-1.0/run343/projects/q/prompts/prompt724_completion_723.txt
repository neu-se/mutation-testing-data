  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a Promise object as input, but the replaced code provides a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a Promise object as input, but the replaced code provides undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
window
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a Promise object as input, but the replaced code provides the Window object.

DONE.
