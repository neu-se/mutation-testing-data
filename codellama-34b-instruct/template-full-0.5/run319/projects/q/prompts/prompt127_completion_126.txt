  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.key
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be accessing the `key` property of the object, rather than the `key` parameter passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key++
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be incrementing the `key` parameter passed to the function, rather than simply returning it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be adding 1 to the `key` parameter passed to the function, rather than simply returning it.

DONE.
