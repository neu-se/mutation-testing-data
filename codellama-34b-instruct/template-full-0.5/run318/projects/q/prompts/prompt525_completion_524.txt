  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because "get" is a method that returns the value of a property, while "op" is a property that represents the operation to be performed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set"
```
This would result in different behavior because "set" is a method that sets the value of a property, while "op" is a property that represents the operation to be performed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post"
```
This would result in different behavior because "post" is a method that applies a promised function, while "op" is a property that represents the operation to be performed.

DONE.
