  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value, and would not throw an error as the original code would have.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a valid value, and would not throw an error as the original code would have.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject("error message"), null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject` would throw an error, and would not be caught by the original code as it only catches errors for `Promise.resolve`.

DONE.
