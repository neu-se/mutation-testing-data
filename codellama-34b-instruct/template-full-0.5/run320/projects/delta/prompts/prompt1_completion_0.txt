  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a == null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` and `undefined` are not the same thing in JavaScript. The original code fragment checks if `a` is not an object, but `null` is considered an object in JavaScript.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value, unlike `null`, which is an object. The original code fragment checks if `a` is not an object, but `undefined` is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a != null
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is not an object if it is `null` or `undefined`. The original code fragment checks if `a` is not an object, but `null` and `undefined` are not objects.

DONE.
