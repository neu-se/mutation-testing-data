  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0 instead of considering the value of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (b < 0) {
  return NaN;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `NaN` if `b` is less than 0, instead of considering the value of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a = 10;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set `a` to 10, regardless of the value of `this['re']`.

DONE.
