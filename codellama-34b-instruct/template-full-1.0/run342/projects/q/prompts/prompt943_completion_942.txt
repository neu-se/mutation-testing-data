  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null, value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` would be called with `null` as the context, which is not the intended behavior. The original code fragment `defer` was called without any arguments, which means it would be called with the default context `defer`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` would be called even if the promise resolves, which is not the intended behavior. The original code fragment `defer` was only called in the case of rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` would be called even if the promise rejects, which is not the intended behavior. The original code fragment `defer` was only called in the case of rejection.

DONE.
