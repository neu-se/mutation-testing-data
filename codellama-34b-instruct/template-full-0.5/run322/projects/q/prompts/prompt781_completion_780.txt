  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
regardless()
```
This would result in different behavior because `regardless` is a function that is not defined in the code snippet, and it would cause a `ReferenceError` when called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `void(0)` is a statement that does nothing, and it would cause the promise to resolve with `undefined` instead of the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to reject with a new error instead of the expected value.

DONE.
