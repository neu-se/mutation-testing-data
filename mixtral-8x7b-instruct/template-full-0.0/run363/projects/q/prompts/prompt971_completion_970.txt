 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array is truthy, which changes the behavior of the `Q.nmapply` function. The original code fragment `args` is passed as the second argument to `Q(object).dispatch("post", [...])`, which expects an array of arguments including the callback. An empty array would cause the `post` method to receive an incorrect number of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, which changes the behavior of the `Q.nmapply` function. The original code fragment `args` is passed as the second argument to `Q(object).dispatch("post", [...])`, which expects an array of arguments including the callback. Passing `null` instead would cause the `post` method to receive fewer arguments than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ length: 0 }
