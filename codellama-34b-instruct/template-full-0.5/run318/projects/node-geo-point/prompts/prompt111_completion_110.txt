  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan(coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 180) - 1 / Math.cos(coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 180)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the sign of the result, causing the calculation to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan(coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 180) * 2 / Math.cos(coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 180)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the result of the calculation, causing the final value to be larger.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan(coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 180) + Math.PI / Math.cos(coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 180)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the value
