Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
';'
```
This would result in different behavior because using a semicolon as a delimiter would cause the `buffer.split(';')` to not correctly separate the rows, leading to incorrect parsing of the data and potentially causing the application to fail to load valid entries.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
','
```
This would result in different behavior because using a comma as a delimiter would incorrectly split the JSON strings, which are expected to be separated by newlines, resulting in malformed data being processed and potentially causing errors during JSON parsing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\r\n'
```
This would result in different behavior because using a carriage return followed by a newline as a delimiter would not match the expected newline character in the data, leading to rows not being split correctly and potentially causing the application to misinterpret the data structure.

DONE.
