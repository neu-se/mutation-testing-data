  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This change will cause the `op` function to receive `null` as its argument, which may cause it to behave differently than when it receives the `data` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This change will cause the `op` function to receive `undefined` as its argument, which may cause it to behave differently than when it receives the `data` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This change will cause the `op` function to receive `0` as its argument, which may cause it to behave differently than when it receives the `data` argument.

DONE.
