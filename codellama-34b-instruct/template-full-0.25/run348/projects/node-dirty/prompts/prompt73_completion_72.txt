  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code === 'EACCES'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for a different error code, specifically "EACCES" instead of "ENOENT".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code !== 'ENOENT'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for any error code other than "ENOENT", instead of specifically checking for "ENOENT".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code === 'ENOENT' && this.path.startsWith('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for the "ENOENT" error code and also check if the path starts with a forward slash, which would result in a different outcome than just checking for the error code.

DONE.
