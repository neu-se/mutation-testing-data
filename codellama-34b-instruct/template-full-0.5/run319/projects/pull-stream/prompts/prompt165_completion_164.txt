  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is calling the `abortCb` function, which is passed as an argument to the `values` function. Replacing it with `null` would cause the function to return `null` instead of calling the `abortCb` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the `abort` argument is truthy. Replacing it with `undefined` would cause the function to return `undefined` instead of calling the `abortCb` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is calling the `abortCb` function, which is passed as an argument to the `values` function. Replacing it with an arrow function that returns an empty object would cause the function to return an empty object instead of calling
