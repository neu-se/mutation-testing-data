  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.foo
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx.foo` is not a valid property of the `ctx` object, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.bar
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx.bar` is not a valid property of the `ctx` object, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.baz
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx.baz` is not a valid property of the `ctx` object, and would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
