  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the promise is rejected, whereas the original code fragment checks if the promise is fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the promise is pending, whereas the original code fragment checks if the promise is fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the promise is fulfilled, whereas the original code fragment checks if the promise is rejected.

DONE.
