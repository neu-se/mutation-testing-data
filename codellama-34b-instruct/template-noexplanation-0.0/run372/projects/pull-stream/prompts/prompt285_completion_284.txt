  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This code fragment is a buggy version of the original code, as it passes `null` as the first argument to the `cb` function, which is not the expected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(data, null)
```
This code fragment is another buggy version of the original code, as it passes `null` as the second argument to the `cb` function, which is not the expected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(data)
```
This code fragment is a buggy version of the original code, as it passes only one argument to the `cb` function, which is not the expected behavior.

DONE.
