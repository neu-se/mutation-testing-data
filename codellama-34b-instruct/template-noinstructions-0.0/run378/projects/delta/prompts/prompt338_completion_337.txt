  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseIndex` variable is used to keep track of the current position in the `base` Delta, and incrementing it by 1 would cause the `slice` method to start at the wrong position.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseIndex` variable is used to keep track of the current position in the `base` Delta, and decrementing it by 1 would cause the `slice` method to start at the wrong position.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseIndex` variable is used to keep track of the current position in the `base` Delta, and adding the `length` of the current operation to it would cause the `slice` method to start at the wrong position.

DONE.
