Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Invalid input");
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of calling `parser_exit()`, which presumably handles the error gracefully, this code will throw an uncaught error, potentially crashing the program if not caught.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return { 're': 0, 'im': 0 };
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of exiting the parser, this code will return a complex number with both real and imaginary parts set to zero, which may lead to incorrect results in subsequent calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("Invalid token encountered");
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of terminating the parsing process, this code will log a message to the console and continue execution, potentially leading to further errors or unexpected behavior in the program.

DONE.
