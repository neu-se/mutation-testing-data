  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.delete` is a number, while this replacement checks if it is `undefined`. If `op.delete` is a number, the replacement would return `false`, while the original code would return `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.delete` is a number, while this replacement checks if it is `null`. If `op.delete` is a number, the replacement would return `false`, while the original code would return `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.delete` is a number, while this replacement checks if it is a string. If `op.delete` is a number, the replacement would return `false`, while the original
