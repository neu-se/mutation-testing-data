  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `messages.length` would always be truthy, even if the promise has been resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `messages.length === 0` would only be truthy if the promise has been resolved and there are no more messages to process.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolvedPromise` would be truthy if the promise has been resolved, regardless of the length of the `messages` array.

DONE.
