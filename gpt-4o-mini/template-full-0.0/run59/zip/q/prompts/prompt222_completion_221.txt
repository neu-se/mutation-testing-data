Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.prototype = {};
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the prototype of the `defer` function to an empty object, which would break the inheritance chain and potentially lead to runtime errors when methods are called on the deferred object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.prototype = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because setting the prototype to `null` would remove all inherited properties and methods from the `defer` function, causing any calls to prototype methods to fail, leading to unexpected behavior in promise handling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.prototype = Promise.prototype;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the `defer` function inherit directly from `Promise.prototype`, which could lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior if the `defer` function is expected to have its own distinct behavior separate from standard Promise methods.

DONE.
