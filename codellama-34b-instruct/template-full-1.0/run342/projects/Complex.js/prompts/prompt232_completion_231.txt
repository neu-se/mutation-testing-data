  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1/Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the square root function from the Math library, while the replaced code fragment is using the reciprocal of the square root function. The square root function returns the positive square root of a number, while the reciprocal of the square root function returns the negative square root of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(a, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the square root function, which always returns a positive value, while the replaced code fragment is using the pow function with a power of 2, which can return a negative value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a/b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the square root function, which always returns a positive value, while the replaced code fragment is using the division operator, which can return a negative value if the denomin
