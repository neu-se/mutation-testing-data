  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value associated with the key, rather than the key itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value associated with the key that is one greater than the original key, rather than the original key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value associated with the key plus one, rather than the original key.

DONE.
