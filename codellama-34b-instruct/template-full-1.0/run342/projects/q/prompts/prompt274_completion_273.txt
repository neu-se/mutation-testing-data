  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(PLACEHOLDER)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of the expression, so even if the promise is rejected, it would still be considered resolved in the sense that the `resolvedPromise` variable would be truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
~(PLACEHOLDER)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `~` operator performs a bitwise NOT operation on the expression, which would result in a different value than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(PLACEHOLDER + 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would convert the value of the expression to a number, which could result in a different value than the original code fragment.

DONE.
