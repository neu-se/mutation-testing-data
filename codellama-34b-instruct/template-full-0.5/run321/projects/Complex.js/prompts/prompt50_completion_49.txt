  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `arg` property instead of the `abs` property, which could lead to errors in the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['abs'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the `abs` property, which could lead to errors in the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['abs'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the `abs` property by 2, which could lead to errors in the calculation.

DONE.
