 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function is not called, and the `deferred.promise` will not be created correctly. The `Promise.resolve()` creates a resolved promise, but it does not behave like the `defer` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function expects a callback function as its argument, but it is called with `null`. This would cause the deferred object to be created without a promise, which may lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.defer().resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function is called, but its returned deferred object's promise is immediately resolved. This would cause the `all` function to resolve prematurely, even if not all the input promises have resolved yet.
