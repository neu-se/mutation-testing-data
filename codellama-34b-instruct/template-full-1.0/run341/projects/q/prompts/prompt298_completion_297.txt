  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to resolve immediately, even if the operation was not completed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected, even if the operation was completed successfully.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nextTick(function() {});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved on the next tick of the event loop, rather than immediately.

DONE.
