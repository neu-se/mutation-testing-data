  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator)()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `makeGenerator` function immediately, rather than waiting for the next tick of the event loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator).call()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `makeGenerator` function immediately, rather than waiting for the next tick of the event loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator).apply()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `makeGenerator` function immediately, rather than waiting for the next tick of the event loop.

DONE.
