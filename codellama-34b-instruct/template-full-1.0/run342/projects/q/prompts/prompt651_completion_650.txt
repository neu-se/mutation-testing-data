  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"put"
```
This would result in different behavior because "put" is not a valid method for a promise, whereas "post" is a method that can be used to post a message to a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because "get" is not a valid method for a promise, whereas "post" is a method that can be used to post a message to a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set"
```
This would result in different behavior because "set" is not a valid method for a promise, whereas "post" is a method that can be used to post a message to a promise.

DONE.
