  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method expects a function as its argument, but `null` is being passed instead. This would cause an error to be thrown when the `makeNodeResolver` method is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method expects a function as its argument, but an empty function is being passed instead. This would cause the `makeNodeResolver` method to return a promise that is immediately resolved with the value `undefined`, rather than a promise that is resolved with the value returned by the `callback` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(function(error, result) {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method expects a function as its argument, but a function with two
