  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression === COMPRESSION_LEVEL.medium
```
This would result in different behavior because the compression level would be set to medium instead of uncompressed, which would result in a different compression ratio and potentially different file size.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression === COMPRESSION_LEVEL.high
```
This would result in different behavior because the compression level would be set to high instead of uncompressed, which would result in a different compression ratio and potentially different file size.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression === COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the compression level would be set to uncompressed instead of high, which would result in a different compression ratio and potentially different file size.

DONE.
