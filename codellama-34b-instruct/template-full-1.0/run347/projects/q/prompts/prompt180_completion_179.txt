  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(module.js"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "node.js:" string is no longer present in the stack trace line, and the line now contains the "module.js" string instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(node.js:12345"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "module.js" string is no longer present in the stack trace line, and the line now contains the "node.js:12345" string instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(module.js:12345)"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "node.js" string is no longer present in the stack trace line, and the line now contains the "module.js:12345" string instead.

DONE.
