 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.delay` function would immediately reject the promise with a `TypeError`: "Cannot read property 'then' of null".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.delay` function would immediately reject the promise with a `TypeError`: "this.then is not a function".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'string'
