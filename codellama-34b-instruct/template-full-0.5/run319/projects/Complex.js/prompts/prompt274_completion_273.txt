  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'], this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments are swapped, which would cause the function to return the wrong value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments are added together, which would cause the function to return a value that is not a complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments are multiplied together, which would cause the function to return a value that is not a complex number.

DONE.
