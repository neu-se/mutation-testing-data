  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.promiseDispatch.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a different method than `apply`, and it would change the way the function is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.promiseDispatch.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a bound context, whereas `apply` and `call` simply call the function with a specific context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.promiseDispatch.apply(null, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the context of the function call to `null`, which could potentially cause errors if the function relies on the context being a promise.

DONE.
