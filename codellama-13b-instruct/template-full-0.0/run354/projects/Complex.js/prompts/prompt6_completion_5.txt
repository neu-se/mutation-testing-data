  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a unary minus operator, which negates the value of `x`. Replacing it with `x` would result in a positive value, which could cause issues in certain scenarios.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a unary minus operator, which negates the value of `x`. Replacing it with `-x` would result in a negative value, which could cause issues in certain scenarios.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a unary minus operator, which negates the value of `x`. Replacing it with `x * 2` would result in a positive value that is twice the original value, which could cause issues in certain scenarios.

DONE.
