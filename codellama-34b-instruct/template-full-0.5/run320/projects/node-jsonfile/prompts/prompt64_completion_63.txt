  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'utf16'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Buffer.toString()` method would use a different encoding, which could result in a different string being produced.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'utf32'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Buffer.toString()` method would use a different encoding, which could result in a different string being produced.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'ascii'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Buffer.toString()` method would use a different encoding, which could result in a different string being produced.

DONE.
