  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unique(field, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unique` function would return `false` instead of `true`, which would cause the `nonUnique` function to always return `field`, regardless of whether it has been seen before.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field = unique(field, false)
return field
```
This would result in different behavior because the `field` variable would be reassigned to the result of the `unique` function, and the `nonUnique` function would return the reassigned `field` variable, instead of the original `field` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return !unique(field, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nonUnique` function would return the negation of the result of the `unique` function, instead of the result itself.

DONE.
