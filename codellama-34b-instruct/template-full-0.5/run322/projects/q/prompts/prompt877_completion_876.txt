  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first argument in the `args` array, which could cause the function to fail or produce unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat(["extra argument"])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra argument to the `args` array, which could cause the function to fail or produce unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a null value as the `args` argument, which could cause the function to fail or produce unexpected results.

DONE.
