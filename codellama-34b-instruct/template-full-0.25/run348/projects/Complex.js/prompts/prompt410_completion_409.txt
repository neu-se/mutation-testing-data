  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
noIM = false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `noIM` variable is used to determine whether the complex number has an imaginary part, and setting it to `false` would cause the code to execute the `else` branch, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
noIM = true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `noIM` variable is used to determine whether the complex number has an imaginary part, and setting it to `true` would cause the code to execute the `if` branch, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
noIM = !noIM
```
This would result in different behavior because the `noIM` variable is used to determine whether the complex number has an imaginary part, and negating its value would cause the code to execute the opposite branch, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
