  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is a special object that is only available within the scope of a function, and it contains the values of the arguments passed to that function. Replacing it with `null` would result in an error because `null` is not a function, and it does not have an `arguments` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is a special object that is only available within the scope of a function, and it contains the values of the arguments passed to that function. Replacing it with `undefined` would result in an error because `undefined` is not a function, and it does not have an `arguments` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return arguments; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is a special object that is only available within the scope of a function
