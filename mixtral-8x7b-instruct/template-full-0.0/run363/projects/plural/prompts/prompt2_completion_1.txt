 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
10
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return a different substring, changing the type string returned by the `type` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'[object '
```
This would result in different behavior because the `type` function would return a string that doesn't match any of the expected type strings, causing the `plural` function to always append an "s" to the input word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.prototype.toString
