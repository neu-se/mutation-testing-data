  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` checks if a value is the special `NaN` (Not a Number) value, while `!isNaN` checks if a value is not `NaN`. This would cause the code to behave differently when the value is `NaN`, as it would be considered a valid value instead of an invalid one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` checks if a value is a finite number, while `isNaN` checks if a value is the special `NaN` value. This would cause the code to behave differently when the value is `NaN`, as it would be considered a valid value instead of an invalid one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` checks if a value is a finite number, while `!isFinite` checks if a value is
