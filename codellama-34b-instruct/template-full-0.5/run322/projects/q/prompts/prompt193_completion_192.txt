  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `attempt3` is an array and `attempt3[1]` would refer to the second element in the array, which may not exist.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `attempt3.length` would refer to the length of the array, which may be different from the index of the element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `attempt3[0]` would refer to the first element in the array, which may not be the desired element.

DONE.
