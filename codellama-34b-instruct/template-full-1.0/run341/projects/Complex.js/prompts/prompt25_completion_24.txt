  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a + b * b` would always be positive, whereas `1 + b * b` could be negative if `a` is negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 2 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a + 2 * b` would always be greater than `1 + b * b` when `b` is positive, and vice versa.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `a - 1` would always be smaller than `1 + b * b` when `b` is positive, and vice versa.

DONE.
