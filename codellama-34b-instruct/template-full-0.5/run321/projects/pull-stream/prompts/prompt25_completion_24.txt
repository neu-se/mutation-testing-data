  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[1], ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, which could cause the function to produce a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument is now being passed as the second argument, which could cause the function to produce a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because an additional argument is being passed, which could cause the function to produce a different output.

DONE.
