  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options` object is not guaranteed to have a `deprecated` property, and accessing it could result in a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options` object is not guaranteed to be null, and accessing it could result in a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options` object is not guaranteed to be undefined, and accessing it could result in a runtime error.

DONE.
