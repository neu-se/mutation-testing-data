  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attr[key] !== base[key] || base[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator will return `true` if either of the operands is `true`, whereas the `&&` operator will return `true` only if both operands are `true`. This means that the original code fragment will only return `true` if both `attr[key] !== base[key]` and `base[key] === undefined` are `true`, whereas the modified code fragment will return `true` if either of these conditions is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attr[key] === base[key] && base[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, whereas the `!==` operator checks for inequality. This means that the original code fragment will return `true` if `attr[key]` and `base[key]` are not equal, whereas the modified code fragment will return `true` if `attr
