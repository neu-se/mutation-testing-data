  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `isEqual` function, causing the `if` statement to execute the opposite branch.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNotEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNotEqual` is not a valid function, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isEqual(otherOp.retain, thisOp.retain)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the `retain` property of `otherOp` to the `retain` property of `thisOp`, rather than comparing the `retain` property of `otherOp` to `null`.

DONE.
