Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.insert === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `nextOp.insert` is a string instead of checking if `nextOp.delete` is a number, which could lead to returning an incorrect operation type when `nextOp` does not have a `delete` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.delete === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `nextOp.delete` is `undefined` rather than verifying if it is a number, which would cause the condition to evaluate to true even when `nextOp.delete` is a number, leading to incorrect operation handling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.retain === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `nextOp.retain` is `null` instead of checking if `nextOp.delete` is a number, which would incorrectly classify operations that should be treated as deletions.

DONE.
