Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"@!"
```
This would result in different behavior because the modified string will not match the expected format for stack traces, potentially causing the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function to fail to extract the filename and line number correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"~"
```
This would result in different behavior because using a different character will change the expected format of the stack trace, leading to incorrect parsing in the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function, which may return `null` instead of the expected filename and line number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"@filename"
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of "filename" will alter the expected stack trace format, causing the regex in `getFileNameAndLineNumber` to fail to match, which would prevent the correct extraction of the file name and line number.

DONE.
