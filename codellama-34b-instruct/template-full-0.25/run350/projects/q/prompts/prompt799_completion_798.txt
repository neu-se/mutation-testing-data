  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` method expects a function as its second argument, but `null` is not a function and would cause the method to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` method expects a function as its second argument, but `undefined` is not a function and would cause the method to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` method expects a function as its second argument, but `function () {}` is a function that does nothing and would cause the method to do nothing instead of calling the `progressed` callback.

DONE.
