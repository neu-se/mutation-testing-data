  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment subtracts 2 from the length of the word, while this new code fragment subtracts 1. This would cause the plural form of words that end in "us" to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment subtracts 2 from the length of the word, while this new code fragment adds 1. This would cause the plural form of words that end in "us" to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment subtracts 2 from the length of the word, while this new code fragment multiplies the length by 2. This would cause the plural form of words that end in "us" to be incorrect.

DONE.
