  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '-'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the presence of a plus sign, while this replacement checks for the presence of a minus sign.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '*'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the presence of a plus sign, while this replacement checks for the presence of a multiplication sign.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the presence of a plus sign, while this replacement checks for the presence of a division sign.

DONE.
