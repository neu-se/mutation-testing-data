  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
globPart.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first character of the glob pattern, potentially matching a different set of files.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
globPart.replace('*', '?')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the wildcard character '*' with the character '?', which would match a different set of files.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
globPart.split(',').reverse().join(',')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the glob patterns, potentially matching a different set of files.

DONE.
