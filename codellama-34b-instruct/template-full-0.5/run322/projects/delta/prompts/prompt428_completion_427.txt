  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.retain` can be an object, and `null` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.retain` can be an object, and `null` is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.retain` can be an object, and `typeof` would return `'object'` for an object.

DONE.
