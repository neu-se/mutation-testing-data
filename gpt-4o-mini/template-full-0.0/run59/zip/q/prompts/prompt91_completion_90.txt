Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` modifies the original array and returns the removed elements, while `slice` returns a shallow copy of a portion of the array without modifying the original.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` creates a new array by combining the original array with other arrays or values, whereas `slice` returns a shallow copy of a specified section of the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` adds one or more elements to the end of the array and returns the new length of the array, while `slice` returns a new array containing a portion of the original array without modifying it.

DONE.
