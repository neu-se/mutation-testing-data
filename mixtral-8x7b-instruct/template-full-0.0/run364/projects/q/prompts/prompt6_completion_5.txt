 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the CommonJS module exports would always be assigned the Q API, regardless of the actual existence of the `exports` and `module` objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the Q API would not be assigned as a module export, and the Q global would not be created when the script is executed in a CommonJS, NodeJS, or RequireJS environment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"undefined" === typeof exports
```
This would result in different behavior because the Q API would not be assigned as a module export if the `exports` variable is defined, even if it is not an object. This could potentially cause issues in environments that use the `exports` variable for other purposes.

DONE.
