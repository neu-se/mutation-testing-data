  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` and `b` are different variables.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt(b)` would return the square root of `b`, which may be different from `b` if `b` is not positive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.im
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.im` would refer to the imaginary part of the complex number, which may be different from `b` if the complex number is not purely real.

DONE.
