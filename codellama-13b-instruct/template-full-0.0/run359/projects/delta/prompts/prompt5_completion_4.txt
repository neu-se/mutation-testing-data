  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keepNull
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keepNull` variable is not defined in the original code, and therefore the `compose` function would always return `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!keepNull
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!keepNull` expression would always evaluate to `true`, and therefore the `compose` function would always return the `b` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keepNull && !keepNull
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keepNull` variable is not defined in the original code, and therefore the `compose` function would always return `undefined`.

DONE.
