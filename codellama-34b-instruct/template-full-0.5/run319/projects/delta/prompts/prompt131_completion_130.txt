  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push(nextOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nextOp` variable is not defined in the scope of the `slice` method, and therefore would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push(this.ops[index]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` variable is not defined in the scope of the `slice` method, and therefore would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push(other.ops[index]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `other` variable is not defined in the scope of the `slice` method, and therefore would cause an error.

DONE.
