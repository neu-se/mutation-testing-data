 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for explicit equality with `undefined` instead of using the "not truthy" check, potentially allowing objects with falsy values (e.g., `{}`, `[]`, `0`, `''`) to pass the condition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'country' in result
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the existence of the `country` key in the `result` object, rather than checking the value associated with that key. This would allow any object with a `country` key to pass the condition, even if its value is not an empty array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(result, country)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `hasOwnProperty` method to check for the existence of the `country` key in the `result` object, rather than directly
