  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `isInfinite()` method on the `this` object, which may not have the same behavior as the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'] = true;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `isInfinite` property of the `this` object to `true`, which may not have the same behavior as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'] = false;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `isInfinite` property of the `this` object to `false`, which may not have the same behavior as the original code.

DONE.
