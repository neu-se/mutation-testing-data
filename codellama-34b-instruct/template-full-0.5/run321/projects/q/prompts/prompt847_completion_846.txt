  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.timeout` expects the first argument to be a promise, but `null` is not a promise and will cause the function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.timeout` expects the first argument to be a promise, but `undefined` is not a promise and will cause the function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.timeout` expects the first argument to be a promise, but `0` is not a promise and will cause the function to throw an error.

DONE.
