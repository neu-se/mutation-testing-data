  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the second element of the `ref` array instead of the first.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different value to the `pull` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different value to the `pull` function and would likely cause an error.

DONE.
