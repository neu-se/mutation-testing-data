  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first character of the `data` string, rather than the entire string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `data` string starting from the second character, rather than the entire string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `data` string in uppercase, rather than the original case.

DONE.
