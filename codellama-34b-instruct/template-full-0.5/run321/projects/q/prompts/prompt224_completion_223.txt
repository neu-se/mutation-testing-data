  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype` is a different object than `Promise.prototype`, and would therefore change the behavior of the `promiseDispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.prototype.constructor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.prototype.constructor` is a different function than `Promise.prototype`, and would therefore change the behavior of the `promiseDispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an object, and would therefore cause the `promiseDispatch` method to throw an error.

DONE.
