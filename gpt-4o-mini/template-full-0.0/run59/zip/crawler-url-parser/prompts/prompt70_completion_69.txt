Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
require('cheerio').load
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the way the `cheerio` module is imported, potentially leading to issues if the module is not properly required or if the context of the `load` function is altered.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('html')
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly selects the `<html>` element instead of loading the provided HTML string, which would not allow for parsing the actual content of the `data` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cheerio.parseHTML(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `parseHTML` does not return a Cheerio instance but rather an array of DOM elements, which would not support the jQuery-like syntax used later in the code (e.g., `$('a').each(...)`).

DONE.
