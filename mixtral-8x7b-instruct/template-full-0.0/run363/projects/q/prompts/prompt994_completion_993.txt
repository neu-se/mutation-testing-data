 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
defer(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer(<PLACEHOLDER>)` would now be `defer(undefined)`, which would cause the deferred object to not track any node resolver. This could lead to issues with promise resolution or rejection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
defer({});
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer(<PLACEHOLDER>)` would now be `defer({})`, which would create a deferred object with an empty object as its resolver. This could cause the promise to never resolve or reject, as the resolver object does not have the necessary methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
defer(function () {});
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer(<PLACEHOLDER>)` would now be `defer(function () {})`, which would create a deferred object with a function as its resolver
