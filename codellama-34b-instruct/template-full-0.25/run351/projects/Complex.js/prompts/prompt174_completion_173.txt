  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0 !== d
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `d` is equal to 0, while the new code fragment checks if `d` is not equal to 0. This change would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `d` is not equal to 0, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `d` is equal to 0, while the new code fragment checks if `d` is not equal to 0. This change would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `d` is not equal to 0, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `d` is not equal to
