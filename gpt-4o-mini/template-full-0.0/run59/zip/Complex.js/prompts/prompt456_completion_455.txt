Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the sum of the real and imaginary parts instead of checking if the complex number is NaN, leading to incorrect string representation for complex numbers that are NaN.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the product of the real and imaginary parts instead of checking for NaN, which would incorrectly indicate that a complex number is valid even if one of its components is NaN.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly check if the imaginary part is zero instead of checking if the complex number is NaN, potentially leading to a false representation of the complex number when it actually contains NaN values.

DONE.
