  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `data` object is not being accessed using the `key` variable, but rather using the `key` variable as a literal key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data[key + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key` variable is being incremented by 1, which would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data[key - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key` variable is being decremented by 1, which would cause the function to return a different value.

DONE.
