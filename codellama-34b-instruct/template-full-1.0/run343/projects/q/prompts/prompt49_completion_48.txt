  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (!domain) {
    throw new Error("No domain available");
}
domain.exit();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only exits the domain if it is non-null, while this modified code unconditionally exits the domain. If the domain is null, the modified code would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (!domain) {
    throw new Error("No domain available");
}
domain.enter();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only enters the domain if it is non-null, while this modified code unconditionally enters the domain. If the domain is null, the modified code would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (domain && !domain.isActive()) {
    throw new Error("Inactive domain");
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only throws an error if the domain is not active,
