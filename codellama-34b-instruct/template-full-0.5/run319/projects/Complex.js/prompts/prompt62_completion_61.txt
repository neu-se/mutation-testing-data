  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['theta']
```
This would result in different behavior because `a['theta']` is not defined, whereas `a['phi']` is defined as a property of the `a` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.theta
```
This would result in different behavior because `a.theta` is not defined, whereas `a['phi']` is defined as a property of the `a` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.phi
```
This would result in different behavior because `a.phi` is not defined, whereas `a['phi']` is defined as a property of the `a` object.

DONE.
