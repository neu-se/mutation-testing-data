  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function would return a different value than `cos`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.sin` function would return a different value than `cos`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return 0, regardless of the input.

DONE.
