  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `part_count_diff` variable is now being checked for a value greater than 1 instead of equal to -1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff < 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `part_count_diff` variable is now being checked for a value less than 1 instead of equal to -1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff != -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `part_count_diff` variable is now being checked for a value that is not equal to -1 instead of equal to -1.

DONE.
