 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => cb
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new function with no arguments, causing `cb` to always be `undefined` inside the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, acc)
```
This would result in different behavior because it immediately calls the callback with the accumulator value, instead of waiting for the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb.bind(null, err, acc)
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the `this` context of the callback to `null` and passes `err` and `acc` as arguments, which might cause issues if the callback expects a different context or arguments.

DONE.
