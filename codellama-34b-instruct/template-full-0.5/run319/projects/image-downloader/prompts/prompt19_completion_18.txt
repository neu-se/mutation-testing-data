  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isAbsolute(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path.isAbsolute()` function checks if the path is absolute, while the original code fragment checks if the path is not absolute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.startsWith('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `startsWith()` method checks if the string starts with the given substring, while the original code fragment checks if the path is not absolute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!path.isAbsolute(options.dest) && path.dirname(options.dest) !== '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path.dirname()` function returns the directory name of the path, while the original code fragment checks if the path is not absolute.

DONE.
