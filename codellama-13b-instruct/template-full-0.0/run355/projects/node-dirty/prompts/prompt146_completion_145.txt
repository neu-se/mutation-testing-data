  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'drain' event is emitted when the write stream is drained, while the 'close' event is emitted when the write stream is closed. In this case, the 'close' event would be emitted before the 'drain' event, which could cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'drain' event is emitted when the write stream is drained, while the 'error' event is emitted when an error occurs on the write stream. In this case, the 'error' event would be emitted before the 'drain' event, which could cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finish'
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'drain' event is emitted when the write stream is drained, while the 'finish' event is
