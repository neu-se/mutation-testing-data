  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a + 1` expression would always evaluate to a truthy value, even if `a` is `0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a - 1` expression would always evaluate to a falsy value, even if `a` is `1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a * 2` expression would double the value of `a`, which could result in a different outcome in the surrounding code.

DONE.
