  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function and would throw an error if called like a function, while `this.emit` is a function and would not throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function and would throw an error if called like a function, while `this.emit` is a function and would not throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `() => {}` is a function that does nothing when called, while `this.emit` is a function that emits an event when called.

DONE.
