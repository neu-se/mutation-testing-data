  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` and `delete` are inverse operations, so using `insert` instead of `delete` would cause the mutated code to behave in the opposite way than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` and `delete` are inverse operations, so using `retain` instead of `delete` would cause the mutated code to behave in the opposite way than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` and `delete` are not inverse operations, so using `push` instead of `delete` would cause the mutated code to behave differently than the original code.

DONE.
