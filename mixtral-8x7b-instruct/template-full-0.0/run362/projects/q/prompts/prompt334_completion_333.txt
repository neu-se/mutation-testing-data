 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `valueOf` and `exception` properties will not be set based on the promise's state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
inspect || function () { return {}; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` function might return an object with different properties, and the `valueOf` and `exception` properties will not be set correctly based on the promise's state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return { state: "unknown" }; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` function will always return an object with the `state` property set to "unknown", and the `valueOf` and `exception` properties will not be set based on the promise's state.

DONE.
