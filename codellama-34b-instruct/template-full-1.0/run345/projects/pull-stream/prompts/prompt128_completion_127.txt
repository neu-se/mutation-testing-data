  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `true` always evaluates to a truthy value, while `null` always evaluates to a falsy value, which means the behavior of the `if` statement that checks `end` would be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `true` always evaluates to a truthy value, while `false` always evaluates to a falsy value, which means the behavior of the `if` statement that checks `end` would be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `true` always evaluates to a truthy value, while `undefined` evaluates to a falsy value, which means the behavior of the `if` statement that checks `end` would be different.

DONE.
