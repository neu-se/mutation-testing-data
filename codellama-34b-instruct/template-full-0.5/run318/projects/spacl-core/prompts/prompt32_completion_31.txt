  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => acc + seg, '$'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the segments in the path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => seg + acc, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not include the '$' character at the end of the path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => acc + seg, '\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include a backslash character at the end of the path, which is not allowed in a path specification.

DONE.
