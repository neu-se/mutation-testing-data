  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.length <= 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow for the input array to have fewer than 2 elements, which would cause the parsing code to exit with an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.length >= 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow for the input array to have more than 2 elements, which would cause the parsing code to exit with an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a.length === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the length of the input array is a string, which would always be false and cause the parsing code to exit with an error.

DONE.
