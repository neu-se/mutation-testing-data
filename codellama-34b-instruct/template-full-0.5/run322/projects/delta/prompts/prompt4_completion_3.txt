  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the first argument, regardless of the values of the other arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b || a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the second argument if it is truthy, and the first argument otherwise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a && b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the second argument if the first argument is truthy, and the first argument otherwise.

DONE.
