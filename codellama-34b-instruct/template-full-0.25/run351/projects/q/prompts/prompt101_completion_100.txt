  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback(basis, this[index], index)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the callback function with the wrong number of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback(basis, this[index], index, this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the callback function with the wrong `this` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback(basis, this[index], index, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the callback function with the wrong number of arguments.

DONE.
