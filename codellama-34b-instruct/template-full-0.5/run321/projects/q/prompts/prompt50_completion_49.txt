  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flushing
```
This would result in different behavior because `flushing` is always truthy, while `!flushing` is always falsey.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!flushing && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `!flushing && false` is always falsey, while `!flushing` is always truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flushing || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `flushing || true` is always truthy, while `!flushing` is always falsey.

DONE.
