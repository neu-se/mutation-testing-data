  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sourceUrl.replace(/^https?:\/\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the protocol from the URL, while this new code fragment removes the protocol and the domain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sourceUrl.replace(/^https?:\/\/[^\/]+/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the protocol and the domain from the URL, while this new code fragment removes the protocol, the domain, and the first path segment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sourceUrl.replace(/^https?:\/\/[^\/]+/, '').replace(/\/[^\/]+$/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the protocol and the domain from the URL, while this new code fragment removes the protocol, the domain, the first path segment, and the last path segment.

DONE.
