  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the
second argument instead of the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the
first argument instead of the second.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return null
instead of a value.

DONE.
