  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name, args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because slicing the `args` array would result in a new array, causing the `name` parameter to be `undefined` which would throw an error when passed to `Q(object)` as it is not a valid argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args, name
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `name` as the first argument to `Q(object)` would result in a type error as `Q` expects the first argument to be a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name, args.concat([name])
```
This would result in different behavior because concatenating `name` to the end of the `args` array would result in a new array that is one element longer than the original `args` array.

DONE.
