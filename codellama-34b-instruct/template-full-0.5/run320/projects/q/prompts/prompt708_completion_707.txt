  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that returns a slice of an array, while `array_slice.bind(this)` would return a bound function that, when called, would return a slice of the array with `this` as the `this` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that returns a slice of an array, while `array_slice.call(this)` would return a slice of the array with `this` as the `this` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.apply(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that returns a slice of an array, while `array_slice.apply(this)` would return a slice of the array with `this` as the
