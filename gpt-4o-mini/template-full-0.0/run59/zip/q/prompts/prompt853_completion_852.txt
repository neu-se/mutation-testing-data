Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of clearing the timeout, it would set a new timeout, potentially leading to multiple timeouts being active simultaneously, which could cause unexpected behavior or memory leaks.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clearInterval
```
This would result in different behavior because `clearInterval` is intended to stop a recurring timer set by `setInterval`, not a one-time timer set by `setTimeout`, which would not affect the timeout created for the promise resolution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeoutId = null
```
This would result in different behavior because assigning `null` to `timeoutId` would not clear the timeout at all, leaving the timeout active and potentially causing the promise to resolve or reject after the specified delay, even if the promise was already fulfilled or rejected.

DONE.
