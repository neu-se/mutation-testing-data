  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * places
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b` variable is not related to the original logic, and it could cause the method to return a wrong result for certain input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['im']` is the imaginary part of the complex number, and it is not used in the original logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(this['re'] * places) / places
```
This would result in different behavior because the square root operation would change the result of the method for certain input.

DONE.
