Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === ' ' || c === '\t' || c === '\r'
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly treats carriage return characters (`\r`) as valid tokens, while the original code only considers space, tab, and newline characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === ' ' || c === '\t' || c === 'x'
```
This would result in different behavior because it allows the character 'x' to be treated as a whitespace character, which could lead to incorrect parsing of complex number strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === ' ' || c === '\t' || c === '0'
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly allows the character '0' to be treated as whitespace, which could disrupt the parsing logic and lead to incorrect results when processing numeric values.

DONE.
