  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```REJECT```
This would result in different behavior because ```REJECT``` does not return a value, but rather rejects the promise with an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```RESOLVE```
This would result in different behavior because ```RESOLVE``` does not return a value, but rather fulfills the promise with a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```THROW```
This would result in different behavior because ```THROW``` throws an exception and rejects the promise, while the original code fragment would not.

DONE.
