  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `!=` operator, which checks for both null and undefined, while the new code fragment only checks for null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert != undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `!=` operator, which checks for both null and undefined, while the new code fragment only checks for undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

DONE.
