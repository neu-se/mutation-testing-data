  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof bootstrap !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator would return "function" if `bootstrap` is a function, and "object" if it is an object. By negating the condition, the code would enter the `if` block if `bootstrap` is not a function, which could cause unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof bootstrap === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator would return "undefined" if `bootstrap` is not defined, and "function" if it is a function. By checking for "undefined", the code would enter the `if` block if `bootstrap` is not defined, which could cause unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof bootstrap === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator would return "object" if `bootstrap` is an object, and "function" if it is a function.
