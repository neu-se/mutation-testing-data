 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `[].slice` is the native Array.prototype.slice method, while `array_slice` is an undefined variable or function. This change would cause a ReferenceError, breaking the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` is a completely different function, used for rounding down to the nearest integer. This change would cause unexpected behavior in the code, as it would not properly slice the arguments array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function array_slice() { return []; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new function that always returns an empty array, instead of slicing the provided arguments array. This change would cause unexpected behavior in the code, as it would not properly handle the arguments passed to the `Q.nbind`, `Q.nmapply`, `Q.
