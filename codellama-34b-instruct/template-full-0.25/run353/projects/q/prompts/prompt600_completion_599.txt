  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + args
```
This would result in different behavior because `op` and `args` are not defined in the current scope, so the code would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op, args.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.length` would return the length of the `args` array, which may be different from the original `args` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op, args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.slice(1)` would return a new array containing all elements of `args` except the first one, which may be different from the original `args` object.

DONE.
