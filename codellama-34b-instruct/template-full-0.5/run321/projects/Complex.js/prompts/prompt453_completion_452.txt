  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] - this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be comparing the real part of the complex number with the imaginary part, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] - this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be comparing the imaginary part of the complex number with the real part, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] + this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be adding the real part of the complex number with the imaginary part, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
