  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$1')
```
This code fragment is a buggy version of the original code, as it uses the wrong variable name (`part` instead of `spec`).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$1')
```
This code fragment is a buggy version of the original code, as it uses the wrong variable name (`spec` instead of `part`).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$1')
```
This code fragment is a buggy version of the original code, as it uses the wrong variable name (`part` instead of `spec`).

DONE.
