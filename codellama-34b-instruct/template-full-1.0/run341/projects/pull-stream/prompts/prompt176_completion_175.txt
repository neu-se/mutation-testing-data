  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.length` would return the length of the array, whereas `array` would return the array itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `array[0]` would return the first element of the array, whereas `array` would return the array itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.splice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.splice(0, 1)` would remove the first element of the array and return an array with the remaining elements, whereas `array` would return the array itself.

DONE.
