  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(a[key] !== undefined && b[key] === undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would cause the result of the expression to be negated, meaning that the logic would be reversed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(a[key] !== undefined) || (b[key] === undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would cause the result of the expression to be true if either the left or right side of the operator is true, which would be different from the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] === undefined || b[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator would cause the result of the expression to be true if either the left or right side of the operator is undefined, which would be different from the original code.

DONE.
