  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `test` is truthy, while this replacement checks if it is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `test` is truthy, while this replacement checks if it is not equal to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `test` is truthy, while this replacement checks if it is not equal to `false`.

DONE.
