  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation operator `!` would result in the condition being evaluated as a truthy value, even if `test(data)` returns a falsy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `test(data + 1)` would return a different value than `test(data)` if `test` is a function that performs mathematical operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data.prop)
```
This would result in different behavior because `test(data.prop)` would return a different value than `test(data)` if `data` is an object with a `prop` property that has a different value than `data`.

DONE.
