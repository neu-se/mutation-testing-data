  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
((1 - d) * Math.sin(b)) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by 2 is not necessary and the parentheses are not needed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(Math.sin(b) * (d + 1)) / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by 2 is not necessary and the parentheses are not needed, also the order of operations is different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(Math.sin(b) * (d - 1)) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by 2 is not necessary and the parentheses are not needed, also the order of operations is different.

DONE.
