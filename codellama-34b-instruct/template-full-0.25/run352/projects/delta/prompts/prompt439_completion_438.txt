  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for both `number` and `object` types, while this replacement only checks for `number`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'object' && nextOp.retain === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for `object` and `null` types, while this replacement only checks for `object` and `null` types.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for `number`, `object`, and `null` types, while this replacement only checks for `string` type.

DONE.
