  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end - 1` expression would cause the function to return one less than the original `end` value, which could potentially cause the function to return an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end + 1` expression would cause the function to return one more than the original `end` value, which could potentially cause the function to return an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would cause the function to return `null` instead of the original `end` value, which could potentially cause the function to return an incorrect result.

DONE.
