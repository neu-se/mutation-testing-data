  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.call(this, ...arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` context of the generator function would be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error('Invalid generator function')).apply;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method of the promise object returned by `Q.reject` would be called, which would throw an error when the generator function is executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the generator function would return `undefined`, which would be different from the original behavior.

DONE.
