  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
errback
```
This would result in different behavior because `errback` is a function that handles errors, while `callback` is a function that handles successful results. Using `errback` instead of `callback` would cause the promise to be rejected, even if the operation was successful.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that rejects a promise, while `callback` is a function that handles successful results. Using `reject` instead of `callback` would cause the promise to be rejected, even if the operation was successful.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("test")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error, causing the promise to be rejected.

DONE.
