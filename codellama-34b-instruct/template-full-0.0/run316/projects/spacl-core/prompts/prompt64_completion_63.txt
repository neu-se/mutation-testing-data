  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.splice(0, 0, ...rules)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` adds elements to an array at a specific index, whereas `push` adds elements to the end of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.concat(rules)
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` returns a new array that is the result of merging the original array with the provided array, whereas `push` modifies the original array by adding the provided elements to the end.

DONE.
