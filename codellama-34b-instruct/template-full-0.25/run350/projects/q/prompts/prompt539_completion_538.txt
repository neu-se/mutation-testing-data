  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.all(array).then(function (array) {
    return fulfilled.apply(void 0, array);
}, rejected);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a promise for the return value of the generator or the first rejected promise among those yielded, whereas the original code would return a promise for the return value of the generator or the first rejected promise among those yielded, but would also propagate any errors that occur during the execution of the generator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.all(array).then(function (array) {
    return fulfilled.apply(void 0, array);
}, rejected).catch(function (error) {
    return rejected(error);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would catch any errors that occur during the execution of the generator and return a rejected promise with the error, whereas the original code would propagate any errors that occur during the execution of the generator.

Option 3: The PL
