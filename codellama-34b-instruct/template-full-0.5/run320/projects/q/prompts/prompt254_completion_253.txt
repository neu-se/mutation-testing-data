  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `message` variable is an array of arguments, and `0` is not a valid argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid argument for the `promiseDispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid argument for the `promiseDispatch` method.

DONE.
