  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.push(part.slice(0))
```
This would result in different behavior because `props.push(part.slice(0))` will always push the full string to the `props` array, regardless of whether it matches the `:-)` pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.push(part.toLowerCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because `props.push(part.toLowerCase())` would always push a lowercase version of the `part` string to the `props` array, which may not match the original string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.push(part.substr(1))
```
This would result in different behavior because `props.push(part.substr(1))` would always push the substring of `part` starting from the second character to the `props` array, which may not match the original string.

DONE.
