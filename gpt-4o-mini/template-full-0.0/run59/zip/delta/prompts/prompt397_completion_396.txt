Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(otherIter.next());
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of pushing the operation from `otherIter` to `delta`, it retains the operation, which may lead to a loss of the intended insert operation and potentially alter the final output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(thisIter.next());
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the operation from `thisIter` instead of `otherIter`, which would incorrectly apply the operation from the current instance rather than the one being transformed, leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete(otherIter.next());
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to delete the operation from `otherIter`, which is not the intended action and would result in removing data instead of adding it, thus altering the structure of the `delta` object incorrectly.

DONE.
