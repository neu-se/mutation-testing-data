 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'bacteria', 'bacterium'
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the original match and result, causing incorrect plurals for 'bacteria' and 'bacterium'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'bacterium', function(w) { return w + 'a' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it always appends 'a' instead of correctly handling the plural form of 'bacterium'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/[^aeiou]a$|qua$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ae' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a new rule that is not present in the original code, affecting words ending in 'a' or 'qua'.

DONE.
