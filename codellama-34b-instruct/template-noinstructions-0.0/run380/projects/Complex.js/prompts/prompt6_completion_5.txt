  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the absolute value of `x`, which is not the same as negating `x`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the absolute value of `x`, which is not the same as simply using `x`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the absolute value of `x`, which is not the same as negating `x`.

DONE.
