  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = verbs[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the second verb in the list, regardless of whether it matches the path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = verbs[Math.random() * verbs.length]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would randomly select a verb from the list, which may not match the path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = verbs[verbs.length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the last verb in the list, regardless of whether it matches the path.

DONE.
