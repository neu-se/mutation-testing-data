  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `bootstrap` function to be called with the argument `"promise"` and the `Q` object instead of the function `definition`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `bootstrap` function to be called with the argument `"promise"` and the `Q` object instead of the function `definition`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `bootstrap` function to be called with the argument `"promise"` and the `Q` object instead of the function `definition`.

DONE.
