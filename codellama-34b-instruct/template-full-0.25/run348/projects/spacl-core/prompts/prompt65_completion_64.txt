  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...this.rules.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` creates a shallow copy of the array, whereas the original code fragment creates a new array by spreading the elements of the `rules` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...this.rules.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat()` creates a new array by concatenating the elements of the `rules` array with the elements of another array, whereas the original code fragment creates a new array by spreading the elements of the `rules` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...this.rules.filter(rule => rule.query(path, verb, ctx) === true)
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter()` creates a new array by filtering the elements of the `rules` array based on the result of the `query()` method, whereas the original code fragment creates a new array by spreading the elements of the `rules
