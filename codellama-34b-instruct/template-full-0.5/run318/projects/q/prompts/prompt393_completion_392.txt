  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` creates a rejected promise, whereas `Q` is a promise library.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve()` creates a resolved promise, whereas `Q` is a promise library.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all()` creates a promise that resolves when all promises in an array have resolved, whereas `Q` is a promise library.

DONE.
