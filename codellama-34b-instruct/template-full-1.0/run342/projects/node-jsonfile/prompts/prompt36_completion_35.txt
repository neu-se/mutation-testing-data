  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to read the file with a different encoding than the one specified in the options object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(options.encoding)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to parse the encoding value as JSON, which would likely throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.encoding = 'utf-8'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the encoding to a fixed value, rather than using the value provided in the options object.

DONE.
