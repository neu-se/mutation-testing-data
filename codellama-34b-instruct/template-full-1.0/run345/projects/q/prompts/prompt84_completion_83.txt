  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick();
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` is a function that needs to be called, whereas `requestTick` is not a function and will not be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick.bind(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` is a function and `bind` is used to create a copy of the function bound to a specific context, which is `undefined` in this case. This would change the behavior because `requestTick` is now bound to a different context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick.bind(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` is a function and `bind` is used to create a copy of the function bound to a specific context, which is `null` in this case. This would change the behavior because `requestTick` is now bound to a different context.
