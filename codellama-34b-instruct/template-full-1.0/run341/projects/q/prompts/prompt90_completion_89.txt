  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `uncurryThis` function would receive a `null` value as the first argument, which would lead to an error when `call.apply` is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `uncurryThis` function would receive an `undefined` value as the first argument, which would lead to an error when `call.apply` is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `uncurryThis` function would receive a random value as the first argument, which would lead to an error when `call.apply` is called with an invalid value.

DONE.
