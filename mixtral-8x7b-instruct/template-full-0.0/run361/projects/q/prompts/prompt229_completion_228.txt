 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array will be passed as the `operands` argument to the `promiseDispatch` method instead of the actual arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` will be passed as the `operands` argument to the `promiseDispatch` method instead of the actual arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object will be passed as the `operands` argument to the `promiseDispatch` method instead of the actual arguments. This could cause unexpected behavior as `arguments` may contain more or fewer elements than the actual arguments.

DONE.
