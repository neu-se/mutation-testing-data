 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve().then
```
This would result in different behavior because it always creates a new resolved promise, bypassing the original promise and any potential errors it may have.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.resolve().then
