  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value["apply"]
```
This would result in different behavior because the square bracket notation for property lookup ensures that the "apply" property is accessed by its string name, rather than the apply method being invoked as a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.post
```
This would result in different behavior because the post method is not defined on the value object, and would result in a TypeError at runtime.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.get(("apply"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the get method is not defined on the value object, and would result in a TypeError at runtime.

DONE.
