  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb && cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would not be called if it's not defined, whereas the original code would call `cb` even if it's not defined, which could lead to an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (cb) cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called only if it's defined, whereas the original code would call `cb` even if it's not defined, which could lead to an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (typeof cb === 'function') cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called only if it's a function, whereas the original code would call `cb` even if it's not a function, which could lead to an error.

DONE.
