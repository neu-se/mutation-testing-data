  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.retain` is a different operation than `thisOp.delete`, and it would change the way the code handles deletions in the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.insert` is a different operation than `thisOp.delete`, and it would change the way the code handles insertions in the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.length` is a different operation than `thisOp.delete`, and it would change the way the code handles the length of the delta.

DONE.
