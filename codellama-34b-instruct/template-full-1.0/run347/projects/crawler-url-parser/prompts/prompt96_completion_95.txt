  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```diff
- href, baseUrlStr
+ href || baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because `||` is a logical operator that returns the first truthy value in the list, so if `href` is not null, it will be returned and `baseUrlStr` will be ignored.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```diff
- href, baseUrlStr
+ href ?? baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because `??` is a nullish coalescing operator that returns the first non-nullish value in the list, so if `href` is null or undefined, `baseUrlStr` will be returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```diff
- href, baseUrlStr
+ href + baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because `+` is a string concatenation operator, so it will combine the `href` and `baseUrlStr` values into a single string.

DONE.
