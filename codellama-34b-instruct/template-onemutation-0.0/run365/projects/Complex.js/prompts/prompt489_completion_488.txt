  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ 'value': false }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` method would return `false` instead of `true`, which would cause the `isInfinite` method to return `false` instead of `true` when the complex number is at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere.
