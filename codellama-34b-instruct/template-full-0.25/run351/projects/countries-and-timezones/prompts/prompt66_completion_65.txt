  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` instead of the default value of `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the `deprecated` property to `true`, even if it was previously set to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = !options.deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because it would toggle the value of the `deprecated` property, so if it was previously `true`, it would become `false`, and if it was previously `false`, it would become `true`.

DONE.
