  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.assign({}, tzs[key])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.assign` returns a new object, while `{...tzs[key]}` returns a new object with the same properties as `tzs[key]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.assign(prev, { [key]: tzs[key] })
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.assign` mutates the `prev` object, while `{...tzs[key]}` returns a new object with the same properties as `tzs[key]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.assign(prev, { [key]: tzs[key] }, { deprecated: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.assign` returns a new object with the `deprecated` property set to `true`, while `{...tzs[key]}` returns a new object with the same properties as `tzs
