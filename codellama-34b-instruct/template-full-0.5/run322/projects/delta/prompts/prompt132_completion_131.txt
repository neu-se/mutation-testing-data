  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the value of the `insert` property of the `nextOp` object, rather than the `nextOp` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the value of the `attributes` property of the `nextOp` object, rather than the `nextOp` object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the value of the `retain` property of the `nextOp` object, rather than the `nextOp` object itself.

DONE.
