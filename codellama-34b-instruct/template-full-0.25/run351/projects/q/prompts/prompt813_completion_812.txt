  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {
    return value;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is not called with the correct number of arguments, which would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {
    return reason;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is not called with the correct number of arguments, which would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {
    throw reason;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is not called with the correct number of arguments, which would cause an error.

DONE.
