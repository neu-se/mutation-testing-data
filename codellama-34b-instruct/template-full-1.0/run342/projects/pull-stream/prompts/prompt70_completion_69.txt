  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op && false === op.call(this, data) || abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `call()` method to invoke the function `op` with the current stream as the `this` context, whereas the original code fragment uses the `op` function directly. This could cause the function to behave differently if it relies on the `this` context or if it modifies the stream in place.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op && false === op.apply(this, [data]) || abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `apply()` method to invoke the function `op` with the current stream as the `this` context and an array of arguments, whereas the original code fragment uses the `op` function directly. This could cause the function to behave differently if it relies on the `this` context or if it modifies the stream in place.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op && false === op
