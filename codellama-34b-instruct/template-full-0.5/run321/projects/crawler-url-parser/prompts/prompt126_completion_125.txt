  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(linkurl.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `parse` function on the `url` property of the `linkurl` object, which may not be the same as the original `linkurl` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(linkurl.href)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `parse` function on the `href` property of the `linkurl` object, which may not be the same as the original `linkurl` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(linkurl.pathname)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `parse` function on the `pathname` property of the `linkurl` object, which may not be the same as the original `linkurl` object.

DONE.
