  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort()
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort` is a function, and calling it would execute the function, whereas the original code fragment simply references the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort.call(this)` would execute the `onAbort` function with `this` set to the current object, whereas the original code fragment simply references the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort.bind(this)` would create a new function that, when called, would execute `onAbort` with `this` set to the current object, whereas the original code fragment simply references the function.

DONE.
