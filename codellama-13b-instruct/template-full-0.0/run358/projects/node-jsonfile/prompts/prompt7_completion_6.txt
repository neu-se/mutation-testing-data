  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fs.readFileSync` method is synchronous, whereas the original code uses the `fs.readFile` method which is asynchronous. This could cause issues if the code relies on the asynchronous behavior of `fs.readFile`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFile(file, options, (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    throw err;
  }
  return data;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function passed to `fs.readFile` is not the same as the one used in the original code. This could cause issues if the code relies on the specific behavior of the callback function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFile(file, options, (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    return null;
  }
  return data;
