Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `when` function to ignore any progress notifications, effectively making it impossible to handle progress updates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would lead to the same outcome as using `null`, causing the `when` function to disregard progress notifications, thus not invoking the `progressed` callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"notAFunction"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a string instead of a function, leading to a type error when the promise attempts to call the `progressed` callback, which would not be callable.

DONE.
