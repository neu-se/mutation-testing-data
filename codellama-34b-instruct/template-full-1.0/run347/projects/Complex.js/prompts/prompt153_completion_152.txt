  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['ZERO'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was designed to return `Complex['NAN']` when `z['isZero']` is true, but the replaced code fragment returns `Complex['ZERO']`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw Error('Zero is not a valid exponent.');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was designed to handle a zero exponent by returning `Complex['NAN']`, but the replaced code fragment throws an error when the exponent is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return z['pow'](a, b);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was designed to handle a zero exponent by returning `Complex['NAN']`, but the replaced code fragment uses the `pow` method of the `Complex` object with the same arguments, which could potentially return a different result.

DONE.
