  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i--)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i--` expression would decrement the value of `i` by 1, whereas the original code fragment `cb` simply calls the `cb` function without modifying `i`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true, i++)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i++` expression would increment the value of `i` by 1, whereas the original code fragment `cb` simply calls the `cb` function without modifying `i`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, max)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `max` variable is used as the second argument to the `cb` function, whereas the original code fragment `cb` simply calls the `cb` function without passing any arguments.

DONE.
