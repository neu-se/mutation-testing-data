  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { throw new Error("Unhandled rejection"); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an unhandled rejection error to be thrown if the promise is rejected, which would be detected by the unhandled rejection tracking code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return undefined; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the value `undefined` if it is rejected, which would be detected by the unhandled rejection tracking code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return null; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the value `null` if it is rejected, which would be detected by the unhandled rejection tracking code.

DONE.
