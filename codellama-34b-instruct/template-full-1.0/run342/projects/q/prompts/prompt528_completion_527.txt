  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Q(object.inspect)```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a promise that resolves to the return value of `inspect` method of `object`, whereas the original code fragment creates a promise that resolves to `object` itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Q(object).then(function(value) { return value.inspect; })```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a promise that resolves to the return value of `inspect` method of `object`, whereas the original code fragment creates a promise that resolves to `object` itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Q(object).then(function(value) { return value.inspect(); })```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a promise that resolves to the return value of `inspect` method of `object`, whereas the original code fragment creates a promise that resolves to `object` itself.

DONE.
