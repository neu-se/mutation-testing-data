  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow for the possibility of `b` being greater than 1, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `b` is not equal to 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b < 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow for the possibility of `b` being less than 1, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `b` is not equal to 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b != 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow for the possibility of `b` being any value other than 1, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `b` is equal to 1.

DONE.
