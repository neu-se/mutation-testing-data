  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys` returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property names, while `Object.values` returns an array of the given object's own enumerable property values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys` returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property names, while `Object.entries` returns an array of [key, value] pairs of the given object's own enumerable properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.getOwnPropertyNames()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys` returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property names, while `Object.getOwnPropertyNames()` returns an array of all own properties (including non-enumerable properties).

DONE.
