  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [nodeArgs, name]
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument order is reversed, which could cause the method to be called with the wrong arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, nodeArgs, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra `null` argument is being passed, which could cause the method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, nodeArgs, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra `undefined` argument is being passed, which could cause the method to behave differently.

DONE.
