Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the object is strictly equal to `null`, which would incorrectly classify `null` as a non-promise, while the original code checks if the object is an instance of `Promise`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof object === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the object is `undefined`, which would incorrectly classify `undefined` as a non-promise, while the original code checks for the instance of `Promise`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object instanceof Array
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the object is an instance of `Array`, which would incorrectly classify arrays as promises, while the original code checks for the instance of `Promise`.

DONE.
