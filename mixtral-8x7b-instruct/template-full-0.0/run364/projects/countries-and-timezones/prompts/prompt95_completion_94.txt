 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it specifically checks for the `null` value, whereas the original code checks for falsy values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(country).length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `country` object is empty, rather than checking if the `country` variable is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof country === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `country` is `undefined`, rather than checking if it's a falsy value.

DONE.
