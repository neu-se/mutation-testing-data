  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\n vs /* */\n'
```
This would result in different behavior because '\n' is a line break, while '/* */\n' is a comment with a line break.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'"' + String.fromCharCode(92, 110) + '"'
```
This would result in different behavior because '\"' is a single quote, while String.fromCharCode(92, 110) returns a carriage return, resulting in different behavior when concatenated with other characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'][['
```
This would result in different behavior because ']' is a syntax error, while '[[[' is not a syntax error, resulting in a valid JavaScript expression.

DONE.
