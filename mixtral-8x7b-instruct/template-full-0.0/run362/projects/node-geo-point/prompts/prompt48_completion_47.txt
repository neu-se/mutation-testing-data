 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan2(Math.sin(Δλ), Math.cos(φ1) * Math.tan(φ2) - Math.sin(φ1) * Math.cos(Δλ))
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a different formula for calculating the bearing, which may not provide accurate results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan2(Math.sin(Δλ) * Math.cos(φ2), Math.sin(φ2) * Math.cos(φ1) - Math.sin(φ1) * Math.cos(φ2) * Math.cos(Δλ))
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a different formula for calculating the bearing, which may not provide accurate results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan2(Math.sin(Δλ) * Math.cos(φ2), Math.sin(φ2
