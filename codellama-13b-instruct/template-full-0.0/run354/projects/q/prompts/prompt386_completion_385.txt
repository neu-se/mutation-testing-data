  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method is used instead of `fcall`, which would cause the callback function to be called with the global object as the `this` context, rather than the `this` context of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is used instead of `fcall`, which would cause the callback function to be called with the global object as the `this` context, rather than the `this` context of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method is used instead of `fcall`, which would cause the callback function to be called with the global object as the `this` context, rather than the `this` context of the promise.

DONE.
