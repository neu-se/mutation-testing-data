  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { throw new Error("rejected"); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas the original code would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return "fulfilled"; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the value "fulfilled", whereas the original code would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return "rejected"; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the value "rejected", whereas the original code would not.

DONE.
