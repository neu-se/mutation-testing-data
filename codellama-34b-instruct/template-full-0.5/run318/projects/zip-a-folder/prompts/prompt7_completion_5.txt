  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath + 'test'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append the string 'test' to the target file path, which would likely cause the archive to be written to a different location than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath.replace('zip', 'tar')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the string 'zip' in the target file path with 'tar', which would likely cause the archive to be written to a different location than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath.split('/').reverse().join('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the path segments in the target file path, which would likely cause the archive to be written to a different location than intended.

DONE.
