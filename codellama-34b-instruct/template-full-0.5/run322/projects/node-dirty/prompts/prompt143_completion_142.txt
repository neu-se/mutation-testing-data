  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error('Buggy error message')
```
This would result in different behavior because the new error message would be emitted, which would not be the case with the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be emitted as the error, which would not be the case with the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be emitted as the error, which would not be the case with the original code fragment.

DONE.
