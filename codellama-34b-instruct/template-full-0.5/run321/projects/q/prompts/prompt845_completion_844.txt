  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ms * 2, error
```
This would result in different behavior because the timeout would be increased by a factor of 2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ms / 2, error
```
This would result in different behavior because the timeout would be decreased by a factor of 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, error
```
This would result in different behavior because the timeout would be set to 0, causing the promise to be rejected immediately.

DONE.
