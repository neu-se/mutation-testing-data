  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {
    throw new Error("Simulated error");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a simulated error, whereas the original code would resolve the promise with the value of `promise`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {
    return Q.reject("Simulated rejection");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a simulated rejection, whereas the original code would resolve the promise with the value of `promise`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {
    return Q.delay(1000).then(function () {
        throw new Error("Simulated error after delay");
    });
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a simulated error after a
