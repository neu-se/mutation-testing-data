Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush(key);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the flush operation to be called with the key instead of the value, potentially leading to incorrect data being processed or saved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` would likely cause the flush operation to behave incorrectly, as it may not handle a null value properly, leading to unexpected results or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush(val);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the value instead of the key to the flush operation, which may not be the intended behavior and could lead to incorrect data being written to the database.

DONE.
