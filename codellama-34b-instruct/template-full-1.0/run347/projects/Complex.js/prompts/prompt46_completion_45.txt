  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a['re'] && a['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because 're' and 'im' are not properties in the original object, so the expression would evaluate to false, leading to different control flow.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a['re'] || a['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression would always evaluate to true when 're' or 'im' are not properties in the original object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(typeof a['re'] === 'number' && typeof a['im'] === 'number')
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression would always evaluate to false when 're' and 'im' are not properties in the original object, causing the parser to exit.

DONE.
