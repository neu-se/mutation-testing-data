  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses `array_slice(arguments, 2)` instead of `array_slice(arguments, 1)`. This will cause the `fcall` method to ignore the first argument passed to it, which may cause unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 3)]
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses `array_slice(arguments, 3)` instead of `array_slice(arguments, 1)`. This will cause the `fcall` method to ignore the first two arguments passed to it, which may cause unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 4)]
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses `array
