  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength()` returns the length of the next operation, while `peekType()` returns the type of the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the type of the next operation in the other iterator, rather than the current one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the lengths of the next operations in both iterators, rather than just the length of the next operation in the current iterator.

DONE.
