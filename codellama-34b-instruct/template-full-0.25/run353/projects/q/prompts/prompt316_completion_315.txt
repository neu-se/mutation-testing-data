  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect !== void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, so the code would enter the `if` block if `inspect` is not `undefined`, whereas the original code would enter the `if` block if `inspect` is `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, so the code would enter the `if` block if `inspect` is not `null`, whereas the original code would enter the `if` block if `inspect` is `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, so the code would enter the `if` block if `inspect` is not the string `"undefined"`, whereas the original code would enter the `if
