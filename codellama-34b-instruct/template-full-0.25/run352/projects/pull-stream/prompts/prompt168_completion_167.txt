  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `onAbort` is a function reference, while `onAbort()` is a function call. The function call would execute the function immediately, whereas the function reference would only be executed when the `abortCb` function is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `onAbort` is a function reference, while `onAbort.bind(this)` is a bound function reference. The bound function reference would execute the function with the `this` context set to the current object, whereas the function reference would execute the function with the `this` context set to the global object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `onAbort` is a function reference, while `on
