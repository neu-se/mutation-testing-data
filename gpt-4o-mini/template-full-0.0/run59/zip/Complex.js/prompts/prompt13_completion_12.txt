Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x < -b || x < b
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly checks if `x` is less than `-b` or less than `b`, which would allow values of `x` that are outside the intended range, leading to incorrect calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b <= x && x <= b
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `<=` and `>=` instead of `>` and `<`, which would include the boundary values `-b` and `b` in the valid range, potentially allowing values that should be considered invalid.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x == b || x == -b
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if `x` is exactly equal to `b` or `-b`, which would completely ignore any values of `x` that are within the range, leading to incorrect results for valid inputs.

DONE.
