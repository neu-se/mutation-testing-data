  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks the length of the current operation in the other iterated delta, while the replaced code checks the length of the current operation in the base iterated delta. 

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the length of the current operation in the other iterated delta, while the replaced code uses the type of the current operation in the other iterated delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the length of the current operation in the other iterated delta, while the replaced code uses the length of the current operation in the base iterated delta.

DONE.
