  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `Complex['NAN']` when both `this` and `z` are infinite, whereas the original code would return `Complex['INFINITY']` in this case.
