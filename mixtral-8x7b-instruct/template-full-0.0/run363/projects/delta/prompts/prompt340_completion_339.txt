 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
baseIndex + length
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `length` variable instead of a constant 1, potentially causing the `slice` method to slice more elements than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
baseIndex + Math.floor(Math.random() * length)
