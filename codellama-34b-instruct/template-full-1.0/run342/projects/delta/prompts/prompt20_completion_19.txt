  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` function to compare the `a` object with itself, rather than with the `b` object, which would always result in an empty diff object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` function to compare the `a` object with the negation of the `b` object, which would produce a different diff object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a || b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` function to compare the `a` object with the result of `a || b`, which would produce a different diff object.

DONE.
