  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
noop
```
This would result in different behavior because `noop` is a function that does nothing, whereas `runSingle` is a function that runs a single task in the async queue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw new Error()` would throw an error, whereas `runSingle` would run a single task in the async queue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a value that indicates that a variable has not been assigned a value, whereas `runSingle` is a function that runs a single task in the async queue.

DONE.
