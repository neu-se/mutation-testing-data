  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `if (this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()) { return Complex['NAN']; }`. This would result in different behavior because it would return `NaN` instead of `Infinity` if both `this` and `z` are infinite, which would cause the program to behave differently in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `if (this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()) { return Complex['ZERO']; }`. This would result in different behavior because it would return `0` instead of `Infinity` if either `this` or `z` is infinite, which would cause the program to behave differently in some cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `if (this['isInfinite']() && z['isFinite']()) { return Complex['INFINITY']; }`. This would result in different behavior because it would return `Infinity` instead of `NaN` if `this` is infinite and `z
