  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.resume(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `res.resume()`, which would consume the response data and free up memory, while the new code fragment would pass `null` to `res.resume()`, which would do nothing and the response data would not be consumed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.resume(res.statusCode);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `res.resume()`, which would consume the response data and free up memory, while the new code fragment would pass `res.statusCode` to `res.resume()`, which would consume the response data but would also throw an error because `res.statusCode` is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.resume(res.pipe);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `res.resume()`, which would consume the response
