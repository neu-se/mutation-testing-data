  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull.apply(null, ref)
```
This would result in different behavior because `pull.apply(null, ref)` would call the `pull` function with the arguments in the `ref` array, whereas the original code fragment `pull` would call the `pull` function with the arguments in the `args` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3])
```
This would result in different behavior because `pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3])` would call the `pull` function with the `read` argument and the first four elements of the `ref` array, whereas the original code fragment `pull` would call the `pull` function with the `read` argument and the first four elements of the `args` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[0], ref[1],
