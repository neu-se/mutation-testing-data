  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next operation is an insert, while the replaced code fragment checks if the next operation is not an insert. This change would cause the code to behave differently when the next operation is not an insert.

DONE.
