  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` will remove the key-value pair from the map, while `set` will update the value associated with the key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.clear
```
This would result in different behavior because `clear` will remove all key-value pairs from the map, while `set` will update the value associated with the key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key) = undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign `undefined` to the value associated with the key, while `set` will update the value associated with the key.

DONE.
