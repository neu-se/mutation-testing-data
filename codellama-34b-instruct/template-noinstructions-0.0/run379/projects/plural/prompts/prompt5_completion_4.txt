  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call.bind(Object.prototype.toString)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method creates a new function with a bound `this` value, which would cause the `toString` method to be called on a different object than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method creates a new function with a bound `this` value of `null`, which would cause the `toString` method to be called on a different object than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call.bind(Object.prototype)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method creates a new function with a bound `this` value of `Object.prototype`, which would cause the `toString` method to be called on a different object than the original code.
