  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regex is removed, causing the regex to match only lowercase "man" and "woman", but not "Man" or "Woman".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regex is added, causing the regex to match both lowercase and uppercase "man" and "woman".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regex is added, causing the regex to match both lowercase and uppercase "man" and "woman".

DONE.
