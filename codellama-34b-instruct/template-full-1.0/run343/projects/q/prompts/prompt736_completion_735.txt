  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, so if `this` is not undefined, the test will fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this !== this
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, so if `this` is not itself, the test will fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this && this === this
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator checks for truthiness, so if `this` is undefined, the test will pass.

DONE.
