  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['INFINITY'];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `parse` function to return `Complex.INFINITY` instead of `Complex.NAN` when the input is `NaN`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['NAN'];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `parse` function to return `Complex.NAN` instead of `Complex.INFINITY` when the input is `NaN`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['ZERO'];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `parse` function to return `Complex.ZERO` instead of `Complex.NAN` when the input is `NaN`.

DONE.
