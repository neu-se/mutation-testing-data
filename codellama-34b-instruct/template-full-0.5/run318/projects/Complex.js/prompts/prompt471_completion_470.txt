  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the imaginary part is equal to 0, while the new code checks if it is not equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the imaginary part is equal to 0, while the new code checks if the real part is equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] + this['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the imaginary part is equal to 0, while the new code checks if the sum of the real and imaginary parts is equal to 0.

DONE.
