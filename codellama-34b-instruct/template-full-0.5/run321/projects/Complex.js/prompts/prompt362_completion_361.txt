  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would always add 1 to the value of `a`, regardless of its original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would always subtract 1 from the value of `a`, regardless of its original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would always double the value of `a`, regardless of its original value.

DONE.
