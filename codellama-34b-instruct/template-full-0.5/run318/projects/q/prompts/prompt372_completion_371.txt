  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.onerror` is a function that is not defined in the provided code snippet, so it would cause a `ReferenceError` when the code is executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would define a new function for `Q.onerror`, which is not defined in the provided code snippet, and would not cause any errors when the code is executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function () { throw new Error(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would define a new function for `Q.onerror` that throws an error when it is called, which would cause the code to behave differently than the original code.

DONE.
