  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.insert()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be inserting a new operation into the delta, whereas the original code is simply retaining the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be deleting the current operation from the delta, whereas the original code is simply retaining it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be retaining the current operation with a null length, whereas the original code is retaining it with a positive length.

DONE.
