  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos(sinφ2);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.acos()` returns the arccosine of a number, which is the angle in radians whose cosine is that number. In this case, `sinφ2` is the sine of the computed latitude, which means that using `Math.acos()` instead of `asin()` would return the complementary latitude, which is not what we want.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(y, x);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan2()` returns the arctangent of the ratio of two numbers, which is the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the ray from the origin to the point (x, y). In this case, `y` and `x` are the sine and cosine of the bearing angle, respectively, so using `Math.atan2()` would return the bearing angle, which is not what we want.
