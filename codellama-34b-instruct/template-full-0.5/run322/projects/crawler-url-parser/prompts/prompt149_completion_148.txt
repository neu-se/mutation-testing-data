  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split("/")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the path into an array of substrings using "/" as the separator, whereas the original code fragment splits the path using the regular expression `/\//`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split("")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the path into an array of single characters, whereas the original code fragment splits the path into an array of substrings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace("/", "")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace all occurrences of "/" in the path with an empty string, whereas the original code fragment splits the path into an array of substrings.

DONE.
