Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.unshift(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the resolver to the beginning of the `nodeArgs` array instead of the end, which may cause the callback to be invoked with the wrong arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes `null` instead of the resolver, which means the callback will not be able to resolve or reject the promise correctly, leading to unhandled promise rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.resolve);
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `resolve` method instead of the `makeNodeResolver`, which would not properly handle the Node-style callback, potentially causing the promise to never resolve or reject.

DONE.
