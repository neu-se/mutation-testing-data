  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy()
```
This would result in different behavior because `destroy()` would close the write stream immediately, without waiting for any pending writes to complete. This could result in data loss or corruption if the stream is not properly closed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because `end()` would close the write stream immediately, without waiting for any pending writes to complete. This could result in data loss or corruption if the stream is not properly closed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.close()
```
This would result in different behavior because `close()` would close the write stream immediately, without waiting for any pending writes to complete. This could result in data loss or corruption if the stream is not properly closed.

DONE.
