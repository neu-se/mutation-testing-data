  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(result) {
    return result + 1;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is not called on the original promise, but on the result of the original promise. This means that the callback function will not be called with the original value of the promise, but with the result of the previous callback function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(result) {
    return result * 2;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is not called on the original promise, but on the result of the original promise. This means that the callback function will not be called with the original value of the promise, but with the result of the previous callback function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(result) {
    return result - 1;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the
