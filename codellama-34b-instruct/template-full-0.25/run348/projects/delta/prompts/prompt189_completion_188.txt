  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes && <PLACEHOLDER>
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would cause the code to only execute if `attributes` is truthy, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes || <PLACEHOLDER>
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would cause the code to only execute if `attributes` is falsy, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes ? <PLACEHOLDER> : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the ternary operator would cause the code to execute if `attributes` is truthy, and return `null` otherwise, which may not be the desired behavior.

DONE.
