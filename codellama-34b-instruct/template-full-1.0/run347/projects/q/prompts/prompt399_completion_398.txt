  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.otherwise
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherwise` is a method that allows for handling branches that were not present in the original Promise chain, which is not the intended behavior for the code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.inspect
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect` is a method that allows for inspecting the state of a Promise, which is not the intended behavior for the code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a method that allows for creating a rejected promise, which is not the intended behavior for the code fragment.

DONE.
