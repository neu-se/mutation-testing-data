  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now matching a space character instead of an empty string, which would cause the `replace` method to replace the first space character in the string with an empty string, instead of removing the fragment from the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, '?'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now matching a question mark character instead of an empty string, which would cause the `replace` method to replace the first question mark character in the string with an empty string, instead of removing the fragment from the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now matching an empty string instead of a space character, which would cause the `replace` method to remove the fragment from the URL.

DONE.
