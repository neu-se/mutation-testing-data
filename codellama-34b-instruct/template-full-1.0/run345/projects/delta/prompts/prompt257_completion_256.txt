  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNotEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because `isEqual` checks whether two values are equal, while `isNotEqual` checks whether they are not equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<
```
This would result in different behavior because `isEqual` checks for equality, while the `<` operator checks if a value is less than another value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
>
```
This would result in different behavior because `isEqual` checks for equality, while the `>` operator checks if a value is greater than another value.

DONE.
