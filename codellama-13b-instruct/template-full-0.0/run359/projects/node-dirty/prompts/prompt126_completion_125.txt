  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'read_close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event 'read_close' is emitted when the read stream is closed, whereas the original code fragment emits the event 'write_close' when the write stream is closed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event 'error' is emitted when an error occurs, whereas the original code fragment emits the event 'write_close' when the write stream is closed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event 'drain' is emitted when the write stream is drained, whereas the original code fragment emits the event 'write_close' when the write stream is closed.

DONE.
