  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `switch` statement would always fall through to the `default` case, even when the `length` is greater than 4.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `switch` statement would never fall through to the `default` case, even when the `length` is greater than 4.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `switch` statement would always fall through to the `default` case, even when the `length` is less than 4.

DONE.
