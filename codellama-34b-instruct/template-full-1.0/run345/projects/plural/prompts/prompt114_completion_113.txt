  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
illnesses
```
This would result in different behavior because `illnesses` is not defined in the code, whereas `games` is defined as a variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(Math.random() * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor(Math.random() * 2)` generates a random integer between 0 and 1, whereas `games` is a constant array of strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"games".split("").reverse().join("")
```
This would result in different behavior because `"games".split("").reverse().join("")` reverses the letters in the string "games", whereas `games` is a constant array of strings.

DONE.
