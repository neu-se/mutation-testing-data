  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ retain: length }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` operation would be applied instead of the `delete` operation, which would cause the delta to retain the characters instead of deleting them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ delete: length + 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` operation would be applied with an offset of 1, which would cause the delta to delete one more character than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ delete: length - 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` operation would be applied with an offset of -1, which would cause the delta to delete one fewer character than intended.

DONE.
