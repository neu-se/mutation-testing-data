Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackRejection(this, reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly track the rejection of the promise again instead of untracking it, leading to potential memory leaks and incorrect handling of unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last promise from the `unhandledRejections` array instead of the specific promise that was rejected, potentially causing incorrect tracking of which promises have been handled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
untrackRejection(promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `untrackRejection` on the promise itself, which may not be the intended behavior if the promise has already been handled, leading to inconsistencies in the tracking state.

DONE.
