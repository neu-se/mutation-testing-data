  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (false) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would always evaluate to `false`, which would cause the `return` statement to be skipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `return` statement would be returning a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `return` statement would be returning a different value than the original code.

DONE.
