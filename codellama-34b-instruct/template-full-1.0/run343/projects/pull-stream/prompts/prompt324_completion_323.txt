  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === true ? null : null
```
This would result in different behavior because now the function will always return `null` instead of `abort`, which could cause the code that relies on this function to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === true ? 'error' : abort
```
This would result in different behavior because now the function will return the string `'error'` instead of `abort`, which could cause the code that relies on this function to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === true ? null : undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because now the function will return `undefined` instead of `abort`, which could cause the code that relies on this function to fail.

DONE.
