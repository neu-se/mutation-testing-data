  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 'suffix'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the key by appending the string 'suffix' to it, which would prevent the original key from being looked up in the hash map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the key by decrementing it by 1, which would result in a different index being looked up in the hash map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'prefix-' + key
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the key by prepending the string 'prefix-' to it, which would prevent the original key from being looked up in the hash map.

DONE.
