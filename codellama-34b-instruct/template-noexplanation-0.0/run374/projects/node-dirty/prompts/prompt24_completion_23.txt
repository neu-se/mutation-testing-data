  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb
```
This will negate the value of `cb`, so if it was truthy, it will become falsy, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb && false
```
This will always return `false`, regardless of the value of `cb`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb || true
```
This will always return `true`, regardless of the value of `cb`.

DONE.
