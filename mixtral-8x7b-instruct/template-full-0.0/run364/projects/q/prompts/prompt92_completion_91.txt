 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the initial value check would always pass, bypassing the loop to find the first value in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the initial value check would always pass, even if the array is empty, and the loop to find the first value in the array would not be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
index < this.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the reduction would stop one iteration early, excluding the last element in the array from the reduction.

DONE.
