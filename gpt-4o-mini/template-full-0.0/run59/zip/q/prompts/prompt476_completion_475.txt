Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` removes the last element from the `unhandledRejections` array instead of removing the specific promise at index `at`, potentially leading to incorrect tracking of unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.splice(at, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because using `0` as the second argument to `splice()` does not remove any elements from the array, effectively leaving the `unhandledRejections` array unchanged, which could lead to incorrect handling of untracked promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections[at] = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because setting the element at index `at` to `null` does not remove the promise from the `unhandledRejections` array, but instead replaces it with `null`, which could cause confusion and incorrect state management in the rejection tracking.

DONE.
