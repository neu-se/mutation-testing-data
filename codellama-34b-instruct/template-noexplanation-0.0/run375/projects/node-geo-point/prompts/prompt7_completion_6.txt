  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type !== 'Point' || !Array.isArray(point.coordinates) || point.coordinates.length !== 2
```
This code fragment checks that the `type` property of the `point` object is not equal to `'Point'`, or that the `coordinates` property is not an array with two elements. This change will cause the `fromGeoJSON` method to throw a `TypeError` if the `point` object does not have the expected properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!point.hasOwnProperty('type') || !point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates') || point.coordinates.length !== 2
```
This code fragment checks that the `point` object does not have the `type` and `coordinates` properties, or that the `coordinates` property is not an array with two elements. This change will cause the `fromGeoJSON` method to throw a `TypeError` if the `point` object does not have the expected properties.
