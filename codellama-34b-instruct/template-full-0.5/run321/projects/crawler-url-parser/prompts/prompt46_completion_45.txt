  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.format(parsedBaseUrl, {fragment: false})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fragment` option is set to `false`, which would cause the fragment (i.e., the part of the URL after the `#` symbol) to be removed from the formatted URL. This could potentially break any code that relies on the fragment being present in the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.format(parsedBaseUrl, {protocol: 'https:'})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `protocol` option is set to `https:`, which would cause the protocol (i.e., the part of the URL before the `://` symbol) to be set to `https:` instead of the original protocol. This could potentially break any code that relies on the protocol being a certain value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.format(parsedBaseUrl, {hostname: 'example.com'})
