  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'coordinates'[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check the first element of the `coordinates` array, rather than the entire array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'coordinates'[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check the second element of the `coordinates` array, rather than the entire array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'coordinates'[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check the third element of the `coordinates` array, rather than the entire array.

DONE.
