Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.map(op => op);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new array containing all the operations without filtering them based on the predicate, effectively ignoring the filtering logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.filter(op => !predicate(op, 0));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of operations that do not satisfy the predicate, which is the opposite of the intended filtering behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.reduce((acc, op) => acc.concat(op), []);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would flatten the operations into a single array, losing the structure of the original array and not applying any filtering based on the predicate.

DONE.
