  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry('invalid_id')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a country with an invalid ID, which would not be covered by the current tests.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone('invalid_name')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a timezone with an invalid name, which would not be covered by the current tests.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountriesForTimezone('invalid_tzName')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an empty list of countries instead of the expected list of countries for an invalid timezone.
DONE.
