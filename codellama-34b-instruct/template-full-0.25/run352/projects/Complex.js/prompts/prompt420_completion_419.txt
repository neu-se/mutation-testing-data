  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite` checks if the complex number is infinite, while `isZero` checks if it is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `!` is the logical NOT operator, which would invert the result of `isZero`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the imaginary part of the complex number is not zero, while `isZero` checks if the real and imaginary parts are both zero.

DONE.
