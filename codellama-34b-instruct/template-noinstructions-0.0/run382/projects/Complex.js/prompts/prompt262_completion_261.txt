  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a, b` is a tuple of two values, while `a + b` is a single value that is the sum of `a` and `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a, b` is a tuple of two values, while `a - b` is a single value that is the difference of `a` and `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a, b` is a tuple of two values, while `a * b` is a single value that is the product of `a` and `b`.

DONE.
