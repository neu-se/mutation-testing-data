  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/[*+]/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if the first occurrence of "*" or "+" exists in the path, rather than checking if they are followed by a slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/[*+]+/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would require that the first occurrence of "*" or "+" is repeated at least once, rather than checking if they are followed by a slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/[*+]\//) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would require that the "*" or "+" is followed by a slash, rather than just checking for its existence.

DONE.
