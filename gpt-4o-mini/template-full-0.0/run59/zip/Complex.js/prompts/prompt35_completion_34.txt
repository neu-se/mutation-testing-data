Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly allow the logarithm calculation to proceed when `b` is non-zero, potentially leading to incorrect results when `a` is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `a` is negative instead of checking if `b` is zero, which would lead to incorrect handling of logarithmic calculations when `a` is negative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only allow the logarithm calculation to proceed if `a` and `b` are equal, which is not the intended logic and could lead to incorrect results for valid inputs.

DONE.
