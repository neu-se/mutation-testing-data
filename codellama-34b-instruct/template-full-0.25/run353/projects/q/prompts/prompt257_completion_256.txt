  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(reject(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` would be called instead of `fulfill`, causing the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(fulfill(undefined));
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill` would be called with `undefined` instead of the original value, causing the promise to be resolved to a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(Q(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q` would be called with the original value, causing the promise to be resolved to a different promise.

DONE.
