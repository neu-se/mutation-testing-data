  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the result of the `test` function, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if the `test` function returned `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` regardless of the result of the `test` function, since `false` is a falsy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test || false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` regardless of the result of the `test` function, since `false` is a falsy value.

DONE.
