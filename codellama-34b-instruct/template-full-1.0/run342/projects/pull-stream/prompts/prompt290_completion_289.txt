  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the `field` value, which would make the `nonUnique` function return a different value for the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the `field` value by 2, which would make the `nonUnique` function return a different value for the same input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the `field` value to upper case, which would make the `nonUnique` function return a different value for the same input.

DONE.
