Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.format
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.format` is used to format a URL object into a string, whereas `URL.parse` is used to parse a URL string into an object. This change would lead to incorrect handling of the `baseUrlStr`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.resolve` is used to resolve a target URL relative to a base URL, which does not parse the base URL into its components like `URL.parse` does. This would cause the function to fail in correctly constructing the absolute URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because changing the first argument to `false` would prevent the URL from being parsed as a relative URL, which could lead to incorrect parsing of the `baseUrlStr` and potentially return an invalid URL object.

DONE.
