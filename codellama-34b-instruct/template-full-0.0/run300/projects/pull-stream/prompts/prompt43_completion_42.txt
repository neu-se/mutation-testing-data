  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref.slice()` returns a shallow copy of the `ref` array, whereas `ref` returns the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref.concat()` returns a new array that is the result of concatenating `ref` with the arguments passed to it, whereas `ref` returns the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.map(function(x) { return x })
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref.map()` returns a new array that is the result of applying the provided function to each element of `ref`, whereas `ref` returns the original array.

DONE.
