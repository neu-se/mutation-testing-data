 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
name
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array is not being passed to the `dispatch` method. This change may cause the method to not receive the necessary arguments and potentially fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array is not being passed to the `dispatch` method. Instead, `null` is being passed. This change may cause the method to not receive the necessary arguments and potentially fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve
