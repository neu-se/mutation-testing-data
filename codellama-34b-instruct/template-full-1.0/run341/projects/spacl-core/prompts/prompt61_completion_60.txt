  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^.+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original regex, `/^.+$`, matches any string with at least one character, while the replaced regex, `/^.+$/`, matches any string with at least two characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[^/]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original regex, `/^.+$/`, matches any string with at least one character, while the replaced regex, `/^[^/]+$/`, matches any string with at least one character that is not a forward slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[0-9]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original regex, `/^.+$/`, matches any string with at least one character, while the replaced regex, `/^[0-9]+$/`, matches any string with at least one digit.

DONE.
