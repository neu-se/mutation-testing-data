 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return callback; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise from `fin` would always resolve to the callback function instead of invoking it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback()
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would be invoked immediately, instead of waiting for the promise to settle.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of `this` inside the callback, potentially causing issues if the callback relies on a specific context.

DONE.
