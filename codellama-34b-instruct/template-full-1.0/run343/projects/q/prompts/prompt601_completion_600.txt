  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self
```
This would result in different behavior because `self` is a keyword in Python that refers to the current object, whereas `Q` is a variable name that references a promise object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a value that represents the absence of any object value, whereas `Q` is a variable name that references a promise object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `function () {}` is an anonymous function expression that defines a new function object, whereas `Q` is a variable name that references a promise object.

DONE.
