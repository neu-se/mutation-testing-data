  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
count < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would always evaluate to false, causing the `matches` method to always return false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
count === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would always evaluate to true, causing the `matches` method to always return true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
count > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would always evaluate to true, causing the `matches` method to always return true.

DONE.
