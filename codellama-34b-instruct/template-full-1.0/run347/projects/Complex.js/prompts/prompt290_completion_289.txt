  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the result of the function would always be 1, instead of depending on the input value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
('a' + 'b')
```
This would result in different behavior because the result of the function would always be the concatenation of the strings "a" and "b", instead of depending on the input value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a % 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the result of the function would always be 0 or 1, depending on whether the input value is even or odd, instead of depending on the input value.

DONE.
