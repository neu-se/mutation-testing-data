  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mouse'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns 'mice' when the word is 'mouse', while the buggy code fragment returns 'mouse' when the word is 'mouse'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mouses'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns 'mice' when the word is 'mouses', while the buggy code fragment returns 'mouses' when the word is 'mouses'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mice'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns 'mice' when the word is 'mice', while the buggy code fragment returns 'mice' when the word is 'mice'.

DONE.
