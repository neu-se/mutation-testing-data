  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:tea|sugar|water|air|rice|knowledge|beauty|anger|fear|love|money|research|safety|evidence)\b/i, function(w) { return w.toUpperCase() }
```
This code fragment will uppercase the word before returning it, which will cause the test to fail if the word is not already uppercase.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:tea|sugar|water|air|rice|knowledge|beauty|anger|fear|love|money|research|safety|evidence)\b/i, function(w) { return w.substr(1) }
```
This code fragment will return the word without its first letter, which will cause the test to fail if the word is not already without its first letter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?
