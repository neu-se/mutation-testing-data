  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by 2 would double the distance, which would cause the destination point to be calculated incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance - 100
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 100 would reduce the distance, which would cause the destination point to be calculated incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance + 100
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 100 would increase the distance, which would cause the destination point to be calculated incorrectly.

DONE.
