  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/ics$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the plural form of words ending in -ics to -ices, whereas the original code fragment would keep the plural form the same.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/ics$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the plural form of words ending in -ics to -s, whereas the original code fragment would keep the plural form the same.
