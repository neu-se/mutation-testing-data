  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['INFINITY'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a complex number with a real part of 0 and an imaginary part of 0, while the modified code fragment returns a special value representing infinity.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['NAN'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a complex number with a real part of 0 and an imaginary part of 0, while the modified code fragment returns a special value representing Not a Number (NaN).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(0, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a special value representing infinity, while the modified code fragment returns a complex number with a real part of 0 and an imaginary part of 0.

DONE.
