  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === true ? null : end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `end` is `true` and returns `null` if it is, while the modified code fragment returns `end` regardless of its value. This could cause issues if the `end` value is not `true` but still indicates the end of the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === true ? null : acc
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `end` is `true` and returns `null` if it is, while the modified code fragment returns `acc` regardless of its value. This could cause issues if the `end` value is not `true` but still indicates the end of the stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === true ? null : data
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `end` is `true` and returns `null` if it
