  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert === true
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.insert` is a string, and `===` checks for both value and type equality. In this case, the string "null" would not be considered equal to the boolean value `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert != undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value than `null`, and `!=` checks for value inequality. In this case, the string "null" would be considered unequal to `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `!==` checks for both value and type equality. In this case, the string "null" would not be considered equal to the `null` value.

DONE.
