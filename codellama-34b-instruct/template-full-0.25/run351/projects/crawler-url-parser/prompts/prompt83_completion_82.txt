  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the `href` attribute of the current element, which may not be the same as the value of the `href` attribute of the `a` element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href').replace(/;.*$/g,"")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove any semicolons and everything after them from the value of the `href` attribute, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href').replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'http://')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the `http://` protocol to the value of the `href` attribute if it does not already have a protocol, which may not be the desired behavior.

DONE.
