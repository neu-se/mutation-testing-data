  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `.inspect()` method to return the state of the promise as "rejected," rather than "pending," which could lead to incorrect assumptions about the state of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `.inspect()` method to return the state of the promise as "pending," which could lead to false assumptions about the state of the promise, or cause the promise to be resolved incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `.inspect()` method to return the state of the promise as "fulfilled," which could lead to incorrect assumptions about the state of the promise, or cause the promise to be resolved incorrectly.

DONE.
