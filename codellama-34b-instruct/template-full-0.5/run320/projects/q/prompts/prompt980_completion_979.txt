  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is called with an additional argument, which would cause it to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver().reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse` method is called on the result of `makeNodeResolver`, which would cause it to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver().toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString` method is called on the result of `makeNodeResolver`, which would cause it to return a different value.

DONE.
