 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` for `matches` method, regardless of the rule's `matches` result, since an empty object is always truthy in JavaScript.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` for `matches` method, since `null` is falsy in JavaScript.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules[0].matches(path, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check the first rule's `matches` method, ignoring the rest of the rules in the policy.

DONE.
