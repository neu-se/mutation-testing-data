  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c[0], options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first element of the `c` array to the `getCountry` function, whereas the original code passes the entire `c` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c[1], options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the second element of the `c` array to the `getCountry` function, whereas the original code passes the entire `c` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c.length, options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the length of the `c` array to the `getCountry` function, whereas the original code passes the entire `c` array.

DONE.
