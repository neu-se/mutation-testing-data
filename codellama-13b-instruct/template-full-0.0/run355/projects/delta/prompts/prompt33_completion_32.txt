  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attr[key] !== base[key] && base[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `base[key]` is `undefined`, while the new code fragment checks if it is not `undefined`. This could cause the function to return a different result, potentially leading to a bug.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attr[key] !== base[key] || base[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `base[key]` is `undefined`, while the new code fragment checks if it is not `undefined` or if `attr[key]` is not equal to `base[key]`. This could cause the function to return a different result, potentially leading to a bug.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attr[key] === base[key] && base[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `
