  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude * Math.PI / 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the longitude value is used in place of the latitude, which would cause the calculation to be off by 90 degrees.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by 2 would cause the calculation to be twice as large, which would lead to an incorrect latitude value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude * Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by Pi would cause the calculation to be off by a factor of 3.14, which would lead to an incorrect latitude value.

DONE.
