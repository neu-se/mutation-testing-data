  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator is used instead of `==`, which would cause the code to behave differently when `thisOp.retain` is `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator is used instead of `==`, which would cause the code to behave differently when `thisOp.retain` is not `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator is used instead of `==`, which would cause the code to behave differently when `thisOp.retain` is `undefined`.

DONE.
