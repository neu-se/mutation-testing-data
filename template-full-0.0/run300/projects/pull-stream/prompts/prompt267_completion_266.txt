  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `end` value, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` and the `nextStream` function to be called, even if the `end` value is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && stream
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator checks if both `end` and `stream` are truthy values, and if so, returns the value of `stream`. If `end` is `false`, the `if` statement would evaluate to `false` and the `nextStream` function would not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || stream
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator checks if either `end` or `stream` are truthy values, and if so, returns the value of `stream`. If `end` is `false`, the `if`
