  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` returns a rejected promise, while `Q` returns a fulfilled promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(null, function() { return object; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method with a rejection callback would return a rejected promise, while `Q` returns a fulfilled promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(function() { throw object; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method with a rejection callback that throws an error would return a rejected promise, while `Q` returns a fulfilled promise.

DONE.
