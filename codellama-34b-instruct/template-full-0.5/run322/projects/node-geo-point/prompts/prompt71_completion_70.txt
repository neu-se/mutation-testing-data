  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculation would be off by 180 degrees, which would lead to incorrect results in the `calculateDestination` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculation would be off by a factor of 2, which would lead to incorrect results in the `calculateDestination` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ - Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculation would be off by 180 degrees, which would lead to incorrect results in the `calculateDestination` method.

DONE.
