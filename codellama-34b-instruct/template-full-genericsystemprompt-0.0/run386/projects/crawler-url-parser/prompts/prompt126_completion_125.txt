  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(linkurl.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would parse the URL of the link, rather than the link itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.href
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the href attribute of the link, rather than the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.protocol + linkurl.host + linkurl.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the protocol, host, and pathname of the link, rather than the URL.

DONE.
