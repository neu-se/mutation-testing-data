 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object, which is not the same as calling `deferred.makeNodeResolver()`. The `makeNodeResolver()` method returns a function that is used to resolve the deferred promise with Node.js-style callbacks. By replacing it with an empty object, the promise will never be resolved or rejected, and any further operations depending on this promise will not complete as expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, not a function. The `makeNodeResolver()` method returns a function that is used to resolve the deferred promise with Node.js-style callbacks. By replacing it with `null`, you would get a TypeError when trying to call `null` as a function in the `Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).fail(deferred.reject);` line.
