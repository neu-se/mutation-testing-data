  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end.tail = end.tail + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of `end.tail`, which is used later in the code to compute the result of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end.tail = end.head;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set `end.tail` to the same value as `end.head`, which would cause the code to enter an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end.tail = "error";
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set `end.tail` to a string value, which would cause an error when the code tries to use it as a function later.

DONE.
