  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([.$])/g, '\\$2'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is using the wrong capture group. The original code fragment uses `$1` to refer to the first capture group, but the new code fragment uses `$2`, which does not exist.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([.$])/g, '\\$&'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is using the wrong capture group. The original code fragment uses `$1` to refer to the first capture group, but the new code fragment uses `$&`, which refers to the entire match.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([.$])/g, '\\$0'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is using the wrong capture group. The original code fragment uses `$1` to refer to the first capture group, but the new code fragment uses `$0`, which refers to the entire match.
