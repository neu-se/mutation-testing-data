  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherData
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of `otherData` instead of the length of the operation, which could cause the code to behave differently if the value of `otherData` is not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisData
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of `thisData` instead of the length of the operation, which could cause the code to behave differently if the value of `thisData` is not a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return twice the length of the operation, which could cause the code to behave differently if the length of the operation is not 1.

DONE.
