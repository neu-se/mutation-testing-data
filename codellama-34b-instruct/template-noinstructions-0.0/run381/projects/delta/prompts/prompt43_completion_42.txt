  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `diff` function would return a different result, as the `NULL_CHARACTER` would be considered a valid character in the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `diff` function would return a different result, as the `NULL_CHARACTER` would be considered a valid character in the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `diff` function would return a different result, as the `NULL_CHARACTER` would be considered a valid character in the string.

DONE.
